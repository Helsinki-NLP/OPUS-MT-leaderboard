Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned about "identifying them as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly expressed their dismay at the proposed title change by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen at the root of the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all the different political parties have expressed their concern that this measure may become a source of mockery.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his party was concerned that MWP "remains with Twp or Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the party's assembly Plaid Cymru has commented that his party as a whole "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh conservative member has claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but he also commented that there is too little difference between the terms "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the English letter "u" in Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly in charge of drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint the members of the assembly will of course fall on the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Assembly of Wales all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee opted for "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the "MWP" option received wider support for the public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach consensus can be quite a headache for the Speaker of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly shall hold the final vote on their name during the debate on legislation.
Macedonians will vote in referendum to change their country's name
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a way to reclaim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country’s attempts to become part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the older people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church around every corner,” Adams says.
“Today, there is none of us left.”
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
“People have a different way of socializing today,” he says.
“Bars have already ceased to be the kind of living rooms for the neighborhood where people used to go regularly.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money that is obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders predict "and that sooner or later they will return to the place where they came from."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will not be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore what they will do will be to accelerate the closure of all churches, since it is entirely unlikely that most people who move to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that existed originally left during the 1930s.
A black congregation nearby acquired ownership of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retail merchants on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the carriageway.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, proudly described the carillon as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who sounded the carillon in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the first carriage in the world that was touched by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest carriage at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded in St. Martin's in recent months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them carried by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing its concern that the diocese "intended to pass on the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy While Hunting for Locusts in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving to hunt for locusts in California on the first day of the locust season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of a boy asking for help. Then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was the joy of having picked up a lobster, but then he "realized he was shouting 'I've been bitten!
They bit me!'
He had his entire collarbone torn off," Hammel observed as he got to the boy.
“In order for everyone to get out of the water, I shouted, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in serious condition.
It is not known which species of shark was responsible for the attack.
At a news conference, lifeguard Larry Giles said he was working for weeks when a shark had been spotted in the area, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities closed for 48 hours access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas because of the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans, towards the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product aisles in the style of department stores occupied with specialized employees.
These large aisles are just part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the UK, a market that moves around <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as the fashion and home products sectors lag behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their shelves that was previously destined for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of brands similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique makeup products so that most of the products are now vegan-friendly, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two Sainsbury's stores. The first did so last week in Croydon, South London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made large supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly resemble department stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to relaunch grocery sales and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's did a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended up precipitously not agreeing on how to split the profits of the pharmacy chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
According to Sainsbury’s, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury skin products brands, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, comments: “We have transformed the look of our beauty product aisles in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help when offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and convenient location make us now one of the favorite destinations for beauty products and we challenge the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby backs off <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons' star Peter Jones left "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby backed off a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to devote himself to the joint business of household products and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning anchor used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones enraged by retiring at the last minute from the lucrative lifestyle brand joint venture to focus on her new own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring her great profits.
According to several sources, Jones was "furious" when the blonde TV star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new agreements of the presenter, worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, implied that she would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was destined to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to back down left all parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.”
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had had an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president last March.
Both couples spend the holidays together. In addition, Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the next brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "We will not comment on his business".
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "little like a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mocking the tone of a news anchor:
“I have not given up on anything.”
He noted that Kim had an interest in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “corresponding response” by the United States to its country’s first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s views, on the other hand, were much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: an end to missile tests, help to release hostages and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded compound, we’d have about 200,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds killed in tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," says Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not safe even if foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute to providing aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia is suffering, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, even if there was a warning in place, is very likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Moving between the huge number of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is now heading for Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's ill-fated infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railroads.
However, Joko's government faces the coming year's re-election loaded with funding shortfalls.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's continuing sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 dead and tens of thousands displaced are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes the goal of the draw with a far shot against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team was losing 1-0.
He settled the ball to the left before dropping an incredible shot aimed at the second stick.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great elevation as it propelled towards the right cross of the goal.
The ball finally began the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position so I could shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch and I didn’t think much about it, I just dedicated myself to shooting.”
Chelsea won 1-0 at rest after scoring a goal in the 25th minute with their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, Team Blue's striker came back from a pass to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost midfield and sprinting towards Liverpool's field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the midfield.
He then made a magnificent deep pass, leaving Hazard within the area with the ball controlled.
Hazard overcame the defense to finish on the second post with a left-legged shot that Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to data from the country’s disaster agency released on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of the collapsed buildings due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday that caused waves of up to 6 meters, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man as Suspect in Murder After Finding Woman Stabbed
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with several stabbings at Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the residents of the area to have seen or heard something related to the crime to present themselves before the authorities.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "While the investigation is still at a preliminary stage, I would like to appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the on-board camera of the car, to contact them, as they may have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body they found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the scene of the crime to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigations continue, police have said they are informing the family members closest to the victim of the incident.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his flat, but police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are being warned that they will spend hours until they can re-enter.
He could feel like a police officer was telling a man that the whole area is being treated as the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
He keeps repeating, “It’s terrible!”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordoned off area with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained within the cordoned off area controlling the block of flats.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously through 0800 555 111 and mentioning file 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction in the purest Taliban style of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of Westminster Palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than he is now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously from the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a topic of historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.”
Killer pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, local sources say.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and covered in blood near a pig court at Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to a contiguous pig court.
According to him, there was a large male pig in the court with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kg piggy banker had fatally wounded the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were shattered and full of blood,” said the cousin, surnamed “Wu,” as mentioned in Guiyang’s evening news.
Scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented in the evening news that the pig remained closed and isolated in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene of the crime.
Yuan’s family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Despite being very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 300 kg caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are normally not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They like to play.
They are like children, they are very curious... they do not go with the idea of hurting.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to be weakening as it advances over the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, typical of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning Eastern U.S. time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is starting to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave strong tropical moisture northward to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical humidity will then interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste streams, and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility that rivers will form, since the situation is getting worse very quickly due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged from entering the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms can carry wind gusts and dust clouds at specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains at certain points off the coast of Southern California.
It is possible to record total rainfall above 50 mm, which could lead to minor waste streams and slippery paths.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Isolated tropical rain showers will begin arriving in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread to the region of the Four Corners on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
In October there will be several major temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic temperature changes in a short distance.
The central U.S. region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of almost 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected to start in October with heat in much of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures around 27 degrees from the South Plains area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could hit 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there are many chances of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million viewers watched Thursday the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony was broadcast on six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting Friday's usual schedule due to a turn of events at the last minute: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers saw this testimony on Friday.
The company had an average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not immediately available for other channels that rebroadcast the testimonial, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble calculating the people who see it from his office.
Put in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football playoff game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the most watched channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day testimony, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS earned $3.1 million, NBC $2.94 million, MSNBC $2.89 million, and CNN $2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest remains high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was scolded by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator to go to a committee hearing on judicial matters.
Flake spent several minutes looking down while being filmed live on television on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said to him, ‘You have power, while there are so many women who don’t have it!’
Flake said his office had issued a communiqué and, before the elevator doors were closed, commented that he would have more to say in view of the committee.
Within hours, all cable and broadcast channels were already broadcasting live the moment when the Judiciary Committee had to vote on whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate floor for a vote.
Flake said, however, that he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee for next week, a condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was influential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and of disregarding the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview in addition to the one with May on the front page of the newspaper, the former foreign minister of May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, where he states that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect taxes from each other is "absurdly absurd".
Wayde Sims Shooting Murder: Police Detain Suspect Dyteon Simpson for the Death of the LSU Team Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was on the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison for second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they had found Simpson’s DNA in them, according to the CBS WAFB affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted that Wayde had been shot dead, according to police.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge District Coroner’s Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head toward the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that culminated in the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the area’s law enforcement for their “diligence and seeking justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU team basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "devastated" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow".
“Things like this are the ones that make you suffer at all times,” Wade said.
An ash spit volcano in Mexico City
The ash splashed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center was overseeing several rumblings and tremors that had occurred recently.
Images on social networks where a thin layer of ash was seen on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the Catalan vote on their secession.
A group of pro-independence individuals detained by riot police began throwing eggs and powdered paint at them, prompting the appearance of dark clouds of dust on the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later the same day, there were beatings with police, who used their batons to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “Don’t forget, don’t forgive” face-to-face with unionist protesters shouting “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not subsided in this region of independence-mindedness a year after a referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but equally carried out by Catalan separatists was held on 1 October.
Voters chose independence by an overwhelming majority, although the turnout was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting entering polling stations across the region, prompting violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place in the same way, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narc<0xC3><0xAD>s Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the pro-independence demonstration along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope for the possibility of Catalonia achieving independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy because I could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, albeit by a small margin, in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, as many of their main leaders find themselves in self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and says that the conflict has been aroused by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is only increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed before the trial since late last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Appealing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the setback in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after hitting a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point someone has fired a crossbow at the car.
Menga's move gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston was a win.
Livingston, who had moved up this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's move made the difference, as, with this victory, Gary Holt's team rise to second place, which they share with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's, on the other hand, continue not to win outside the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they separate an eight-point difference.
But before that, the Rangers received the Vienna Rapid in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, are extending their unbeaten streak in the league to six games, with a Holt as coach who still doesn’t know what the loss is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
The Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in the face of the direct game of visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scoreboard long before the goal, as his direct play caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way between the defense, but wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the goal. Afterwards, Alan Lithgow sent the ball out by stretching to try to finish Craig Halkett's header pass, which crossed the goal.
The locals were already happy to let the Rangers approach their area, as they knew that they could put visitors in trouble in isolated plays.
And that’s how this decisive goal came about.
The referee whistled a foul against the Rangers' interests and Livingston made an overture to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play it first and finish from the central part of the area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated possession, but found themselves with an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game.
The stage was repeated in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop of merit.
For his part, Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped with his feet an occasion of Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended deflected another combination play of Livingston.
The Rangers dedicated themselves to hanging up again and again balls in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for Halkett's alleged entry to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for hands. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks that they were excellent, and continue to exceed all expectations on this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top category, although much of the merit must be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be on Menga's watch throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite the brilliant moments exhibited with Gerrard as coach, they have definitely not been able to maintain the level.
They didn't know how to create chances (only once they clearly overtook the local defense), and this the Rangers, who is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Aggressive reception for Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from congregating in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around it to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinion around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and a dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist has been killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics took care of the cyclist, he died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was killed in a run-in on Childers Street, a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
Metropolitan police have said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to close relatives.
The street has been cut and deviations have been applied for bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security men's prison, according to the center's office.
The events occurred at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado" agents moved to the scene of the events to end the altercation, in which eight inmates were involved. The avalanche could be contained on one side.
Officers had to be treated for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: “We have deployed specially trained prison staff to try to resolve an incident at Long Martin Prison that still persists.
Six employees had to be treated with injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to be held accountable to the police and may have to spend even more time in jail."
In the Long Lartin prison center there are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison had to be taken to a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-riot agents made an appearance in the prison to solve a serious altercation in which staff of the center were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major rivers (dry areas could benefit)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen early next week when what remains of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued river warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and approach it on rainy Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained storm status or tropical depression within a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm would be recorded in Arizona's Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, could register 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are not at risk of rivers, the Rosa rain could become very good news, given that the region suffers a strong drought.
Although the rivers are a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, as the southwest region currently suffers a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, more than 40% of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa continued to have hurricane force on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which causes it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be heavy, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "a total of 75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm."
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm strength, before arriving at the Arizona border early Tuesday morning with tropical depression strength, to finally cross the state of Arizona and arrive in southern Utah well into the night of Tuesday.
“The main risk we expect from Rosa or what’s left of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the U.S.,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
Rainfall is expected to cause dangerous rivers and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Agents have made a call for anyone who may have some kind of recording of the events with the mobile phone to get in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to reject the merciless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at an election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, bluntly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexually abusing her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in court regarding his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw Kavanaugh’s genius, human quality and courage.”
“The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable track record of serving citizens,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while discussing the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I didn’t run, but I did,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to fight for our great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are devoting themselves to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, an aide to Republican party leaders told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, and many have been swept away by giant waves crashing into the beaches, as a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast towards sunset, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and they did not run immediately. That's why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it destroyed everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency show the number of shops and buildings destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to rock this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical features of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped in the rubble of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information came in" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse,” he said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of an amateur shared on social media, it can be felt as a man located on the top floor of a building gives desperate cries of warning to the people on the street about the tsunami that is approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water bursts at the edge of the sea, taking away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread power cut that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say the evacuees are still in desperate need of food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where the employees are sheltered in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba says.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the desolate gesture of initiating relief work, some people complained that humanitarian workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, provisions and staffing from abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘Well, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start asking for international assistance, but that level has not yet been declared.”
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing people kept hoping that the miracle would happen and their loved ones would evade the desolate account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was rescued trapped in a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional load,” he said.
Mr Gendon explained that, in the hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel’s collapse circulated among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think that means the messages weren’t received,” he added.
Thieves take $26,750 with them while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a purse of money for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote, "The being formally known as Kanye West."
It was a while ago that in West, 41 years old, they motetten him with the nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," according to the show's author.
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think it’s the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” West said earlier this year, as he talked about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s you, it’s us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former collaborator, has used his nickname with or without a dash and in capital letters.
Mexican President Amlo vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country celebrates the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "military force would never again be used to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the deaths of 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were sweeping across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI.
“While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money it spends on research in this field,” says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures on AI, although there is a general lack of formal AI strategy in the country.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in the world in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that the rest of the countries are far behind the U.S. and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the field of AI,” Lee said.
“Doubling funding could double the opportunities for the U.S. to achieve the next big discovery in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book titled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most prominent AI companies in China.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that surpassed the top-ranked American Othello player and subsequently served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively assessed previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify future visionaries.
“Usually, American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, “it’s not China that takes away the academic leaders; it’s the companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university eminences to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that U.S. work in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
“I think permanent residency cards should be offered automatically to AI doctoral students,” he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
“The National Natural Science Foundation of China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other U.S. public bodies donate money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior to China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve collaborators from the industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently spends more than $100 million a year on AI research.
In the meantime, for months no measure has been applied in relation to the US legislation intended to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold referendum on whether to change country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to the “Republic of Northern Macedonia,” a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia’s applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory and has banned it from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic-majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign casts doubt on whether the necessary minimum participation of 50% will be reached for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper of the referendum is: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created as a result of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of the registered people voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum held in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for it to join the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by the people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads held high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
Zaev said a “yes” would mean “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum necessary participation.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian channel Telma TV, 57% of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote “yes.”
In order for the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus a vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Manchester City's Sergio Agüero makes a goal after haggling all of Brighton's defense
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling canceled Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) on Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He left by speed between three Brighton defenders, sweeping what came out of his way onto the pitch.
Later, Agüero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He haggled a defense before overcoming a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left that he found Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball on the first touch, inside the area, to Agüero, who with his right leg beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that slipped into the net on the right side.
“Agüero is in trouble,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided that we would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball in depth in Brighton field and
He made a beautiful leap into space on the left-hand side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long stick.
The forward of the Sky Blues finished the ball on the inside of the net before exiting through the bottom line.
City face Hoffenheim on Tuesday in a Champions League group stage match at 18:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, with no options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off fight, there was little reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to exit the pitching mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who maintain an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have a chance to play the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a wildcard with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can go out and pitch knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably play every point at the highest level, like no one else has done this year.
“Why would I want to lose this game?”
The Nationals have yet to announce an opening pitcher for Sunday, but apparently they are determined to let Scherzer shoot if this situation arises.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a warm-up session on Thursday and would launch on Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-hander has an 18–7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike eliminations in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big.. I do not present myself, but in reality I do present myself. That is why I am everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates, "he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, it shows their meanness, their bad intention.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control. But we won’t give them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to “resist and obstruct.”
“And this can be seen in the last four days,” he rebuffed, calling the Democrats “worried, petty, dirty, and false.”
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which sparked a strong written public outcry.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no. Wait a minute... This was a very bad expression of body language, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse party.
He is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of British MPs who have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she spoke out resolutely against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, they are similar issues with respect to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the notice of the Labour Party’s Friday meeting in Nottingham it was communicated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of “generous and kind” policies has long since been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a similar political vision expected me to make a 180o turn and take positions I would never have taken, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, denounced center politics, and told that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I’m luckier than some of my colleagues, since the messages I receive are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who every day have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they don't take off.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every move of “no confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party gets tighter.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and have been advised to keep my head down, not to be so expressive and “everything would be fine”.
But I didn’t get into politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by Thatcher's negligent government, which left my entire class literally sunk, I have been trying to advocate for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councilor or as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt in any way my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will hurt homes, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in reality, the message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of not renewing my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeaten Ayr leads the lead
Two last-minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr earned the victory in this vibrant match of the day of the Tennent's Premiership.
The Ayr, who are the only unbeaten team of the ten, occupy the first position in the standings.
In the end, the local team prevailed thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to better take advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
“The games we have played so far have put us to the test and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “Congratulations to the Ayr, they’ve taken the chances better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute rehearsal, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, loaned to the match by the Warriors, allowed the Melroses to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended the Ayr's lead with a penalty and, just halfway through, scored and converted a rehearsal to put the 17-5 score in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But the Melroses started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
After the game was interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired on the bunk, and in the dam the Ayr re-enlarged the distance with a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Substitute Captain Blair Macpherson was then cautioned with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card for a ballless Climo tackle from the penalty lineup, MacPherson scored a counter-rehearsal behind the Ayr's penetrating mole.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the dam, after Kyle Rowe took a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to the third wing Gregor Henry to score the home team's fifth try.
The star of the Still Game series seems ready to start a new career in the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, appears poised to move into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comedy partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper noted that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant sector".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, landlocked, expects the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters covered with axe in La Paz.
Public buildings feature a navy blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are stamped with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
Getting it back is a duty.”
Across the landlocked territory of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century remains as vivid as the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, it expects the result with a positive posture,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the resolution of the TIJ on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will say in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign sea exit for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a contentious battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes laid in Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts think that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that, if it does, things will not change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The court’s ruling, which comes just six months after the final allegations were filed, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a setback in the past four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
“The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally quick.
Next Monday Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crossroads.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the US
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a chimera to think that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War could cause North Korea to never kneel.
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not first make major disarmament moves.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of oversized hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been razed by very impractical hats, and this designer has brought his amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's featured piece was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a wide, feather-shaped wing, which flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the brightly colored masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a complete scuba gear, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The oversized hats step on the heels of “The Bomb,” a two-footed, wide-winged straw hat that everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread on social networks brought another great creation to the catwalk: a straw bag for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed in a swimsuit that wore it.
The raffia bag, dark orange, adorned with raffia chainsaws and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see people wearing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a pity to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence that has continued into 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will come to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will come to his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest ratings in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages obtained the highest grade A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, remain in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in curricula from independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave to the fact that it was difficult for them to fill vacancies, 17% was attributed to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find an important job.
In Scotland there is diversity among schools in terms of the languages they teach.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK for the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, he or she will always be able to choose from a series of languages in independent schools, which have teaching staff specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In today’s global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be of vital importance to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communicative competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it right.

LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told the Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers, tweeted that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump Meets in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign acts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s rally in West Virginia can be viewed online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s hearing with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense over allegations of sexual abuse he is facing, while the Senate’s planned confirmation vote remains on hold for up to a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans running for the delicate November elections gain momentum.
President Trump’s five campaign rallies scheduled for next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, as we head into a busy campaign season,” a Trump spokesman said.
Tonight’s rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could rally supporters “from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him momentum in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows ambition to keep hopes alive ahead of individual matches on Sunday
After three uneven sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on what side is the positive dynamic now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I think we’re in a small positive streak,” Spieth said.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth puts it, feel the wind is blowing a little in their favor and have plenty of reasons to be excited, largely because of the fitness of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from the tee to the green and is setting an example.
The guttural cries of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his turn and he putt a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the match in hole 15 with a similar cry, such as indicating that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
“You have to do your best and care about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave an imprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
For this result and the way in which its energy seems to flow to and from the bustling public, it is reaffirmed that it is the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly broke up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning hoppers, who paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sank the Spanish and Swedish into a hole from which they never had a choice.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see because of the interactions between pairings, the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change suddenly.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with a major advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, had questioned.
Europe reaches Ryder Cup final with 10-6
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the foursomes and foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a struggling Tiger Woods and leave their record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to keep the trophy he lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team poorly in the morning heats and put the series at 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but could not narrow the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in each of Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known by the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they scored a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning forks, re-partnered with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2-to-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have everything in sight on a pleasant and windy day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They scored a 2–1 decisive victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-holes and later won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the four-holes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history had a team scored a four-point difference in individual matches, although Furyk's defending team only needed to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a coming Sunday counterattack is out of reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm 'in any way' unless signs of confidence are seen
North Korea’s foreign minister on Saturday told the United Nations that continued sanctions were intensifying its distrust of the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, let’s not observe any response in line with the U.S.,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in these circumstances, we will not unilaterally begin disarmament in any way.”
While Ri echoed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps gradually, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject the full unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump’s joint statement at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that before Pyongyang must eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that denuclearization must first occur and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, in addition to opposing the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our mistrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea instead of the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnating situation."
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President “Mr. Evil” Trump titled Kim “Rocket Man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said much remains to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization.”
The Security Council has been pushing sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then reported that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "demands of a gangster".
In a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and nuclear complex if the United States took “measures in line.”
He said Kim had told him that the “measures in line” he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep longer, in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of studying all night long, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic noted that students at the world’s number one university are often misguided by what goes into the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me all this now, in my final year?’
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, first implemented this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, which lasts one hour, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, bamboos and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects lack of sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Below, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler said.
The culture of pride in staying up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students make sleep deprivation an ever-growing problem.
Making sure you enjoy good quality sleep for long enough should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes the last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course across campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask postgraduate students to undertake a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can alter circadian rhythm harmony and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston's home that leads to another runaway.
The Ibrox team sought to add their first home win since last February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a coach to leave his team adrift, 8 points behind the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before halftime, and it never seemed that the uninspired Rangers were about to equal the score.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, the Livingston climb to third place, behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that was apparently thrown from the stand.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that swept the Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven starter who scored a point against the Hearts last week. Surely, he was satisfied with the way his well-organized team suffocated his rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated possession, the Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder kicked deflected and missed the big opportunity.
A blunt foul shot by Keaghan Jacobs ran into Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot to the back post.
The Rangers took control, but seemed to have more hope than belief in their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a penalty at the fifteen-minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless ran into each other, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only led two shots to goal in the first half, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and docile forward Oviedo Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livys at the 34th minute might have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' hard-working play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple finale.
Gerrard acted in the pause by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent. The change had a practically immediate impact, as the extreme made a pass to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture visitors' attention by playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band could have given up the direction in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow took a deflected shot from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still requested a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again turned a blind eye.

And now a page of the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as the "Geiger counter".
The Geiger counter, which has been a pillar of science ever since, also became a staple of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, seemingly failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emanating from radioactivity on minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure it's bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then reinject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer she suffered disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and, subsequently, re-inject them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: “The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein “favors the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was caught up in a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL show.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After her third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great Again hat, she began to criticize Democrats and reiterate her support for Trump.
“Whenever I talk to white people, they say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It was not clear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the audience that he was not treated well behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
“They threatened me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
They harassed me.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" as he said he would put on Superman's cape so they wouldn't be able to tell him what to do.
Try to love.”
His comments prompted the audience to write at least twice and the members of the show's team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, who had a reporter who told the publication: "The entire studio went completely silent."
West acted as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West perplexed much of the audience with the performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West obtained the support of the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE MULTITULE."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I have chosen not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince was changed to a symbol and later the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder by stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in east Belfast.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
Prosecutors will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing the role of swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of a manly hero, claiming that these roles imply that young boys often believe that they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said he believed "something had gone wrong" and that he was questioning how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that she is quite determined to face this problem.
“Personally, now I wonder where we’ve been wrong about masculinity,” he says.
“What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?”
According to Kit, television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its so-called virile characters.
He added: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have to have this facet of virility?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
“There’s definitely something wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for next summer, saying he is fed up with battles and horses.
Beginning in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best Game of Thrones has given him.
“I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life forward,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the family estate in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health workers.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are of sexual transmission, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV from this cause has fallen to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health workers at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Taking into account the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of appropriate precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies an employee leaked data from Republican Party senators and dismantles “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on the pages of the Wikipedia of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the demands were driven by critics and far-right websites.
“Lies, lies and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was posted by an unknown person on the Capitol during a Senate committee session on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to Waters' office and that it revealed the information of a Waters staff member, the Capitol denounced.
“This groundless denunciation is completely false and a sheer lie,” Waters continued.
“My staff member, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this leak of information.
This groundless denunciation is completely false and a pure invention.”
Waters' statement generated online criticism quickly, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of outrage,” Fleischer wrote.
"That makes you think you don't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn’t done, he shouldn’t be angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
You don’t have to question the accuser’s motives.
You have to be calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s important if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces to these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that offenders are disclosed, and that they will be legally held accountable for all actions they have taken that have harmed each and every member of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's limited spy parody
It is already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this reprise of Johnny English's action-comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and re-appeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Will this humorous self-satisfaction about how despicable we are be a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, incompetent rubber-eyed Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to twist everything. His name indicates more than anything that it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Evidently, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamor, has some Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy that brings a single note to the theme of Fire Carts at the inaugural ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the international traveler and mysterious Atkinson who represented Barclaycard's now-forgotten TV commercials, where he was wreaking havoc everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this last journey of JE.
I loved the Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the blades of the propeller were sticking to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is seen, but the humor seems rather fluid and strangely superfluous, especially since "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems intended for children rather than adults and, to me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as ingenious or focused as the mute gags of the character Mr. Bean portrayed by Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the service agent's dismay, a woefully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and harassed figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this treacherous character of Teresa-May, but the script does not go further.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as each active spy is endangered, he will have to recover a retired one.
And that includes the clumsy Johnny English, now employed as a teacher at some fancy institution, but giving unofficial classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his sufferer henchman Bough, who plays Ben Miller again.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of when things get very ugly in Her Majesty's secret service come into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "femme fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madness: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French fast food restaurant, sow chaos by smuggling aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all seems like a children's program.
Pretty normal things.
As with Johnny English's other films, it hasn't been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan for the British to have a four-day work week and cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to pass on the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them one more day of celebration.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The shift to a four-day working week is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to profit from economic change.
An experienced Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that fits the party’s perspective of balancing the economy in favor of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: “A four-day work week is not party politics and the party is not considering it.”
Shadow minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of “anonymous directors” and “speculators” to utility companies.
The shadow minister’s plans also imply that shareholders of water companies may not recover all the investment, as the Labour government could apply “deductions” for crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" whether Kavanaugh's FBI investigation could make them change their mind.
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence some Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be released Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I’m serious,” Kennedy said.
“In the session I said that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the accusations were made public, and I asked him if he had done so.
He was firm, determined, and sure.”
But Graham's vote seems to be engraved on fire.
“I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would present an explosive indictment,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it outright,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I'm naming will be able to verify it.
She is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything changing again.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival on Saturday, an annual music event that features an absolutely stunning program of stars, who carry out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In its seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the event’s global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively help combat it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What successes has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just another case of what we call “clictivism” (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, which have helped achieve several goals.
It states that these actions have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least USD 10 billion have already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that protected funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based association of investors and realisers, which is committed to “helping children grow as much as possible” and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the Q&A's on her website asking, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes, we will fall and fail.
But like the previous great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will feature Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington can, “if necessary” turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they are already doing in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
“The United States has the capability, together with the Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for blockade, to prevent their energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the U.S.
He compared Washington’s strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are effectively equal.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels," he said, while indicating that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the bill is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance has prompted a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (FDI), has called on the US to back away from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will “think hard” about her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think hard" about her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government fracture, for women to hold high positions,” he said.
“After November 6th, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.”
Warren intervened on President Donald Trump during the city meeting and said he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “It’s clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters believed he should not run for office by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters have said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed wider support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who were taken into account in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Quotes Affected by PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump Meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“With what’s going on with my own son since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from ramifications of PTSD and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers are returning to,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "They come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district presented an amicus curiae in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who defied the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent gang member" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
Federal laws require that asylum claims be awarded according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
“Asylum is available to those people who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum has never sought to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The atmosphere is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her feverish son at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
“Positive water is lacking.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to take flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are treated outside due to repeated heavy shakes.
Tears denied him his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was meeting his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
“I heard my wife cry for help and then I didn’t hear her anymore.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassment with “propaganda ads.”
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily’s payment supplement on Wednesday to The Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 U.S. Congressional election, a charge China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase in Washington’s campaign to intensify pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to insert advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen tariffs rise on mutual imports.
China’s vengeful tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters from states, such as Iowa, that supported Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is redoubling harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the cherished American tradition of free speech and the free press by inserting a paid advertisement in The Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the kiosk down here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and see no real reflection of the disparate views Chinese citizens may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers evaded the offer to publish" his article, but did not mention the publication's name.
Republicans steer away women’s voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several lawsuits for sexual assault, analysts have warned they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can’t be undone,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that last-minute pressure from Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation is enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, not tomorrow nor in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby while Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to the Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be off the charts,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst on the news site.
“People say they’ve been tall; it’s true.
But there could have been more, especially among voters of suburban women and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who often don’t vote until they like the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, detailing his claims for sexual assault on the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits in the defendants’ bench. It’s also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford stele and the Kavanaugh witnesses, with the balance leaning slightly toward the last.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents doubtlessly or likely believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent claim to doubtlessly or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or unquestionably lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating claims filed by Ford and, at least, another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the influence of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez denounces that the Supreme Court nominee taught him genitals at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that relies on Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and who can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's occult intention was "to dominate the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify. They're all available in one browser at a time.
What is exclusive of the personal online data store is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates the right resources, processes and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some in-house developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that no one on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether we need to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely hollowed out overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a Saturday post to the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the cleric of the Victory Cross of the I GM
The only clergyman of the Church of England to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons unearthed a memorial tombstone at a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of guns and machine guns".
He later ran towards the line of fire and, with "maximum courage", advanced the line before throwing himself over a cannon with one hand and stunned three members of the detachment.
The lieutenant colonel was shot down by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never match, which produces a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the show and added that the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, saw the Peppa Pig instead
Imagine staying up all night to see Bellator 206 and being denied the most important event.
The San Jose poster contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and were to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for the showdown, viewers in the UK were stunned when the schedule changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted to have spent the night awake until morning to watch the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the change to cartoons as "a kind of vomit joke".
“Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not adequate, so they switched to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communication, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yeah."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But there it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to resolve it until Sunday at our hour, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We tried to show it again by the followers, but it was over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said she didn’t realize until she went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs show, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she talked about gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father had remained important to him to win the Olympic Games.
The long-running show’s regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" others because "he was not socially acceptable like boys and girls."
“To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American director, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "takes me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 older than him, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you go through this when you are young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple were parents in June of a child whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "their whole perspective" has changed.
“If you had asked me that last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold medal,” he said.
“There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he should die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the front row,’” he said.
“As I held his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until then that he was already dead that I finally accepted that he was not invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home at an Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather's Proud Small), which he had heard during preparation for the Olympics and which still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worse Mickelson showed up for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change his physical condition if he is not to become an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourballs" and "foursomes" modalities.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has usually been for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments divides his time between being an animator and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for Le Golf National's difficult career, where the long rough usually punishes deflected blows.
And if his own trajectory isn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson's game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
“He understood his role perfectly for that day, slapped me on the back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It’s a show of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t see him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how I trained and that’s how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
It may mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that has not matched his individual record.
Mickelson has scored 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk has said his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, joking, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great teammate,” he said.
“I think the younger players were also having fun getting laid with him this week, which was fun to see.
It’s a lot more than just his game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advantage may soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the American team, but in the end they won by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a little while," said Bjorn, in the image, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team by 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score at 10-6 at Le Golf.
The story has taught me and all the members of the team that it’s not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go to the full machine.
You have to get out and do everything right.
This does not end until the points are placed on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, to try to win the trophy, and we have to stay focused to do so.
As I said, I focus on the 12 players we have in the team, but I also keep in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted by the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: “I will never rush into this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow’s individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It’s great to be with a partner when everything’s going well, but individual duels put your golfing skills to the ultimate test.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this moment, leave your partner and he must go out and get the best out of himself as well.”
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the last day's raises, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how he motivated Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start off on a good footing, as seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We’ve prepared the lineup based on the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is challenged to begin the rematch against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I chose this order because I think it covers all the possibilities,” Bjorn says of his selection for individual clashes.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The new frigate of the German Navy should have been completed in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but will not do so at least until next year due to faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continued delays imply that the avant-garde ships, which were expected to project Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete by the time they go into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made news last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons for the return, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unusable if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are significant, as approximately 120 sailors, half the crew needed for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to weigh twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Aside from defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, given recent warnings that Germany’s maritime military power is being weakened.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used".
The official said the situation had worsened over time because the old ships were no longer used, but no new ones were provided as spares.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
A new research carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
The findings are expected to provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help with future conservation activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common bats, in addition to northern and water bats in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations of the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
UK National Health Service volunteers and staff will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The sound analysis of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and habitat map will be created to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation advisor at the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
The construction and restoration of buildings threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do paperflies and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo locating technique to locate insects and obstacles that get in the way of their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts with the appropriate training, who carry out surveys, inspections of nests and, sometimes, rescues on a regular basis.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threat Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate's administrator, David Thompson, claims that it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here at Threate, we have a large area for bats,” he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before doing maintenance tasks on properties, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, annoy and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official with the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
“We still have a lot to learn from bats, and in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data on their population.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers prepare suit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said the rape allegations against him are "fake news" and said people "want to become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, which is responsible for publishing the accusations.
The striker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 at the time for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations went public, 33-year-old Ronaldo claimed they were “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," the five-time Golden Ball winner says on camera.
“They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to make themselves famous, but it’s part of my job.
I’m a happy man and everything is in order,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have labeled as "inadmissible information of suspicions about private life," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed with Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except for "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but were consenting.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and was photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of reprisals" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to cancel the deal as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he has signed for Juve, the Italian giant, in a €100 million operation.
Brexit: UK 'would always regret' losing car manufacturers
The UK “would always regret it” if it lost its status as a global leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, it will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with other EU countries will work has aroused fears from other UK carmakers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for car manufacturing.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there may be unrest at the border, which the sector believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to stop as a result.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls.”
"We have to come to an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“Tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would stop, but in the long run, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, said members are starting to be very worried about the situation: "From experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump’s long-awaited meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for a week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues in White House statements on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, Russia’s ties to Trump’s aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump dismisses the deputy attorney general and jeopardizes Mueller’s independence has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump has said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but he postponed the meeting to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the entire Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be one more week late for all matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some reporters may refute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he disliked the bragging of television journalists, although he said, "I will not deny that they are bragging."
He then hinted that there would be more direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without citing any source: "We have consulted these data."
Sanders has said that briefings will continue to take place, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, it is far infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and they’ll replace the briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Individual press releases are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal and, at times, odd appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service following fears of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the UK’s departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of state of residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and everything seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a difficult time for all of you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate that I very much appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Partners in the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting the patients and communities we treat.
“Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, a realignment of the Tennessee State Tigers, has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to reports from Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
“It came to the sideline and it collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him on a bunk bed and taking him away for further testing.
A Tennessee State official has informed Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after signing from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help the homeless according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp tax will be taxed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Hisenda expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to be levied a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK and that money will be used to help homeless people, a move Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will be taxed on those people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will go to government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second homes and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
The company expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are from non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for novice buyers to open up to the property scale.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain’s “real estate disaster.”
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as checks on renting and the completion of eviction "without guilt".
He also wants to give more power to the city councils to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be correct that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the indignity of the homeless makes it all the more real.
Jack Ross: 'My ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman has accepted the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently occupies third place in the League One, three points behind the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me once as a supporter and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching a lot of playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it’s always something that makes me go back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in coaching clubs, though.”
Ross' predecessors as coach of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn't feel the pressure to be next on a list of names on such a large team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my criterion for measuring my success will be whether I can get this team back into the Premier League.
“With the structure and facilities of the club, it is obvious that their place is in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would only consider that I’ve been successful here if I can get the club back.”
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a stint as second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He helped Alloa avoid the descent into the third category and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a decisive moment,” he recalled about accepting the position at Alloa.
“I’ve always believed that coaching was the best thing I could do, more than just play.
It sounds strange because I did it right, I got away with it reasonably and I enjoyed enough good times at algids.
Playing can be very hard.
There are a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I still spend it on things like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the most comfortable time I’ve felt since I was an adult.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heatwave has triggered consumption in Britain’s struggling bars, but added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, CGA's financial advisor, the company that collected the data, says: "Continuous hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has lengthened more than expected, have meant that July continues a pattern similar to that of June, with the increase of 2.8% in restaurants, except in the case of restaurants.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by beverage consumption, have achieved the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
People just want to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6 percent during the month, while food sales have fallen by 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, of RSM hospitality and leisure analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we have been seeing since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to the sales of the external leisure market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% year-on-year would be especially damaging, more so than the continued pressure for costs.
This long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food shops and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide that much-needed respite.”
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, has been 2.7% in July, given the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales indicator for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 million and is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to a recent survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "fake" Insta pages
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a “main” account they show to parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid rise in “fake” Insta accounts, a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
The news has raised fears about posting sexual content.
20% of students say they have a net “main” account that they show to parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a message from a teenage girl urging others to “rape me.”
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Committee of Directors of Private Schools (HMC), has revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years old have two profiles, of which half have admitted that they have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the directive of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation at the organization's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most medal-winning field and track athlete and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of athletes and I look forward to growing the sport and contributing to it in Scotland.”
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular commentator for the BBC, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what degree.
It has been exhausting, but I have recovered completely, I have learned to walk again and today it is time to do agility exercises!
Thanks for the messages of encouragement!"
An ad that compares mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A pulley company has shared opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows that are milking.
To mark the launch of what is considered the “world’s first silent sledgehammer that can be carried,” consumer technology company Elvie has issued an announcement inspired by a music video prank to show the freedom that the new sledgehammer gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of fodder and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I'm joining myself, but you won't see any tails" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not braggars, but my breasts".
The return continues: “Bomb, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, pump, milk the girls”.
However, the announcement, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixture of reactions from those who have seen it, many of which claim to show the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are removed from their babies a few days after giving birth,” one person wrote.

Another person commented: "Understandably traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a sledgehammer for mothers who will keep their babies?”
Another user added, “It’s an out-of-place ad.”
Others defended the ad; one woman admitted that finding the song was "fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Pumping for the pulley made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it should be taken as what it is.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun ad for mothers who are pumping with sacks (usually at their workplace or in the toilet and feel like cows.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the slingshot discreetly placed on the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women feel as if they are cows when they use the sledgehammer.
However, the Elvie pulley is completely silent, has no cable or tube and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women more freedom to move, hold babies and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood developer at Mother, said: “The Elvie slingshot is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
In drawing the parallels between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a sledgehammer is used and the challenges it entails, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new sledgehammer.
This isn’t the first time Elvie has been on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has increased although monthly cross-border admissions have virtually remained stable, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who have been afraid to put their chances of staying in the country at risk if they decided to take in a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective godparents and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to accommodate unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal history.
“About 80 percent of people who have hosted or live in the home of a person they have hosted are in the country illegally, and a vast majority of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we will continue to persecute these people,” Albence said.
To prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than face-to-face, to defend their case to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered eligible for aid will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent rampages or escape attempts, according to workers and reports released by the system in recent months.
Lawyers say these concerns can intensify in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering are more likely to be overlooked due to their size.
They have added that moving children to camp without having time to emotionally prepare them or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish ‘occupying forces’ to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been raging for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the “war of terror is practically over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have purged all Syrian territory” from both terrorist groups and from “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a country hit by war.
On the refugee issue, Muallem said conditions were good for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears" that make refugees want to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats have said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone at the last large rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favoured the opportunity to continue political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russian help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has “clear terms” and expressed hope that military action will confront the jihadists, which include al-Nusra-linked fighters, who “will be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee of members of the government and the opposition to begin to outline a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose work should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the election again in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators probably expect, scandals and the impeachment process end his presidency prematurely.
What would be, without a doubt, “the end of a most dramatic presidency in history.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of prime-time viewers has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak viewing hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“People have been thrown into it because they don’t understand it,” says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series Designated Survivor, about a cabinet decree that happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
“He said that because it made him laugh,” Scovell told me.
There is a point of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go further when you find yourself in the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of sources “for private use” for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar ostrich-skin jacket (“a piece of thick-clothed stuff made him the headline”).
I will never see Super Mario again.
“Part of what makes it appear to be part of a reality show is that it gives you something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the character changes and script twists of Trump’s show (fighting with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house he has on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
It could not be disengaged, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
“I remember when we did those crazy programs back then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it would be some kind of joke, but it looks like they were right.”

External money floods the races of the midterm elections in the House of Representatives tighter
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of the congressional districts that has made two current members have to compete for the same square.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburg involves Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won the place in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who comes into conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the parties’ main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely watched special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have been in office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but withdraws them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions about ceasing to recognize Taiwan," department spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador was contemplated, which in 2017 received US aid of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and high death tolls from murder and unemployment.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking administration officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to happen, effectively ending any likelihood of sanction for the Savior.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to their positions in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, which included two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the basis of anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study History
The next event to occur could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is numerous evidence in public records.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in its election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the body, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European namesakes, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates at turning points like this and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The United States is currently facing several turning points.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water around his neck since the newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Rosenstein claims that the Times’s information is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in the middle of the legislature for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to run into danger.
But I don’t think we’ll fail, because I’ve already learned my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With that in mind, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the match against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw on the Vila-real field this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the Europe League G group.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the 2–2 draw against Vila Real, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Vila-Real is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else out of it at the end, but overall, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
We hope to be able to keep the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we will give everything and get a good result with the support of the fans.
“Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it our all, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women lose sleep for fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to their family about it.
Approximately half of respondents nationwide say they have talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of those surveyed said they had spoken to their children.
“People want some family member to take care of them, but they don’t dare to think about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance company Nationwide.
You have to start here.
Talk to your partner and your children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to decide where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your funding options for your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy of effective value that helps you cover expenses, or your own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the way for legal battles.
Find a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of contracting a notarial power of attorney for your finances.
It is advisable to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of disability.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly family member has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“Finance is not the only factor that has to be determined, but also which doctors you want to deal with,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready.”
Man shot several times with a compressed-air shotgun in Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots from a compressed-air shotgun while returning home after going out at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (in British summer time), as a “random act”.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His life is not in danger from his injuries and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died due to a strong earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities. The death toll is expected to increase.
As communications are cut off, aid units have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake epicentre.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of Celebes Island.
The regency, an administrative region lower than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Celebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami in western Donggala killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt and earthquakes occur there with some frequency.
Below are the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that shattered the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 rocked a populous area of the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the islands of Mentawai, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya’s regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died from the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of large earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia that killed more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she stretched out her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Interim Detention Center, where he is being held with an unsecured obligation of $500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he pleaded "not guilty, with certainty" when asked how he pleaded, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A fouls, meaning he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
She is also charged with a class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with reporting a domestic violence crime, and possession of a weapon in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
His wife said she punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups for associating her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder derived from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are circulated with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Exceptional Death Penalty for New York Terrorist Attack Suspect
New York federal prosecutors are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary sentence that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists during his trip in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could amount to a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with a 22-fault indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's actions as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they told investigators they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also called for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader has said politicians should "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians has suggested she should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when pro-union conservatives have presented themselves in yet another protest against Brexit in La City.
The prime minister is struggling to preserve her Chequers compromise plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, union supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist he will be able to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure the Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between his package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told Solihull’s Leave Means Leave rally that he wanted to undo the Chequers commitment.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we’d be out,” he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we must undo the Chequers’ commitment.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is totally false.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: “I only tell you, Prime Minister, to listen to the people.”
“Chequers’ commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who take to the streets and get us to win an election.
Give up the Chequers commitment and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime ministers keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Farage said rally politicians must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This, now, is a matter of trust between us [the people] and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t allow it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.”
“We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country who gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of activists waved banners about conservatives against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for the frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been the center of speculation about the possibility of removing Trump from office in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the open meeting format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn’t work, and that includes a woman at the top.”
Person Arrested for Shooting Death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims has been arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head that eventually killed him,” police officer Murphy J. Paul told 247 sports media on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a gun, and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team orders hand him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel pitted earlier and let Hamilton run with traffic on the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to pit and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after some wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to abandon the free inner part at the risk of being left out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap was in seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position for much of the race as he retained his wheels to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen and move to fourth position.
He finally entered the pits on lap number 44, but was unable to increase the pace on the following eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It’s a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and it was a real gentleman who was told to let me pass.
The team has done a fantastic job to have a u-two," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she didn’t leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "bad, cruel and liars."
“One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that’s going on in the Senate the last few days, when you see anger, when you see people angry, bad, cruel and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they say, ‘No, it wasn’t me.
It wasn’t me.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... Did you filter the document? "Hey, what?
No, no, no, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we didn’t leak it,” he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s statements, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me to do.”
But his denial did not please the President, who remarked at the Saturday night rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
“You see the evil, the cruelty, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to have power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite loss to the Belfast Giants as they won the 5–3 return match at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately scored a two-goal advantage thanks to the finishes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised their team's level, but Dwyer later restored the Giants' advantage.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalled the Dundee, then two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assist from Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to their level with a powerful 27:37 minute goal.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the match at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from plane crash
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after dying to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers lands safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a large earthquake rocked the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are being produced in the area and many people are trapped among the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his companions escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his seat at the trembling control tower at Palu Mutiara Six Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that the Batik flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take the flight.
He then exited the air traffic control tower when he thought it was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
An Air Navigation, Indonesia representative, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we missed it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It broke my heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, who will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the mini-markets have been looted.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working against the clock to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he said on CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini says a man has now disappeared after the lagoon accident
The airline operating a flight that was going to crash into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although they previously said the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, since Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local craft helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday and they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane docked in the lagoon because the runway was short.
Some witnesses believe that the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
“That was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to walk with water around their waists to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working closely to improve a pier also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to land before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people died in PNG-registered airline accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors concluded the case on Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness for the intelligence analysis field.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to build the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said she received location data from different cell phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting her earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reports.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he had lied, since his van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense plans to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to pass to the jury throughout the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims hip-hop has strayed from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and put conscious hip-hop back into fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom at the hands of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York Nurses Sue Couple for Farewell After ‘Racist’ Message
A New York City housekeeper has sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from her mother protesting that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies they are racist and compares the lawsuit with an “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay at seeing that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK PERSON,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, he sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her pity, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nanny she had dismissed, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the payment corresponding to her working day and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice is demanding compensation from the couple for the dismissal and demands compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month residency work for which she had been hired, although there was no contract.
“I want to show you that you can’t do things like that,” he told the Post on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the claims that they were racist by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid that they could not trust her after having offended her.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to an “extortion,” said his wife had two months to have a baby and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to pursue something like that?”
It’s not a very kind attitude,” the banker added.
The legal case is still unresolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and to condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before having the inspiration to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "sweet bittersweet", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and says that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
“He was a discreet man; he wasn’t a presumptuous one,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when your son achieves something: you take pride, even if it’s not your business.
I think he considered Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, they rushed their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad would call frequently to say that it was very serious and that they did not expect him to get over it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad and he told me he would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs he had been given to keep his body beating were being consumed and coming out of his system.
He had died earlier than planned and so everything went away.
I just had to sit back and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to stay in good shape.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience that was going on.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I had my head bent and my tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her very much.”
Women in mourning hang cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and, at the age of 18, he killed himself.
“I don’t want any father or mother to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, based in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile could light up any room.”
However, he quit his job before dying because he was at a "very dark point."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis stated, “I am continually concerned that there is a side effect.”
Ms. Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people you can turn to, that they can listen to, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
“He never said he wasn’t feeling well or that he was depressed or anything like that,” he said.
“A couple of days before Christmas we saw a change in attitude.
It hit the bottom on Christmas Day, when the children opened their presents and he didn’t look them in the eyes or anything.”
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to work on it: “It opens a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we must continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a scope and a limited time), we could get some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday. He also added that he feared the committee would be destroyed with the stalemate of supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Your reluctance has to do with the moment.
There are only five weeks left for the November 6 midterm elections. If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened in getting the man they want elected to reach the country's top court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the tie and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors 'fall' with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said there had been 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and rising prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
Normally, the vast majority of deserters in the North are offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul sources say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers migrant deserters illegal, rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed broadly to work toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in these circumstances we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and unfit to work in the High Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said High Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and that his temperament incapacitated him from working at the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted this way, she would have been told she’s a ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and being speechless as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats and said the accusations against him amounted to a “grotesque and coordinated assassination of a character” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony demonstrated that he could not work at the High Court, as it showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
“I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi was reluctant when asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if confirmed, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“That’s what I can say: If you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you’re not only not able to be in the High Court, but you’re not able to be in the courtroom where you are now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he evaded questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the High Court.
“It’s not a time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to come into court and hope we find it wonderful,” Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It is a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and cannot be removed without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. And you?"
“I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, telling the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for rabies in part because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a male-majority office, where I once ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of an older woman (a cold directive who had always frightened me a little) who grabbed me from my shoulder and dragged me to the eye of the scale.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll rejoice because they’ll have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me as she laughed 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Somebody said, "Blancaneus and the Seven Dwarfs."
As he was late for the campaign, he was late for fundraising, so he promised that he would not enter the race if he did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give her $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and targeting voters, rather than delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she was left speechless.
“You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” recalled Mrs. Schroeder of the press reaction.
“You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my grave?
"Did you cry?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War May Benefit Beijing
The initial salvos from the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the war does not appear to be ending soon, a detachment of countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts said.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed taxes on China’s top exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of products. These tariffs entail a tax levy on half of all goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Beijing has counterattacked each time in the same way and has recently raised tariffs from five to ten percent for $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to replicate the U.S., and the world’s second-largest economy is not likely to back down anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means giving in to some demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would initiate a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than witnesses had predicted,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria 'prepared' for refugees to return, foreign ministry says
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country, devastated by a seven-year war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
“Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that the terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that financed the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has clinched the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the North American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team again won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the exit shot into the water in the par 3 16 hole, ceding the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his series and became one of the four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was removed with a 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player of the European team Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 race points.
“I don’t cry, but I can’t help it today.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
The team is the most important... And I’m glad I was able to help,” said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the baton to fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games he had in France and now has a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players who have ever existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. national team struggled throughout the weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-profile golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pressed the European team.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
The 12 players played well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and am proud to have been their captain.
He's got to get his hat off.
They have defeated us.”
