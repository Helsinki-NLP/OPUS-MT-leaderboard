This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered with feathers, an already widespread hypothesis, but provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the feather of this animal was brown-brown at the top, with a light or orange color at the bottom.
The discovery also provides insight into how bird feathers have evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed axis, called rickshaw, but have other characteristic elements of feathers – beards and beards – the researchers concluded that rickshaw was probably an evolutionary development arising from the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for impressionation. The researchers suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feather and not chicken fluff.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feather rather than a chick's fluff.
A car that exploded yesterday morning at the Gaziantep police headquarters in Turkey killed two police officers and injured more than 20 people.

Police said they suspect a suspected Daesh militant (ISIL) was responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun works according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system has been shown to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used in combination to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller Rossby's number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic inversions.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces produced between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of aura and is composed of a lot of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African KwaZulu-Natal region.
In an interview, he said the new variant is “very disturbing and worrying because of the very high mortality rate.”
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr Moll said, and at least two were hospital staff.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis appears to be still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at one time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that temperature differences between night and day indicate the probability that they are caves.
“They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is consistent with the hypothesis that they would represent deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushind of the U.S. Geological Survey Astrogeological Team (USGS) and the University of Arizona North Flagstaff.
In France, voting has traditionally been a bit of a technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin and put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating which candidate they chose.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, he leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers confirm that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except for those of duly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to be witnesses at all stages of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, with the observance of clear procedures.

In the other race, the giant slalom finished tenth in the group sitting female, with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind first-comer Claudia Loesch from Australia, and 1:09.02 minutes behind ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four women skiers in a sitting position failed to finish their lap, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to get a place in the competition.
Police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her cell phone and laptop.”
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the charges appeared in front of the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit her, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road was temporarily closed until emergency services pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Sheriff's Court in Edinburgh.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and courts have ruled that publishing photographs can be harmful.
“Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that ‘journalists appear to be playing with fire by posting photos and other information about suspects.’”
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is charged with the prosecution, told reporters it would not comment further until at least the charges were brought.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants drawn on the basis of pre-war borders in the Middle East in 1967.
Other themes addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims to have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years after signing the agreement, while the PA agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
The hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by the foresters, the test being monitored and its effectiveness being assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sports Hunters Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sports Hunters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director for Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation benefited from comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC), made up of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MECI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
“Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported another 34 overheating incidents, which the company said were “not serious.”
The ministry responded, saying Apple’s delay was “really regrettable.”
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held tourists hostage from Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippine state.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and so far the deaths of at least six have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Philippine photographs.
Later, photographs took the place of an elderly woman who needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began in his spare time to investigate premature labor.
His research showed that if a hormone had been administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua said government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
The wrestlers also paid homage to Monday.
“Tommy Dreamer said that <0xC2><0xAB>The Moon was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. The Moon died in the night with two months. A unique moment, as she was. A strong woman.».
“Dustin Runnels, nicknamed ‘Golden Dust,’ commented that ‘The moon was as eccentric as I was...maybe even more...I love it and will miss it...I hope it’s in a better place.’”
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in his view, Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II’s reign comes to an end.
34% of those interviewed agree with this opinion, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim at the Commonwealth Games, in the 100m and 200m freestyles, as well as in three relays, but his physical condition was questioned because of his complaints.
He was unable to take the medication needed to control the pain, which was banned during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
Several people verified the discovery before early February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water for the earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his government earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as representing “political gossip and bullshit.”
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to travel shorter distances, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older ground-based radar systems, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and transmit more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transportation is available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and public transport-related parking and parking facilities are not available in the area.
Fears about the lack of means of transport brought into question the possibility of organizing the party with closed doors, in the absence of team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between Darwin’s endemic cinthes, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus cinthes, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in a multitude of designs. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into thin threads that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated in the form of sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued over other metal. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be prepared using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, form a ball of them.
The moisture present on the hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used in common.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you do it through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket, 100 feet tall, to take a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has given us was to provide us with a much simpler and faster transportation.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them we have several medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free pet cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche; each feline has its own role to play, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called packs.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and chicks.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals with surprisingly similar behavior to lions (but not other large cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not well), swim, jump long distances, and shoot with a force five times greater than that of a strong man.
Tigers fall into the same group (the Panthera genus) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can rage.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the roar of a lion, but rather a proposition of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents or birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to be eaten (prey) with the help of smell, sniffing the ground to find them.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and can move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the environment they are in, then throwing themselves on the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which they come (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river or if they move to a new island, from which they cannot easily return back), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say that they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe in, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale (i.e. they release it from the lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis. In addition, they make shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of his time, having no fear of anything but other mosasaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 blade-sharp teeth, along with an additional set in the mouth sky, meaning that nothing in his way would escape.
We don't know for sure, but he could have had his tongue forked. His food included turtles, large fish, other species of mosasaurians, and he may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex could cope with it.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called apron.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate while sitting in the chair, rich men liked to make banquets in which they lay on one side while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not include foods that arrived in Europe, America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient novel ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of that god.
People sacrificed to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an internal sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of temples, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurates were also built.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard; the shops were just the counters that went straight into the street.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so the wood was very expensive.
In the Scandinavian saga it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while traveling further west, he found Green Earth and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of the discoveries he made, Eskimo tribes already lived in those places at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in population, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence can be read the words: "Original of the Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears overturned, at the bottom of the document."
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is still known that, at its beginning, the large document of parchment (measure 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) had been kept rolled.
Therefore, the marking was probably made simply for labelling.
D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
"It was led by the French "from Vichy". These were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked alongside the invaders instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American forces along with the free French had liberated southern France and headed for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a group of significantly large people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, i.e. civil, being related to the Latin civil, i.e. citizen, and to civitas, i.e. city or city-state; it also defines in a way the size of society.
State cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilizing culture involves the transmission of knowledge over generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations themselves.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to implement its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to overturn laws and tax rates between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and states treated the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, together with the German national football team, is ranked second among the most successful teams in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
There are nearly 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
“Thanks to the island groups that Japan has, it is often said that Japan is, geographically, an ‘archipelago.’”
The beginning of Taiwan took place long ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island, recorded the name as Formosa Island or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1984–95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photo format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
The 35 mm format, somewhat confusing, is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore declared to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism, while maintaining some order in an image.
According to it, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame in thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to it.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to each other, despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power has affected everyone, from king to ordinary mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many wonder whether the principle was really respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, disrupting the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted provisions of international law, enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unbridled submarine war.
In the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with only four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from the previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different periods of time; each stage of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
The period between consecutive dynasties was also marked by the divided provinces. The interval of this kind was best known as the Three Kingdoms Period, over 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were fierce wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to occupy the throne in the grand palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist to a republican, nationalist system, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to be successful.
The same was true of the military, because instead of the class-based armed hierarchy, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things that went beyond the worldly, and he used to go often to meditate in a cave that came to be known as “Hira” on Mount Noor (light).
The cave itself, which has survived over time, allows us to form a living picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know its existence. Once you get inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that have remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza Necropolis, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, is home to several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the highest), several smaller tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, cavities, and temples were built to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
“The ‘feature-up’ marking looks like a V, and the ‘feature-down’ marking looks like a staple or a square that lacks the bottom side.”
Up means you have to start from the top and push the bow; down means you have to start from the frog (i.e. in the part where you grab the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An upward bow feature usually generates a softer sound, while a downward feature is stronger and more determined.
Do not hesitate to signify your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for bow features are there for musical reasons and normally, they must be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se, 11 and Louis-Charles, four) and the king's sister, Madame <0xC3><0x89>lisabeth, were forced by a merchant mob to return from Versailles to Paris.
They moved back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob shouting and screaming threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage's windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd lifted the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen's eyes.
The wartime expenses of U.S. imperialism in conquering the Philippine state were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to bear much of the expenses and interest on bonds put on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history spanning the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a related logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce car ownership costs.
A large number of car owners lead to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for healing personal injury.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is considered the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread through 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silk and spices more cherished than what Byzantium's markets offered.
This was the moment when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, western styles can be 25 to 30 years ago.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advances of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture made to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological, system that uses preserved seeds from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this is still happening in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel set aside by society’s standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
Characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to be inspired in a few unfortunate cases by children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
"Such children are called untamed or savage. Some savage children have been kidnapped by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to rejection by the parents, due to severe intellectual or physical deficiencies."
Wild children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding or construction site method is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little man staple in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are included in the software, serving to interrogate, provide clues, and explain procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in family care for many reasons, ranging from negligence to abuse, to extortion.
There shouldn’t be children who grow up in an environment where they are deprived of food, love and education, but there are.
We see the family care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe accommodation, caring caregivers, solid education and reliable healthcare.
Family care is supposed to cover the needs of children, who were not covered in the house where they had previously been.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of addressing types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continuous relationships” were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it can be observed if a person lies by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his “President’s Speech,” showed how people who can’t understand speech because of brain damage still manage to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination mean that each generation the direction of variation is dominated by one or the other of the two genetic backgrounds.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most affordable plant resources were protein from leaves and legumes, but these are hard to digest for primates like us if not cooked.
In contrast to these, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
“Given all of this, it should come as no surprise to us that our ancestors solved the ‘protein problem’ in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the savannas of our day.”
Sleep disruption is the procedure by which you intentionally wake up during your normal sleep period to fall back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a conscious state without fully waking up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one’s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, to which the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga have been added.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing the different deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process and culture led to the distancing of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last forty years and would be fought seriously, by “delegated” armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans, however, became useless almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army were set in motion creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one side of the oceans to another.
Traditionally, the Navy's role has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples in this regard was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have managed to occupy Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to home in order to have easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing places, usually in the care of goats that were often children or adolescents, similar to well-known sheep.
Wagonway-type roads have been built in England since the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly more irregular roads of that time.
Traverses were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place. However, gradually it was concluded that the rails would be more effective if they had a metal strip above.
This became a widespread practice, but iron led to faster wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; people began walking in an upright position 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning the right man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually walk in an upright position.
Bipedal specialization is found in fossils of 4.2-3.9 million-year-old Australopithecus, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus may have already been bipedal seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to some extent reduce future suffering.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not only want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are now greater because of humanity’s overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten brochure, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press, a few blocks away.
"Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 children were made, known as 'Dunlap posters.'"
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon at Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap posters are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds you can still see many features similar to dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on manipulating encoded information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number may contain only one of the two values, 0 or 1, respectively, and the name of these numbers is binary digits or bits, in computer jargon.
The internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication for internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term “beetle” is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term has its origins in the ancient resemblance to ploshines, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer cockroaches and cheetahs are nest-like, adapted to the life in the nest or the home of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), meaning it is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a child is neither in their interests nor in the interests of the child.
These couples may choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only experiment, however, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have mostly used classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas on all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West awoke separate from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important evidences in favor of the hypothesis that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments marking either the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Organized tourism around nature exploration attracts people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting, photographing and learning more about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from the small settlements of the country to their jobs, passing by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone somehow has to do with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has sustained human evolution over the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or the collapse of bridges are rarely encountered in developed countries.
Why do transport systems give rise to such dissatisfaction, why do they fail every day? Is it because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to remain within reasonably constant limits; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main features: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mates for mating much more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings at the back along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeris.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; namely that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don’t feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles.
Not less than 20 percent of the water that drains into the oceans from the planet’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller waters.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical skill in construction.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known since antiquity some fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper because they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, issued a theory according to which everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air and fire.
It was more reminiscent of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he had theorized and transformed himself into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys may also include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny, that trillions could fit at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer means of writing appeared, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to get their hands on a sharpener.
You can only ask yourself what the fate of the keyboard will be when something new appears.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up the hill. Breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with a small impulse or without impulse.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the bark.
The crust is about 70 km thick in the near part and 100 km in the far part.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker in areas of higher relief.
It may be more maria in the nearby part, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying the elements that attract people’s attention or please them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with development into maturity.
These theories study what causes some people to want to do what they do, and what in their environment can cause certain things to do or not do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Pyramid of Needs and Herzberg's Theory of Two Factors.
Generally, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead ex-colleagues. One extreme is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals who think they need to change everything the team has done and do it in their own style.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to breaks between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
They often have more autonomy than members of the conventional team, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
“The Invisible Team” is the management team to which each of the members report. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each of the members.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When in the functional departments of an organization all available resources are used in an efficient way, creativity and ingenuity can manifest themselves freely.
As a result, the process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to get organizations to achieve higher performance.
Data from neurobiology is physical evidence that underlies a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. As such, it allows narrowing the area of research and defining it with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes that take place in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence to machines.
Research in AI involves manufacturing machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, but a few software applications for personal computers and video games have also been used.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while in class.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also an excellent way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the site is remodeled, and previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve the student’s written expression. While students often start their blogging experience with negligent grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Since student students often represent the most critical audience, the blog author begins to make efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
“Also, blogging ‘forces students to be more aware of the world around them.’ The need to respond to their audience’s interests inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).”
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their study far beyond the usual school day.
Proper use of blogs “can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to material found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others have written, as well as shape their own perspectives on certain issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoilt natural beauty of Muskoka District and more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider Canadian par excellence.
Large portions further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that have the gift to surprise many: the number of African Americans living in the U.S. is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which had great success in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is good to wear a ring, but not to look expensive.
Women should take into account that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and it is not out of the ordinary to be chased, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be resolute when you refuse a man and don’t be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, it still doesn’t mean it’s OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used as a strategic port for Phoenicians, Romans, and sailors, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it as the White House, but abandoned it again in 1755, following an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who had established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tajine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of all kinds of small things, but it’s everything for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the settlement's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a pretty safe place, for out-of-town visits an information effort is required to understand at what stage the fighting is still going on in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest trips in the footsteps of African mountain gorillas.
For the trip through Goma you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price of a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Besides its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used metaphorically with the meaning of exotic, remote places."
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the danger posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special PBS show, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in sharp contrast to the rest of the country’s cities, as it has a more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting another type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the national parks in this country (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily entrance fees and conservation fees for the park.
It could also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a number of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The name of Hong Kong territory is given by the island of Hong Kong and it is the place that many tourists regard as the central point.
The exhibition of buildings contributing to the horizon of Hong Kong has been likened to a diagram of bright bars that is highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the urbanly developed part of Hong Kong Island is cramped on land recovered along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British colonizers have mastered and therefore, for anyone looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps – they also comprise some of the last remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/moor.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has become a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengali tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (over the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses connecting the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby sights such as Paro (150 No.) or Punakha (200 No.).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge, stretching over the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two strips of 3.50 meters wide.
The free height of passage under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the largest group of indigenous people living in what is now Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
"Paraguay, formerly called the Giant Province of the Indians, was born in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors met the indigenous groups."
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n was founded in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous specificity and identity.
Argentina is renowned as having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
Tournaments and smaller matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo games, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is set as the equivalent of 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley face-to-face with the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also accepted frequently.
On the outer islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although they will probably receive the British and American currency; contact the owners early to find out what means of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to change Falkland pounds outside the country, so you need to change them before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures frequently reach above 30<0xC2><0xB0>C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below the freezing point, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no particularly 'rainy' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, respectively 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile it may seem, the bison, the moose, the bear, and almost all other large animals can attack man.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep the right distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so it is good to give them their space.
In addition, be careful that the smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so it would be advisable to avoid foods with a strong smell and keep clean at the campsite.
Apia is the capital of the state of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval confrontation of sad memory in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland lies between two ports. The most famous of these are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches, located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where you can swim safely, and most have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide palette of shops arranged along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can find many French wines, but the New Zealand or Australian ones would go better.
Local tap water is drinkable, but if you are afraid you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino comes full-eyed with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. Fruit juices are piped as price, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near the beaches and near the estuaries of rivers from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be found outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack man. Most sharks scare people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They may also keep your booking if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests must be addressed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp on site, and most of the participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to arrive early to catch a campground close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages is over, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you’re crossing the North Baltic in the winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, as navigating through the ice produces an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
St. Petersburg cruises also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the requirement to obtain a visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent here by customers and the money spent by them. Usually, there are no windows and clocks, and exits can hardly be found.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep the mood and the guests to stay on site.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages from the house. However, drinking affects judgment, and good players know how important it is to stay lucid.
Who will drive to high latitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On frozen and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive like dry asphalt.
During the blizzard, in a very short interval, enough snow may fall to block you.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow or viscolite or condensation, or ice formation on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa’s main tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to the land trips undertaken to see the amazing wild animals of Africa, especially those in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow a good visualization of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you’ll be able to see them better using a binoculars.
“A safari on foot (also called ‘a walk through the bushes,’ ‘a safari hike,’ or ‘on foot’) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or a few days.”
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place in other locations on the territory of Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics.
If you have booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, coronavirus cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, with regular tickets costing around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Many hotels have an iron and a ironing board that you can borrow, even if they do not exist in the room.
If you don’t have an iron at your disposal, or if you don’t like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one at hand.
Be careful not to let the material heat up too much (which can cause contraction or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters differ from each other in efficiency level, and if you’re worried, consider buying water in closed bottles from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with at home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritation, or, in severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person using physical force are generally not considered harmful.
Duty-free shopping offers you in certain places the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers visiting high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The portion between Point Marion and Fairmont exhibits the most challenging traffic conditions along the entire length of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often traversing isolated and unplanned areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose control: steep slopes, narrow strips and dangerous curves predominate.
Speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is all the more important that they be strictly observed.
However, rather bizarrely, the mobile service is much more powerful here than along many other portions of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of the southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruity pastries are common, apples are used throughout the year, and cherries and plums make their appearance in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Often, popular cakes go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, taste what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a food based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be 'dry' or 'liquid' depending on the amount of liquid."
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without other qualifications, however, the term tends to indicate food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of flavored dishes with simplicity, with the predominant tastes of Javanese being peanuts, hot pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavored spices.
Stairs support the rider's legs, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but can pose safety concerns as it is possible that a rider’s legs may remain stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the saddle, but remains with a leg hanging from the ladder, the horse can drag him after him when he chases it. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear heeled riding boots and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow ladder straps to detach from the saddle if pulled back by a fallen rider from the saddle.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley - Chile's most sought-after place for climbing, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of high granite walls and peaks.
Climbers from all parts of the world are continually tracing new routes through the walls with unlimited potential.
Sports that involve snowboarding, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, consisting of sliding down the snow-covered terrain, using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
“Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called ‘ski bumps’ in English, who organize entire holidays around skiing in a certain place.”
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have rock paintings that represent skiers since before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened Australia's first recreational ski club.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called skiing in unmarked areas, touring skiing or hiking on skis.
It is a related activity, but usually does not involve alpine skiing or climbing tours, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrains and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover distances slightly longer than walking – but very rarely you will be able to reach typical cross-country speeds without a heavy backpack at the back, on neat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean going through the procedures of obtaining a visa and passport control repeatedly.
In this sense, the Schengen area is organized in a way like a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to do so at passport checkpoints.
Similarly, those who have a Schengen visa do not need to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen member countries individually, thus saving time, money and documents to obtain.
There is no universal definition of which items produced are antiques. Some tax agencies consider antiques to be goods older than 100 years.
The definition varies depending on geographical location, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Crafts can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced objects.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of income among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many who have other trades.
However, traditionally not all members of the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi population were involved in the large-scale breeding of reindeer, but they lived off fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as burden animals.
Nowadays, many S<0xC3><0xA1>mi have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for S<0xC3><0xA1>pm<0xC3><0xAD>, the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi area.
“Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word ‘gypsy’ is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population.”
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, it may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
An example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and oversimplified way, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
“Extreme weather” is a generic term used for any type of dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and are of many kinds, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as storms, tornadoes, marine thrombus and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be wary of the risks of severe weather affecting the area, as this could upset their travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that can be considered a war zone should have professional training.
A search on the Internet for “hostile environment course” will likely provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address in much more detail all the issues discussed here, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually take between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo a sex-change operation in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for the return trip.
The opening of governments to the possibility of issuing passports on which the sex (X) is not declared or documents updated to match the name and the desired sex is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies as much.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through scanners without affecting their privacy and dignity.
Return currents represent the flow of back to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often to a reef or similar formation.
Thanks to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in several deeper sections and there can form a rapid current to the deep waters.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in the attempt to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to move into a position where you are not caught again, and depending on the skills you have and whether or not someone has seen you, you may want to wait until you are saved.
The shock of returning home manifests faster than the cultural shock (persists less from the honeymoon euphoria), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes encounter particular difficulties in re-adapting to their native culture.
If you had returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost yourself from the customs of the native culture.
When you had just gone abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, being aware that visiting a new country requires a process of adaptation.
The world does not always expect patience and understanding to be necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the whole area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
The noise of tourists and sellers is usually heard all the time. The sound and light show seems to be detached from a book of stories.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The southern region of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsula Mountains unite to give birth to this plateau, then split again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel Range, lie the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m.
In isolated places with no phone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot take the place of a cell phone, because you have to be outside, with an unobstructed view to the satellite, in order to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions that require remote transmission of data and voice.
Your local phone service provider may give you more information about connecting to this service.
An alternative increasingly used by people planning a year off is to combine travel with study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before attending a university, but without jeopardizing their educational path.
In many cases, enrolling in one year of courses abroad can even increase your chances of accessing higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programs.
“Finland is a wonderful place for canoeing. <0xC2><0xAB>The land of a thousand lakes» also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the archipelagos on the coast.”
In archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller craft or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland’s national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is from 1 to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore on trips aboard a ship, you won’t need a separate visa (starting in 2009)
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is by no means close to the sea and the city tour is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is not different from personal fears and dislikes of other things, which manifest themselves in many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is essential when it comes to documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and clear.
The only way to make it pass faster was to be sent as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and here you intervene.
The obvious way to fly to first class or business is to pay a large pile of money for this privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: in general, you can expect that in business class you will pay up to four times the normal economic rate, and in first class up to eleven times more!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts for business class or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, in which context they charge rates according to requirements.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from an inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Christianity-Orthodoxism.
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a busy, developed and modern shopping center, set around an enormous bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers, are equipped with traditional 18th-century red-tile roofs, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
Haldarsv<0xC3><0xAD>k village offers views of the nearby Eysturoy island and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the courtyard of the church, there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons above some tombs.
It is worth spending half an hour walking through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became outside the borders of the country following an enthusiastic review of its splendours, made by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north you can visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place known all over the world for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that, in principle, you visit the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who have survived internment there, and many more who have had family members who have been killed or forced to work there to the death, both Jews and others.
You are asked to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by drawing and scratching on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the panels are made only in Catalan, as this is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport, along with other services.
Periodic metro announcements are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automatic system in different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
"Although it is often just a stereotype that is not in line with reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as well as possible, as someone who is 'bien haut' (well raised). It will help you to cope with much more easily."
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you prove a minimum of politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and altitude levels.
The region also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare wildlife such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, laughter, wild cat and mountain rooster can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women should wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer blankets for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear pants to cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any spices available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word itself, which means you, always begin in capital letters, even within the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility that a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
Pronouncement of Italian words is relatively easy, with most being pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to which you need to pay more attention are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel after them.
Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means drag, while car means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Obviously, those who know a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little bit of Spanish may conclude prematurely that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated today and remain open as museums or educational venues.
Since in their glory period light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in our times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas that have favorable weather conditions.
The sight of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first parties dedicated to the cherry blossom were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy of the Imperial Court.
Plants look nowhere better than in their natural environment, so don’t give in to the temptation to pick even “only one” of them.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting “specimens” will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can easily navigate and buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
“But being in the ‘top tropics’, just a few degrees north of the equator, you’ll have to deal with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when it’s clear, less often).”

For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions relating to this holiday have been adopted by both unbelievers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake, outdoors, to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditionalist churches often hold a Passover vigil on Saturday evening in Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the remoteness of the continent, the mammals were unable to undertake the journey, the result being that the giant tortoise is the main animal grazing in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas during the winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon line.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be, more or less, dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not often a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars as well.
The Japanese culture of work has a stronger hierarchical and more formal character than that with which Westerners are accustomed.
Costumes are the standard clothing in the business environment, and co-workers address each other using their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is an essential element, focusing on group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain superiors’ approval for all decisions they make and are expected to follow superiors’ instructions without discussion.
