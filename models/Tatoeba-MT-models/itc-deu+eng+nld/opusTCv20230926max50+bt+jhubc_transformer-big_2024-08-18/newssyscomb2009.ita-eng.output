The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceptible weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously faltering, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the sub-prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006, however, it loses 5.5%.
Even worse was <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost almost 9% of the vote with 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in post-war Austrian history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the popular, which resulted in early elections.
Still at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage over SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But the voters obviously punished them for sinking the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party’s president, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could already take place on Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely way out of the election result, that is, towards the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the liberals (FP<0xC3><0x96>) even gained 18% in advance and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11% of the vote - but the socio-democrats simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the popular to the collective government, (then the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still united, in 2005 the BZ's part was separated.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics, is obviously playing on this evolution.
The Green Party has also managed to enter the Parliament, but it has fallen slightly, falling from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
If the problem with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally collecting beetles in India could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not resolved, then it would be a certain cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that executive power can hardly meddle in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local one in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era to be sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
Then he can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the High Court then it will be possible to obtain the pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to provide the convicts with “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
At the same time he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed down for many years with India.
Indians admit it too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake,” he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he got a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I got relatively many promises," he just found.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers on oceans and maritime rights issues.
His boss, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, is following his exposition and occasionally adds something.
Dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find petroleum, metal ores and other mineral materials, but also living organisms unknown until now that carry within them the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest seabed on the mainland
Coastal states have begun to lend interest to the underwater territory.
According to the OSN convention, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention, it has an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental shelf.
In a nutshell, continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often beyond 200 nautical miles,” explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a very extensive technical-scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The committee has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations were successful,” Mikulka adds.
The recent success of Australia which has greatly expanded its marine possessions has recorded a worldwide echo.
But New Zealand has also earned us - the seabed surface, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers so roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will be harvested in the future from the seabed, as they promise will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their demands.
They can do so for ten years since the "Montego Bay Convention" was ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends begins the area of the ocean floor that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity.
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondike," says director Mikulka, "with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established."
The Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If it divides it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and little bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it is almost an underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a field rich in polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the division of Macedonia, Rober Sandev, brings with him an artifact to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the Golem awakening.
German special units were present for the release of the hostages.
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but did not intervene.
On the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages seized, we are receiving more and more detailed information.
The German Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior have participated in the rescue operation.
In addition to the army specialists, the GSG9 units, the Federal Aviation Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as the technical institution’s logistics experts were present on site.
As the ministry spokesman said on Monday evening, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
“We didn’t get there fortunately,” a spokesman for the interior ministry said.
The attackers kidnapped on September 19 in southern Egypt a group of travelers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end was kept secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The freedmen, meanwhile, arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not explain the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units are expected to fly with an Airbus of the military aeronautics and arrive Tuesday in Germany.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the US Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones is down.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there had been no majority for the program, with which the chaos in the financial markets should be contained.
In a dramatic action, supporters desperately tried to persuade critics of the heavy $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, incited MPs to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While voting was underway the Dow Jones collapsed by more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors’ concerns was that the state bailout package might have failed.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, collapse again.
Experts now expect more serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters register increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover on travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has increased noticeably - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite a weak outlook, the Germans' desire to travel, according to an investigation, remains strong.
On the bookings for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a turnover increase of 31% compared to the same period of the previous year , as informed on Monday in Berlin the German association for tourism DRV.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK there are increased booking quotas even for the autumn months.
So the surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would have amounted to about 11%, the DRV reported.
Assumption for these results are the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyses the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Included would also be travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, particularly required would be travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly popular travel destinations with the Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locations within Germany.
Above all, all-inclusive travel has a high price, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculable for customers than for an individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for bookings made well in advance or all-inclusive deals, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the year before there would be a turnover surplus again - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip, in comparison to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Hits by Ballermann, beer from one-litre mugs and vip in Dirndln brands.
Debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a bespoke Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, is common to us: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, the photographers already throw themselves against us and take pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends
The two-dollar Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist from Wiesn and actually resident north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress is still limited to this day.
And once you get to the Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only the apron of my Dirndl collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A monkess points out to me that I would have tied my apron in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are busy, behind a widow."
I'm sneaking my bow from the back to the left.
“Okay,” he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which head "To drink to get dressed!" and iron their bare back against an uninvited one.
The guy with exhibitionist inclinations is named Bob, comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a trailing "oooo"..
This tells me, after he got rid of his jar of beer from a liter he had drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a trash can.
Bob is one of those infamous Wildbieslers.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 in the evening, the sanitaries walk in packs on the square of the party, who must take care of the poor beons
Nurses appear in packs every time – always 4 at a time drag a tent-covered stretcher into the tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you return full.
Who lies under the tarpaulin in this blood alcohol coffin, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," one of the toilets yells at me and disappears into the baraonda.
Victim of an accident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died shortly thereafter.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on charges of inattentive driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is broadening diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the finest relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
This is at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building stands on horseback between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building slightly decayed.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the westernmost passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retard to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and dominating forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly gone into disarray, largely overtaken by history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-growing diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
There is now a new policy of engagement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning – about ten and a half hours later – after a swaying race along the tracks that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital – proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel – built ad hoc – in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping malls and power confectioneries, where managers in business suits – both men and women – meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Full, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
“The foreign policy party’s goal now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it must look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for one or the other.
It's got to be both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
“Turkey,” he says, “doesn’t want where to face that choice.”
Then he underlines a point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has acted by heart: the ties of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those rail lines eastward through Asia and into the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle East ambitions can now largely be in Turkey's hands.
And as I wait at the ferry terminal that takes me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should make claims on this fascinating country.
Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford Music Director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11) had in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under 21/ under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang their final in 1979, many of us were more than 20 years old - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face everything the music presented to do, both madrigals and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often staggering, always exciting, and it was all because of that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often we were told by Tod to “let music speak for itself.”
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!”
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever the musical standard was, it was raising it more and more.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a conductor as a knight, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have watched more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with just one of them – and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply “rided around the world one or two well-known horses of battle.”
He will be missed by so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman ... studying at the same time for a degree in science, a degree in literature and a PhD."
This follows from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, we don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They attracted my attention for the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments.”
Second Assault on Honda Supersales
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
In addition, it has a refined mechanics, which increases the comfort of driving and allows to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before we go on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the entry into the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less well known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Almost one million Jazz units have been sold in Japan since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers of the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 Jazz units within a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the drop in sales in Spain by a good measure.
In fact, the company’s managers expect to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of sales of the Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the company’s presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the habitable interior is also expanded.
This advantage derives on the one hand from the introduction of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with a double backdrop – rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of commercialization, this small model will be proposed in the models with petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower fuel consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time maintain high engine torque in all its phases.
The 1.2-litre model offers a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now there are 100 available.
The 100-horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by taking the flight of bees for example, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, or the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an expansion of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturer.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to Nissan’s safety shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of bees, able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers developed what they called a laser range finder.
This mechanism detects obstacles in front of the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately prevents collision.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at right angles or greater to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, or even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can turn and not exploiting infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device just needs to process the information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megas.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to his destination avoiding the obstacles present in the route.
Tremble before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not devoid of ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from committing to junk mortgages in dubious insolvency banks, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credits"... or problems.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to induce you to think not once, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not very detailed.
It’s more of a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if the game is completed?
Well, there's a songo room inside the hotel.
It is still something, because to buy a better house does not even speak...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has signed an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, to invest $9 billion in a 21 percent stake in the Company, following a sharp decline in its stock market shares.
A week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or an amount equal to three billion dollars.
The established price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars per share, that is a percentage lower than its current rate of 28%.
By 5 p.m., Morgan Stanley was down 6.79% to $23.07.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition into a bank holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to differentiate its actions by nevertheless passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than the one taken before.
The terms defined on Monday also show that in recent days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of $8.5 billion.
A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained: “We thought that our shareholding would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimise risks and protect ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their book value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter are traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or at about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital contributed by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide details about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is therefore expected to establish a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" lightened its budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to the test, which saw the value of its shares halved while the cost of insurance against risks suffered a surge.
Cost that reflowed on Monday, however, maintaining a high level, around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” among Wall Street’s major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
To found the republic on a socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to the official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% blank.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, it would have to get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polls and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa claimed the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously," he said, congratulating Ecuadorians in the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The poll, which was conducted calmly according to the Organization of American States (OAS) election observation mission, was based on a 444-point text to consolidate the “new socialism” defended by the president.
This draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country that essentially lives on the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants greater power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive terms of four years, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to re-propose its candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the gratuity of health and education services, which the president began promoting in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive in the desert for ten days were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon, safe and sound.
In the morning, they were freed in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base near Cairo International Airport at around 3:30 p.m. on board a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to give any interviews to the press, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They enjoy “good health” and no ransom was paid “to the kidnappers,” Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the airstrip.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from hideout to hideout by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptus, the agency that organized the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight, just before dawn.
“There were gunshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled,” said the official who requested anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flash" unit were sent to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos would support them.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces from Belgrade.
We must admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, of the special forces,” he said, without adding further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle in which the kidnappers were, killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers were linked to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), an assertion immediately denied by the latter.
The Silent Majority of Culture
On the front page a debate on the financing of culture on which the current election campaign is focused.
All the better.
But a part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will speak out to denounce the meager sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic places that starve?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every governmental department, and all this by common accord.
In Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers from the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, grouped into 211 societies for the preservation of historical heritage, genealogical, archives and heritage assets, preserve private archives and archaeological sites for four dollars.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping through partial nationalisation the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which ended up in difficulty first in Europe because of the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interests also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level over the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties the international financial market has been facing for more than a year is that of Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can set a precedent.
Under the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold nearly half (49%) of the bank’s share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week, Fortis’ actions began with a vertical collapse, with serious signs of crisis emerging in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares fell nearly 12% on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current stock prices the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank's executives this value is not real.
The company blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday, the title slowly rebounded.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed the new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers but so far no one has come up with a deserving offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they should not be afraid of losing money.
Among the bank’s customers there was no panic, the branches were not assaulted.
In Hungary Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurers, based on people’s medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting the chicken coop to the fox,” the Washington Post quoted Richard Dick as citing the program’s author to follow prescriptions for drugs.
Insurance companies subordinate the insurance rate and the amount due in case of claims to the state of health of the possible customer and if they consider the risk too high they do not take out the insurance.
A long time ago the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was concluded only after the result of the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer's identification code you can easily get information from pharmacies about what medicines he has purchased in the last year and a half and from this the program shows which diseases he suffers and in what health condition he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in your blood is practically incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
There are various versions of the program on the market, some also determine the risk multiplier, so in addition to paper work there is not much left to the insurer, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the cons is that some medicines are usable for several purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance-commercial point of view, applies as a risk-increasing factor, the first two do not.
For the request and processing of data, separate companies have been formed and, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, they request the approval of the patient.
Now the authorities are forcing them to do so even though they have so far not imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies have also recently been processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to the data and at the same time the control of the use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law, but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities supervisory competence to companies specializing in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that connects the forwarding of data with the express approval of the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the hens are entrusted to the fox's clemency.
Global Marseille menu
EU and India double trade
Given that the European Union and India are partners who trade mainly with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit meeting has also been dominated by this theme, in addition to all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is becoming a great democratic power that should be given more voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So there was no insistence on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Commission, and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade in five years, that is to say to increase trade to 100 billion euros.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods rose from $25 billion to $55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also take off in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India's top trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate programme, i.e. it wants to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that a global pact should be reached at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb rising food prices and have supported convening an international meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital where in a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that to build the Indian nuclear reactors, French companies will receive a contract worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our news agency, the deal would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary to the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be institutionally present with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The meeting with the press at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse will follow: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors progressively decreases on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children.
Steve Fossett's plane found missing billionaire a year ago
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-metre high plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: “The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it’s the one Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was presumed dead in February.
The U.S. Office of Transportation Security (NTSB) said that a few hours after the sighting of the wreckage, a team of investigators had been dispatched, who later identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which had been missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s belongings were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour in a hot air balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had traveled the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among his many records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An out-of-the-box SUV with an original and well-defined design with sharp lines, wide surfaces and sharp corners.
It is this, in summary, Glk the latest born among the "compact" offroaders of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of news in this area.
Precisely for its contents outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17 will be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus the hype that will accompany the debut of the new car will start a new mode of communication also through a futuristic campaign of 3D posters, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-posters, divided into three different phases, that will dominate the central Milanese shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car escapes from the manifesto.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, then recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new in the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to pique the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Azzurra National Team for years and that until now, in truth, had never created excessive problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with the opposing fans.
The group draw is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added clusters (few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the cities of origin of the militants appear: Saturday evening they were removed so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a fan base of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, therefore easily controllable.
And in fact the Viminale had checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium offenses, had been refused the ticket and prevented from leaving.
Now the Viminale waits to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Oh, thankfully.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others should be added.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say from the Viminale.
So, "eyes wide open especially in view of Wednesday's National game in Lecce".
In fact, in Puglia there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deals with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm stretched during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks ago director of the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been quaestor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to entrust the Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the event takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see well what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s hymn: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me I am not an education ...”
