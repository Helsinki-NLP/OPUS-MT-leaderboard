Members of the Assembly of Wales worried about “passing as puppets”
Welsh elected officials are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposed amendment to the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be ridiculed.
One Labour official said his group is concerned that the acronym “rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For non-Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crap.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (puppet), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the English letter u of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the name change, said that "the final decision on the naming of the members of the Assembly rests with them".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the question of the title of the members, the Commission leans in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Welsh people prefer MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could be a real headache for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on the change of name in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the name issue during the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on the change of the country's name
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that the name of Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly vetoed its neighbour's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: troubled churches, bells of St. Martin silenced
“The older people I talked to say that traditionally, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams says.
“There’s no more of them at all today.”
According to him, it is normal that the bars have become scarce.
Today, “we don’t date in the same way anymore,” he explains.
“We used to go to the bar like a neighbor, but that’s not the case anymore.”
As for churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted long before what the officials imagine, and this worries him: "sooner or later, they will return to the starting point".
He adds that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will largely be whites who will hasten the closure of all churches, as it is unlikely that they will become members,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation abandoned the site in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which was preaching nearby, took possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black community under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which blacks struggled to get employed or to get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new chime.
Father Johnson’s son and successor in charge of St. Martin’s Church, Rev. David Johnson, proudly called the “poor people’s bells.”
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
She also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took his place in front of the largest carillon of Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, much has been said about the upheaval of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay leaders, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter would impose the costs incurred, even if it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners lamented the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-year-old boy injured by shark at lobster fishing party
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while he was fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego television channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and started paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought the boy was shouting for joy at having a catch, then he realized that in reality he was
had been bitten.
Upon approaching the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the collarbone.
“I was screaming for everyone to get out of the water: There’s a shark!” says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of the shark at the origin of the attack is not known.
At a news conference, Chief Rescue Officer Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the UK aesthetics market
Sainsbury's handmade bass on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and garnishes them with supermarket-like shelves, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion British aesthetics market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home goods are falling, more extensive beauty product shelves will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves conclusive.
Supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to reuse space formerly occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees ranges will also have more space in areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
Fragrance Shop will also test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket executives need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly tending to shop online and head to convenience stores for everyday food products.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has helped boost sales of everyday consumer goods and make acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempts to restructure the pharmaceutical and cosmetics department of the British chain had ended in failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended a controversy over the distribution of profits from pharmacies in supermarkets.
It was after selling its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of premium skincare brands to four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of the beauty products shelves has been modified to improve the customer environment.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer sound advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any type of need and, thanks to the beautification of our shelves and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance in the cosmetics market is now undeniable and changes purchasing habits,” added Mr. Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger over Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Anger from Dragon's Den TV star Peter Jones after announces host Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her home decor brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the Truly home decor and accessories brand.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she is retiring.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their successful textile and interior design business at the last minute to focus on his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the beloved TV child revealed, during a tense meeting at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den star's commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million contracts would no longer allow him to take care of Truly, their brand of interior decoration and accessories.
The Truly brand was likened to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the animator's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped on her private jet to join one of her second homes outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's top priorities.
and is about to secure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could have imagined what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is filled with ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, which is among the most “bankable” celebrities in Britain, could cause the company to lose millions, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
This could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones held 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was hot, but we finally adore each other
Trump scoffed at the media criticizing him for his comment that some say is “unworthy of a president,” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He laughed, taking the voice of a TV reporter.
“I didn’t give up anything at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un was in favor of holding a second meeting after Trump called the first meeting, which took place in Singapore in June, a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's head of diplomacy Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure exerted.
In his rally speech, Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“Everything is going well with North Korea,” he said.
We have come close to the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have a great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of U.S. military personnel returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crumbling arena, there are barely more than 200 standing in front of me,” he said, pointing to the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of dead in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, help from foreign NGOs was supposedly not necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok was dispersed, but no state of national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
"Unfortunately, many times they have made it clear that they do not want international aid, which complicates things a bit," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether fieldwork will be allowed.
The spokesman for the national disaster management agency, Mr. Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant jolts, the country is sorely lacking in the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm siren sounded in Palu, possibly contributing to the loss of life.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not a simple thing.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed dilapidated infrastructure reform at the centre of his election campaign and has spent considerable money to restore roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, has undermined Joko's government, which is expected to stand in front of voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure due to the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative manner.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes, amid clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge manages to equalize against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a loss to Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led 1-0.
He shoots in the ball on his left, before escaping a shot towards the second post.
The balloon flew above the repair surface before heading towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended its journey at the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to place myself, to take the ball, but players like Shaq always shoot as far as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching to control and without really thinking much I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward kicked a pass to Mateo Kovacic, before rushing to midfield and sprinting to Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick come and go in midfield,
Then he made a magnificent deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard passed the defense and finished his run in the second-post net, with a shot from the left foot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Neapolitans in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: tsunami casualties rise to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the toll of the earthquake and tsunami reported 832 deaths.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves 6 meters high, Sutopo news agency spokesman Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was dotted with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Stabbing Woman
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
At 07:55, the 44-year-old stabbed woman was discovered on John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police are urging residents of the neighborhood who have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statements: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead and who would have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I call on taxi drivers, who could have caught something on their dashcam, and ask them to provide us with any information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found on a property in Birkenhead where she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman came to the crime scene and asked about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they were informing the relatives close to the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his Grayson Mews apartment, with police not allowing anyone to enter or exit the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene,
He said, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several officers were guarding the building on the inside of the cordon.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, to call 101 or to anonymously contact <0xC3><0x89>chec au crime at 0800 555 111, indicating the record 247 of September 30.
Parliament: Cromwell statue the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of innumerable religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its puritanical supporters, such as the fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society found Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it a "revisionist attempt."
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that, "Given the current debate around the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's statue erected in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell did not command or conduct iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is probable that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the preceding century.
Cromwell’s superb representation, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration he had for himself in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than he is today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean the monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated.”
China: Pig kills herdsman
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeast China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery severed and covered in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to have traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby pig house was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer’s cousin, said that “his legs were crushed and covered in blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig at the origin of Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to either the farmer or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the animal was locked up to prevent any further incidents and allow police to gather evidence.
The family of the farmer Mr. Yuan and the market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, attacks by pigs on people have already been reported.
In 2016, on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously injuring him.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig stuck a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to keep him away.
In 2012, when an Oregon farmer had just been eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that he was not an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They are rather playful animals,
Very curious kids... they have no intention of harming you.
It is enough to show them the respect that is due to them,” he assures.
Hurricane Rosa Remains Expected to Cause Heavy Rainfall in Southeastern U.S.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northeast coast.
However, Rosa will cause showers in northeastern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Winds were blowing at 135 km/h (category 1 hurricane) from 5 a.m. EDT on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows eastwards, toward the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Baja California Peninsula in the form of a storm on Monday, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the north, in the southwestern United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the Southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Rainfall will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in areas of the southwest, including much of Arizona.
Scattered tropical rains can cause sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms will produce gusts of wind and dust swirls in places.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rains in some southern parts of the country, on the California coast.
Rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could result in weak debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
This could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical showers will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall across the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer from considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other northeastern regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the season average.
The multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first fortnight of October.
Brett Kavanaugh trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on 6 television channels Thursday, the startling hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accuses her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political stalemate persists, broadcasters interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a theatrical coup: an agreement devised by Jeff Flake, the Arizona Senator, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford said she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had engaged in touching her person and had attempted to remove her clothes during an evening among high school students.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, claimed to be also 100% sure that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels broadcasting the lawsuit, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen does not always manage to estimate the number of people watching TV in the office.
By way of comparison, the trial has attracted as many people as a football game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most watched channel during the day of the auditions, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC ranked second with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million) followed, according to Nielsen.
Interest did not wane once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing out on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is sidelined by protesters as he tries to take the elevator to the court commission hearing.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN broadcast the footage of the arrest live.
“Don’t look elsewhere, look at me,” one of the women said.
“Do you really believe that he is telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are in need.”
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office had issued a statement and he would say more at the board meeting.
All cable and broadcast networks covered the session live a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's Senate-wide appointment.
Flake said, however, that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the charges against the candidate, which the minority Democrats demanded.
Flake let himself be convinced in part by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators afterwards.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance, as the Republicans would not have obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of “small politics”
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union, to do “little politics” at the expense of Britain’s future and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May on the cover, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the free trade proposal between Britain and the European Union was “properly ridiculous”.
Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, was caught and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the scene of the crime, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's office released a preliminary report Friday, which determines that the death was caused by a bullet wound that pierced the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the forensic laboratory of the state police, the police of Southern University, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “commitment and quest for justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m by 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “devastated and in shock” after news of Wayde’s death.
“We fear this kind of event all the time,” Wade said.
Mexico: a volcano spits from the ashes
From the ash escaping from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Reduction recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after recording a spike in activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored several rumbles and tremors from the Popocatepetl.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake of a magnitude of 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being pushed back by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not deplete tourists.
Strikings also broke out later in the day, while police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “neither forget nor forgive,” faced unionist supporters shouting “long live Spain.”
14 protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
One year after the October 1 referendum, deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favor of separation, tensions remain high in the pro-independence region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with opponents of secession largely boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
This one was still in place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was participating with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
“We witnessed a great moment last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in a deadlock,” he laments.
Despite their capital, albeit thin, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for organising the referendum and declaring Catalonia’s independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the demonstration of support for the police on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on both sides.
“The tension is only rising,” he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison pending a judgment since last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,” he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit a house in a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly raiding a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also reportedly shot with arrows.
Livingston wins game 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's victory
Recently promoted, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 games on Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to be placed 2nd in the standings, on par with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of away wins in the Premiership league this season, and face the Hearts team on Sunday, which leads by 8 points.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Viennese Rapid at the Europa League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it extends its undefeated course in the division by 6 games, and its head coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, can boast that he hasn’t lost a single game yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of dumbfounded opponents
Holt's team could have taken a lead well before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to break through but remained stuck in front of the opponent's goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a lead by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team allowed the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that it could hinder them through elaborate tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to grab Menga, who took a touch and scored a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves facing an impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half had the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman from striking, while Lithgow managed to foil one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston goalkeeper rebuffed all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were turned down by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation of Glenn Middleton and the other for a foul of hand.
Livingston's "phenomenon" - Analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Amazing performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and team composition has hardly changed since returning to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for having motivated a team since his arrival.
which has a lot of great players.
Captain Halkett’s defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed one last chance and only managed to pierce the opposing side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the board.
President Erdogan's mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the final day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues were discussed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
On security grounds, police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of mostly Kurdish anti-Erdogan protesters have spoken out, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to his country.
The cleavage that emerges from the protests reflects Erdogan’s double vision: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and described as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at about 10:15 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescue arrived at the scene, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after a cyclist died on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday. The motorist had fled.
London police said officers were making every effort to identify the individual and warn his or her loved ones.
Roads have been closed and bus diversions have been set up, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 Officers Injured in Riot
The head of the high-security men's prison said six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot began in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and is still not under control.
Specialist riot agents were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a wing of the prison.
On the spot, officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison’s management said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will have to answer to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered to be the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners attacked the staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by flash floods (which could be beneficial to drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that is likely to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading to the southwestern desert with what is left of its energy. This region could be hit by flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with foreshadowing rains starting Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have retained the depression or tropical storm stage within a 300km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm of rainfall, and up to 15 cm in places in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa rains could be life-saving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of flash flooding.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40% of Arizona experiences at least one extreme category drought, the second most serious category,” reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey on the coast of the Baja California Peninsula.
Still powerful on Sunday morning and generating winds of up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm encounters the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane on Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Baja California northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, crossing Arizona and southern Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
“Torrential rains are expected in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert and constitute the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These precipitations are estimated to result in potentially deadly flash floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted homicide after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 4am local time.
He was sent to the hospital. His condition is currently stable.
Police in Avon and Sommerset said they arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) overnight on the side of Radstock.
Officers made a call to people who may have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh was a victim of Democrats’ wickedness and anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous methods,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had fallen victim to the wickedness and anger of Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke to Congress Thursday, poignantly and emotionally rejecting allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses her of sexually assaulting her decades ago as teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” on this day.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished jurists, with a brilliant career in public service,” he told crowds of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first decisive procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a statement from a Republican aide to CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds, death toll continues to rise
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had been killed, most of them driven by huge waves that hit the beaches as an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when six-metre-high waves overwhelmed the beach at nightfall, taking many lives and destroying everything in their path.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake preceded the tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t happen alone, it drove cars, wood chips, homes, it took everything with it,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial footage released by the disaster management agency shows buildings and shops destroyed, bridges deformed and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s earthquake was 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of ruined buildings, he added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said human and material losses could be higher on the 300km coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the earthquake’s epicenter.
Communications were “completely paralyzed” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could very well get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to release information that a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the floor of a building screaming frantically at passers-by on the street as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun delivering aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but those evacuated are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened as part of rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia: The toll of tsunami victims is increasing, with more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
Donggala’s World Vision staff arrived safely in Palu, where they found refuge in tarpaulin shelters set up in the backyard of their offices, and on the way they discovered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When relief groups began to help the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that is not yet the case.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting.”
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing people still hoped for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days, near her mother's body.
Indonesian paragliding national team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Others of his students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi added.
“As an alumnus in the discipline of paragliding, I experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were attending the festival on the beach.
His messages remained unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
At Newport on the Levee, thieves steal $26,750 when reloading a vending machine
Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was reloading an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police service.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a dispenser in the entertainment complex and preparing to power it, inspector Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the vending machine.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leave the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, “Formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used the nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made the change just before heading to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled his visit for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current pseudo-professional, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us.
I went from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the hyphen and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO declares that it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire at a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly student allowances and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of education opportunities are pushing young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States is expected to double its dedicated funding for research in this sector, according to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made announcements about AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are one step ahead of the U.S., and we’re looking for the next big discovery in AI,” says Lee.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of AI will come from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, then joined the leadership team of Microsoft Reasearch and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has previously participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that appropriates academic leaders, it’s companies,” says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited big academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers,” he says.
China’s State Affairs Council unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve partners from industry and the academy, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, meanwhile, is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation that works to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has taken no action for several months.
Macedonians Participate in Referendum on Name of Country
On Sunday, Macedonians made their voices heard in a referendum on changing their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, of which one province is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum turnout of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The referendum question was: “Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which has survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union, which means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that mobilized 66% of registered voters at the end of the election.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the name change, in order to open the voice to NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In parliament, in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small stage and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to get into the EU and NATO, but we want to get in through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, joining NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
“I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after submitting his ballot.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll released Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected turnout.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of participants intending to vote said they would vote “yes”.
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50% of the votes plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton’s defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 match on Saturday at Manchester’s Etihad Stadium.
Aguero's goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentinian goalkeeper received the ball in the middle of the field, at the start of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed one defender before ousting the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took the opportunity to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton goaltender Mathew Ryan with a shot from the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the team’s coach, told reporters.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who had given the initial advantage to the Skyblues during the Premier League match,
from the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton field.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second post.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before slipping out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the trouble-party against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-offs, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of a playoff game for the Rockies, true legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking to secure their first division title.
"Even if this game is not at stake, we want to step on the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and facing a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a pitcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to give way to Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th start, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 points average and 300 draws on catches in 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation generated by his support for Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's a major issue. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I fight on all fronts for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see it over the last four days,” he added, before calling the Democrats “angry, nasty and lying.”
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused him to be harassed by the public.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you divulge the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm expecting one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it once was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from my local party's Momentum movement voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs deemed unwelcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she rose up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said, “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
This is exactly what the Friday night general assemblies were like during my eight years as a Labour Party parliamentarian.
Unfortunately, this is not the case today with many gatherings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if it has ever been taken into consideration.
It has become apparent that opposing views are no longer tolerated within the party; each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy came to power, and the colleagues with whom I thought I would share the same political vision began to expect me to turn my jacket around and take positions against my beliefs, whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive tirade on social media, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were addressed to me were political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a surge of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current politics is the normalization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is restricted as the motions of no-confidence and the changes in the selection rules go on.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years: lowering my eyes, not expressing my ideas so loudly, and everything would be fine.
But it's not to act like this that I'm doing politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy because the neglect of Thatcher's government had caused my classroom to collapse, and since then I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councilor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with current party officials.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and utilities. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes I defend, which are your interests at all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains undefeated
Two late tries may have falsified the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense match day of the Scottish Rugby Championship at XV.
The team is now at the top of the standings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized of the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can welcome this match.
“So far we have been tested, but we remain undefeated, so I have to feel happy!” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they were more efficient than us and were able to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute rehearsal, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish squad Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak out. Jason Baggot took over an untransformed rehearsal.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the half. He scored and transformed a solo try to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr in the break.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s trial, transformed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher. During the recovery, Ayr took the lead with a rehearsal of Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr’s acting captain, then received a yellow card and again Melrose tried her luck with an untransformed trial of Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Climo while he didn't have the ball, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's maul, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the practice, as almost every time since rebounding, after Kyle Rowe rounded up David Armstrong’s box kick and sent forward Gregor Henry away for the team’s fifth home practice.
The Still Game star goes into catering
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in catering. The actor was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-hosts with his longtime partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's finale, and Kiernan appears to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “blooming restaurant scene” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in an armored boat in the Naval Headquarters La Paz.
Public buildings carry a flag as blue as the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: "The sea is rightfully ours.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout blocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still present, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of the Bolivian request. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision to be made Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will rule in favor of Chile, and that little would change, even if a positive decision were made.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments show that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have even hurt it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined all of Chile’s remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very complicated to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision-making was abnormally quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also disputed the fact that Morales - who remains to this day one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would not get rid of its nuclear weapons until it had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honor promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to revive nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s current leader.
Ri says it is "chimerical" to think that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that will end the Korean War will make the North bend.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of significant prior disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness about giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows reveal the latest trends in headgear, perhaps soon available in your stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself 100% from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of delirious oversize hats at a PE19 show that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Hats all more extravagant than each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delusional pieces into the shows.
Valentino's flagship piece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a wide feather-like edge, which engulfed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons adorned with jewelry, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple. But these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had sewn lips and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than Haute-Couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment, with snorkels and goggles, while another resembled a melted ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you are in luck.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come all the way to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow in the wake of the "Bomba", the broad-edged straw hat that the stars pull off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard-wearing hat that flooded social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as large as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a handful of white leather, was the centerpiece of Jacquemus’s PE19 La Riviera fashion show at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big beach hats and bags coming to the stores next summer. The designer has so impressed the minds that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the world’s citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with excellent new exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector able to design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries.
If you look at the excellent exam results this year, you can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade, A.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72% of students obtained the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as did the 72% of students who studied German, the 69% of students who studied French and the 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and youth in the future.
Languages as subjects are now organized as are science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job openings requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of their career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this sustainable skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of their competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them did not have enough fluency in a foreign language to have a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, especially those of emerging economies, children will benefit from better chances of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the run-up to 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be accessible in independent schools, with specialized staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is clear that at present, in a global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the country's future, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Saturday.
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to LeBron James' debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in the pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a limited few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump's Campaign in West Virginia (YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stops, including in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the vote to confirm the vacancy on the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is seeking to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia taking place tonight and how do you watch him online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of the hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed for up to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans gain ground ahead of the November elections.
According to Reuters, the president said in his campaign that the five meetings were intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is such an essential part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of this busy election campaign,” a spokesman for the Trump team told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight’s meeting, scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, could gather supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw media attention from Pittsburgh.”
On Saturday, it will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Republican West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to get him back in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team ready to fight for hope ahead of Sunday's singles
After three singles, the Saturday afternoon foursomes could well represent what was missing at this Ryder Cup.
The momentum swing movement is a sporting concept invented from the ground up but which players sincerely believe in, and more than ever before in tournaments like this one.
So where would they put the momentum now?
“They were leading six points ahead and now four, so that gives us a bit of wings,” Spieth said as he was leaving for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a little windy and have every reason to be encouraged, notably by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can boast that they each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has proven terribly effective from tee to green and sets the example.
The energetic cheers intensified as his game progressed, a crucial putt allowed him to equalize in the fourth half while Thomas and he were led two downs after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game in the 15th hole, has aroused a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team still in the running.
“You really have to stay determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as Ryder Cup history attests.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four games and is not entitled to the mistake.
Not only were “Moliwood” the only ones not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the raving crowd designate them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European victory as the sun sets on the National Golf.
Preferably, the two at the same time with different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated morning fourball hero Sergio Garcia as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they could never get out of.
On Sundays, no one is there to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the tips they give and the ones they don’t give, and how a strategy can flip in the blink of an eye.
Europe have played better as a team so far and have taken a considerable lead over the last day, but this foursome session has also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially at home.
Europe leads 10-6 on final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a solid advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning it 10-6 over the United States in Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a distressed Tiger Woods, allowing them to score four points so far.
Determined to keep the title she lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by winning 3-1 in the morning fourballs against a disorderly American team.
The United States showed greater resistance in the foursomes and won two victories, but they failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must score eight points out of 12 on Sunday in the singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, dubbed “Molliwood” after a smashing weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they flatly beat the pair of American rookie Bryson Dechambeau and an already tired Woods by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through Saturday's two games, shone a few times, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world rankings, respectively.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, in a cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 win against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, as they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a team recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, still had to draw to keep their trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they might not recover from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says that disarmament can under no circumstances be achieved unilaterally without trust.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that maintaining the sanctions heightened his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under the circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the world body, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
In the absence of trust in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we will be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While reiterating North Korea's well-known reproaches about Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work toward a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused requests to ease harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea first proceed with denuclearization and increases pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the "declaration of the end of the war".
“Those who think these sanctions can make us use them don’t know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our distrust.”
Ri made no comment about the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted before the United Nations by the US leader earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party involved in the issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a deadlock.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North American territory after “evil” President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened last year before the United Nations to "totally destroy" North Korea, did not suffocate this year's praise for the courage with which Kim has applied disarmament measures, but added that much remains to be done and that sanctions will not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said no deadline had been set. “It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council last Thursday that “the implementation of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until complete, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made but, in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim is demanding the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University introduced a new course that allows all undergraduates to get more sleep and fights the growing macho trend of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
A professor has noticed that most students at the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is according to him the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him.
At the end, a student approached me and said, "Why do I get told that only in the last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
First delivered this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general manager of the university's health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The class time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know this won’t instantly change student behavior.
However, in our view, they have a right to know this information – in the same way that you have a right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride in “sleeping a night out” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Getting enough good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said — even to avoid gaining weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, making them permanently hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and prompted him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar degree program before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm for both bedtime and wake-up time, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another hard blow outside, as Dolly Menga's attack led Steven Gerrard's disjointed team at Livingston to a 1-0 loss.
The Ibrox team hoped to record their first on-the-go win since their 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team dealt Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as coach, leaving his team adrift, eight points behind the Ladbroke Premiership-leading Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, just behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury from throwing an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, picked the same Livi 11 who snatched a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team suffocating his opponents every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman over Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his defending teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second post.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received a penalty after the free kick when he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers had only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike from Oviedo Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs’ stopped kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard reacted in the half by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the trade almost had an immediate impact when the winger came in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the last moments, but McGregor managed to push Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Ranger replacement Glenn Middleton once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while struggling with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now, a page of our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOUR COMPUTER... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that later gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado,” with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: “What is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, it’s used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Thanks to these headphones, we can actually hear the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “Well, that’s it for sure!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
New cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells
New cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells and kill them
As part of treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally injecting them again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein “causes an increase in several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, taking immune cells to “teach” them how to target cancer cells, has been proven in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Headed with a MAGA hat, Kanye West went into a Pro-Trump rant after his transition to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed on the set after a wild performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run for office in 2020.
After his third track, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump? He’s racist!’
“Well, if racism worried me, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock meant to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that cap on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I’m in a chasm,” he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see him, the gulf?" and claimed that he would wear his superman cloak, because no one can dictate his actions to him.
Try love.”
His comments drew booing from the public at least twice and the SNL members seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. One person on the spot told the magazine: "A death silence fell on the entire plateau."
West had been called in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days earlier.
West distracted a lot of people by singing the song I Love It in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR HAD A HEAD IN THE FOLK."
But Karen Hunter, the show's host, tweeted that West was simply "loyal to himself, and that it's absolutely wonderful."
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying their music, clothes or supporting their art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion and of course the legendary fire Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, then that of the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast: Indictment of attempted murder after a gun attack on a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, the violent medieval fantasy series on HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the macho hero’s stereotype, claiming that this type of role on screen often leads young boys to pretend to be tough to cook to get respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something is wrong” and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, said he was “firmly committed” to tackling the issue.
“Personally, I think deeply that we have abused masculinity.”
“What lessons have we taught young men who are becoming adults, in relation to the problem that now arises?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What do television and the street teach young boys who make them think they have to behave like this to be a man?
I believe this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There’s obviously something wrong.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, claiming to have finished with "the battlefields and the horses."
Beginning in November, Kit will star in a cover of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this show, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on,” he says.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie's family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were infected during sex, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly to parts of the country as a result of transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protections.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee leaked senators’ data, and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were backed by experts and “far-right” websites.
“Lies, lies, and even infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It appears that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by a stranger at Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with Waters' office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a true lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It should not be provocative.
It must not call into question the motives of the accuser.
She must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the Waters headquarters in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the relevant law enforcement authorities and services” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the culprits are unmasked,” she added, “and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team.”
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, gifted spy
It has now become a tradition to seek out the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this remake of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the comeback.
Will ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent the new export chance of our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his skewed eyes and rubber face, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confusing context - this name indicates above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking cinematic audience.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charmer, possesses a bit of Clouseau, a hint of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the guy who executes a small note in The Fire Carts during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, he was also inspired by the international traveler and mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing medieval armor and the rotor blades were hitting his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although the humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses like 007 and Mission Impossible compose themselves confidently with the comedy.
The humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented and, to me, Johnny English’s wild misadventures are less creative and less focused than Atkinson’s silent film gags in the character of Bean.
The perpetually current premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of the agents on duty - an alas small-scale role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the brink of crisis and who already suffers from a political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to get under the tooth in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means you have to disturb Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a fancy establishment as a schoolteacher, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice pranks here, as English offers a Rock Academy-style spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former longtime partner, once again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, who create big trouble for Her Majesty's Secret Service, come back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the grip of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of jokes: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a blazing French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking into Volta's luxurious sailboat; and English triggers a real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are insured for this last sequence, but despite everything, there are quite a few things for the children in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t help but think, as with the other Johnny English films: can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will truly value his talent?
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britons to work four days but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week — but get paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while still earning the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic program and plans to orient the country in favor of workers.
The shift to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.”
“This will not be done in one night, but a four-day work week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour conference to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was committed to regaining power in the hands of "anonymous directors" and "profiteers" in utility companies.
The alternate chancellor's plans also provide that current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their stakes as the Labour government may make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed his plan to integrate workers into the boards of directors of companies as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who will pocket up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week following the FBI’s investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, Scott Pelley, the 60 Minutes correspondent, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Obviously,” Kennedy said.
“As I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be engraved in stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she names couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: ending poverty around the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or making any other useful effort to raise awareness of the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clicktivism” – a situation in which people really think they can make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “shares” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped inspire world leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or withdrawn.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and executives committed to “helping children develop their full potential,” while promising Rwanda <0xC2><0xA3>35 million in aid to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on her website, “What makes you think it’s possible to end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said: “The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will get there, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
U.S. could appeal to Navy to create “blockade” to impede Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" call on the U.S. Navy, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – notably where it operates at the request of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East for the purpose of negotiating energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern center of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
“The United States, along with our Navy, can ensure that shipping lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,” he added.
Zinke addressed attendees at the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “spokesperson for energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as having “more than one rope to its bow” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has pledged to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes the city of Berlin “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply economically motivated and is an example of unfair competition.
In a September speech in Moscow following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said, “I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The position of the United States has generated negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to get involved in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements concluded between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president following the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be considering running for office.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she says, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was forthright in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters are not of the opinion that she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe Center for Political Research, 58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38 percent in favor of a potential campaign and 48 percent against it.
Other prominent Democrats mentioned for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin on Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is feeling right now, what he feels when he comes home, I can connect him to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a “taboo subject” and said about his son and other veterans that “they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if you respect what their comrades and members of the air force, and every other military member, have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police service, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a drunken gun.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a memorandum in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Attorneys for states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeal Board, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of the District of Columbia, said Friday in a statement that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates this principle,” the amicus curiae said in its memoir.
Lawyers also argued in the memo that the immigration denial policy hurts the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on grounds of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political convictions,” Sessions said in his announcement of the policy.
“Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems – even the most serious – that people encounter every day around the world.”
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in an evacuation center in the drained city.
“At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen visiting their destroyed homes, picking up soaked goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who was suffering from a fractured back and shoulders, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to strong persistent aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but after the silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Intimidation’ Through ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page advertisement praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. parliamentary elections, a charge that China refutes.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in the U.S. election, Trump marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the start of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“On the other hand, at the Beijing press office, you will find few protesters and you will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on China’s disturbing economic trajectory, because the media firmly obeys the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers has avoided publishing” his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts Warn Republicans Are Alienating Voters in Approach to Midterm Elections Due to Kavanaugh Debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could come during the upcoming midterm elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, said “we can’t go back.”
Reeher added that he doubted that last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI investigation were enough to calm voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters chanted “November is coming!” in the Senate corridor as Republicans governing the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be disproportionate,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among suburban voters and young voters ages 18 to 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford's public testimony explaining in detail allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested the reaction could be lively if Republicans pushed forward the confirmation.
According to NBC News, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week that “It’s become a confusing mess for the GOP.”
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, it’s also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, told the television newspaper.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, Americans seem divided about the credibility of both sides, with a small majority leaning to the latter’s side.
A new YouGov poll found that 41% of those consulted believed Ford’s testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believe that Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, following pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court nominee would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s free Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is saved and who is authorized to access such or such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was aiming to “rule the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The peculiarity of the online store of personal data is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility via data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working under contract on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not yet in discussion with “Facebook and Google” about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely disrupted in an instant.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that “[Inrupt’s] mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a First World War clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only churchman in the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on 29 September 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was, however, killed by a sniper four days later and did not know that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
Her two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploit.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal “through very thick fog and under the violent firing of field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he rushed to the firing line and, with "greatest bravery", led the line before blowing up a field cannon on his own and knocking out three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something that I will never be up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Vann said he felt "very honored to be part of the show" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent the whole night watching a well-filled Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, six of them on the main record, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were displeased that they remained awake until the early hours of the morning, especially for combat.
One Twitter supporter described the move to children’s cartoons as “some kind of bad joke.”
Speaking about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said: “Government regulations state that at 6 a.m., this content was not suitable, so they had to switch to children’s programming.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Scott Coker, the president of the Bellator company, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee you this won't happen next time.
We’ll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to give more for the fans and we’ve ruined it all.
This is a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before going to high school that “everyone [was] not like me.”
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off because of her illness.
Appearing as a shipwrecked man on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" all other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, “Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and has taken advantage of his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The triple world champion claimed he “didn’t expect” to fall in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, his 20-year-old elder, but he said age difference had never been a problem.
“When you live so many things at such a young age” – he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he says he said it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole perspective" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, I was only thinking about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be seated in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he had to die before I finally recognized that he wasn’t invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“That’s all I’ve ever dreamed of – diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there’s nothing better,” he said.
In addition, it inspired his first choice of song - Heather Small's Proud - which had accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the chicken flesh.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 a.m., BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the bench of the Ryder Cup Saturday
Phil Mickelson will set a record this Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to rectify to avoid it being an unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who was competing in the biennial competition for the twelfth time, a record, was dropped by captain Jim Furyk from Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time great champion has split his day between the role of supporter and the fine-tuning of his game at the stand in order to remedy his ailments.
He has never been the greatest of the leaders, even at the peak of his career. At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough systematically punishes misplaced blows.
And as if the course wasn’t formidable enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood this week to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12 singles games, make a good start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a slap in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has great confidence in him.
He is a legendary champion and has added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him play two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we felt we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room.”
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He does more than just play.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the singles of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
The Dane played his first game in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually climbed to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep remembering that we were leading a lot in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but barely,” said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 Rankings winning 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at Golf National to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go all the way tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, which is to try to win this trophy, and that is what we need to stay focused on.
I have always said to focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Excited by his players’ performances on a challenging golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never get ahead on this point.
Tomorrow, it's a whole other pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performances that will be presented and it is completely different.
It’s great to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re put to the test to the fullest extent of your ability as a golfer.
This is the message to pass on to the players, is to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players score better individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of those last day reversals, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing at the end of the “Miracle of Medinah”, where Europe snatched the victory.
“I remember every word,” he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a direction, puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys in the way we thought we had to, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the counter-attack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I have accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole course,” Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman, the commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the brand new frigate ships of Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems that occurred after delivery have jeopardized the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside of the home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that the avant-garde warships – which should allow Germany to project its force overseas – will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to Hamburg’s Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and hardware defects” that made the warship useless in case of deployment on combat missions.
The software defects were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, which decreases its efficiency and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond computer system failures, the price of the project as a whole - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to 2.2 billion initially.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence commission of the German parliament, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact “out of ships able to deploy”.
The official stated that the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old vessels were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were designated.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research from a field in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats and long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using handheld detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat cries as well as the activities of the different species.
A map and habitat report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects perches and leads to the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-killing papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles on their flight path.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Domain manager David Thompson says the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Threave, we have a great place for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before proceeding with the maintenance of the properties, because unintentionally destroying a single maternity nest can cause the death of 400 females and young, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or destroy their perches.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations at the moment.”
Ronaldo refutes rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him “fake news,” and claimed that people “want to make themselves known” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said last Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, hours after the allegations were released, Ronaldo, 33, called the information “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they described as "inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape allegedly occurred, according to documents filed with Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo kneeled down after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a "good guy" at "99%" but that he didn't know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga also said she went to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an amicable settlement because she felt "terrified by reprisals" and feared "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to cancel the settlement, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve as part of a €100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK “would forever regret” the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the UK would “repent forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit.
He said it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles – built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director in Burnaston.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed their fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what automakers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “tight flow”, parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be disruptions at the border that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of coins.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls.”
“We want to have the best deal that will, as I said, not only take advantage of the current success, but also seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent set of supply chains.”
While Toyota was unable to say how long production would be shut down, it warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the union coordinator for Unite at the plant and who has worked for 24 years in Burnaston, said its members were increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs go away, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
White House Announces Trump and Rosenstein Meeting May Still Be Delayed
According to the White House announcement on Sunday, the high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by a week,” as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser charged with investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump’s collaborators and Russia and possible obstacles to justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he showed up at the White House, as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not to” fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for that, it could be this week, I could see if we push back another week given all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press up to date.”
The claim would be contested by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of the lectures was not due to an aversion to "demagogic" television reporters, although she said: "I have nothing against the fact that they amaze the gallery."
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that “the president participates in more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him”: “We checked the numbers.”
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to directly question the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it frequently, as you have seen in recent weeks, and it will take the place of a press conference where you will be able to speak to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
Rarely do they hold press conferences on their own.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times a bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
On Brexit fears, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish lawmaker Jeane Freeman sent a letter in less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of applications for status for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, withdrawal negotiations continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to lead to decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for each of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ of Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers backer, was operated on after a head injury Saturday in the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27 loss.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the state of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He got on the touch line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to another test.
A representative from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room of the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there was "no clarification yet on the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury had occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore athlete, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total of the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duties if they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty tariff if they buy property in the UK – the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will be used to bolster the government’s efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of London’s new buildings are purchased by non-UK residents, driving up prices and preventing first-time buyers from gaining a foothold in the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in stamp duty in order to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing large construction companies of keeping real estate prices at a high level by grabbing land without using it, he called on May to give up affordable housing quotas in order to deal with the “real estate disgrace” that is raging in the UK.
Corbyn presented an attractive set of housing reform proposals, including rent control and the elimination of “no-fault” evictions.
It also wants to give the councils wider powers to build new housing.
Ms May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime ministership to the rebirth of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to fix our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for non-UK residents, as for foreign companies, to buy a home as it is for hard-working UK residents.
For far too many people, the dream of accessing property has become distant and the misery of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is delighted to take on the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which is currently third in Ligue 1, three points behind the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching the Scottish games at Hampden with my father and that’s something I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would only arise if I succeeded in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coaches are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he did not hesitate to rank behind such iconic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured by the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself a success here only if I managed to get the club back there.”
Ross has only three years as a coach, after a stint as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months with the Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa come back from a relegation to the third division and turned St Mirren, who was on the brink of relegation, into a great championship winner the following season.
Ross feels more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Alloa’s care “was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really felt that being a coach was better for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did well, I made a good living and I enjoyed some appreciable peaks.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of details to settle every week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is fine with me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been in my whole adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwave has boosted revenues for struggling British pubs, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that bars and pubs groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, which compiled the data, said: “England’s permanent sunshine and longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed the pattern of June, when bars had grown by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which suffered an even greater shock.
The decrease of 1.8% in June in the catering sector only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most in vogue, with more points of resemblance than restaurants dropping.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
It seems people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, a specialist analyst in leisure and hospitality at RSM, said: “These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that the catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decrease in sales of 4.8% on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to the ongoing pressures on costs.
The long, hot summer could not have been less opportune for food operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will grant a well-deserved respite.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in settlement.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined sales of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the industry standard.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children – some as young as 11 – has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in “fake Insta” pages
The news heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a “main” account to show to their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – opens a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid growth of “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported running a cleaned “main” account to show to their parents, while still having a private account.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website discovered a teenager who was inciting others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11 to 18-year-olds have a double profile, with half of students admitting to having private accounts.
MSC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as a non-executive director at the governing body’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in athletics, and President Ian Beattie described this choice as a great opportunity for the sport’s leaders to leverage their vast experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh has tremendous respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit tremendously from his participation on the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 200m and 400m events at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after undergoing a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Online, a breast pump ad that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertisement from a company offering a breast pump compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during milking.
To mark the launch of what is known as “the world’s first silent breast pump,” Elvie, a consumer technology company, has launched a bold music video-inspired ad to show the freedom its new breast pump offers to breastfeeding women.
In a cow barn filled with hay, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I’m cheating on myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, it’s my breasts, not breasts.”
The refrain continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women milking the milk.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a poor decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days after they are born,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “This is understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who babysit?”
Someone else added: “An advertisement so disconnected.”
Others have defended advertising, for example a woman admitting that she found the song “hilarous.”
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pomper gave me the impression of being a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a fun advertisement for moms who pull their milk (often at their workplace or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal they danced with the discreet breast pumps hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, without wires or pipes and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO at Mother, commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to emphasize the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while at the same time expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new breast pump will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie has made headlines.
During fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on designer Marta Jakubowski’s podium while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly settled in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, in part due to the Trump administration’s harsh speeches and policies complicating the placement of children with respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared compromising their own ability to stay in the country by going to the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective respondents and adult members of their household should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be forwarded to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no legal history.
“Nearly 80% of people who are respondents or family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people,” said Mr. Albence.
According to shelters, in order to deal more quickly with children, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to plead their case with respect to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed ineligible will be expelled promptly.
According to stakeholders and reports that have been presented in recent months by the shelter network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become distressed or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs indicating a child is in trouble are more likely to be overlooked because of its size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have a hard time dealing with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they “would be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” of both terrorist groups and any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moualem said conditions were favorable for refugees to return, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational concerns" that discouraged refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have said that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end this war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the latest rebel stronghold of Idlib has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement provided for “precise deadlines” and expressed the hope that the military measures will target jihadists, especially Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to al-Qaeda and who “will be eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a UN representative, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, stating that the group’s work should be limited “to the revision of the articles of the current constitution,” and issued a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as no doubt many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
What would arguably be "the most spectacular finale of a presidency!"
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reaches 3.5 million viewers at the big parties, is the first cable TV channel.
“It’s a case that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama “Designated Survivor,” which talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comic author and author of Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about slipping into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike anything that happens on television, Washington’s scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade affair, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself staring for six hours at a panel of experts debating how Bob Woodward used “deep craftsmanship” for his book “Fear,” on Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment full of pride,” according to the Washington Post.
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“If part of what he’s doing feels like a reality show, it’s because he makes you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s shifting teams and day-to-day turnarounds (fighting with the NFL, congratulating Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise we're lagging behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees at his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was standing inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand aside, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the days when we were animating all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Foreign money invades the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of congressional constituencies that allowed two incumbents to compete in the same seat.
This recently restructured suburban district of Pittsburgh is the seat of Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which heavily overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that former boroughs were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district kicked off a clash over campaign finance between major party finance branches, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrowly won victory last March in a very popular special election in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then backed down
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, to which Washington had little opposition.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to convene the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions have been envisaged only against El Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from travelling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now speaking at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without further messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying History
The next tile could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible impediment to Trump’s justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mueller would also direct his investigation toward the issue of a connivance of Trump’s campaign with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If congressional control changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself held accountable to that body as he prepares to stand before voters and, perhaps, before a jury of his peers.
These are many “ifs”, and I do not claim that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and pushed back the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these divisions and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or being delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that last year he proposed secretly registering the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we answer if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial – or if it is convicted in the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump to account?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will pass a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With this heritage as a legacy, I can’t help but be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienne
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first appearance of the season until the 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the most of such a result to achieve feats.
“It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team,” commented the 31-year-old forward.
“We went into the game thinking about getting something and we left with a point.
We could have won in the end, but on the whole, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck we can hope to get three points, but it will be a tough match because they made a good result in their last match, however I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
“Last year has been really tough, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let’s hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind and triumph.”
Women no longer sleep because of this fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they told their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not doing what it takes to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouses and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes to them well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a buy-back hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover those expenses, or other insurance on your estate – provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the process.
Provide a health care proxy that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Think about the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place.”
Man repeatedly injured with a compressed-air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed-air rifle as he walked home from an evening.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which occurred at approximately 2:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the toll is expected to rise.
Since communications were paralyzed, rescue services were unable to receive any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake epicentre.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, whose population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that runs along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency population, an administrative region below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Circle of Seismic Fire and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province triggered a tsunami that swept 14 countries, killing 226,000 on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 shook the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake shook Pidie Jaya’s regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation wrought by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes shook the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, contravening a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is being held on unsecured bail of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, pleading "not guilty, that's for sure" when his plea was asked, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and is liable to a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B minor offence, which was punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His wife claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck just off central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu at the time the tsunami raged on the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Demand Rare Death Penalty for Person Suspected of Terrorist Attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who killed eight people — a rare sentence that has not been enforced in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing pedestrians and a cyclist on his route last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury sentenced Saipov to 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "careful preparation and premeditation," prosecutors said, calling Saipov's method "odious, cruel and depraved."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not demanded the death penalty in the past 10 years.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was later sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case concerning Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for committing acts of conspiracy and espionage for the USSR in the two years following the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities he had been incited to commit the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the Daesh flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the decision to bring suit.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilt and sentence him to life in prison with no possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had already asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to “mobilize the people’s army” at a rally at the Conservative conference.
The former UK Independence Party official said politicians should "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested, he should be tasked with negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would have “already been liberated” if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma that Mrs May is facing to reconcile her deeply divided troops has been underscored by conservatives in favor of staying in the Union who have joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to get out and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its program and "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of Chequers.”
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the task of negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have gone out already,” he said.
The member for Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We did not engage in world wars to submit.
We want to make our own legislation in our own homeland.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely wrong.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of leaving, was also present at the march to tell reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is also the case of our party and our activists who roam the streets and make us elect first and foremost.
Abandon Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians must be brought to “feel the pressure” if they were to betray the decision that was taken as part of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to cheat Brexit and we’re telling them today, “We’re not going to let you out like that.”
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has allowed us to win the Brexit victory and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, pro-European followers marched through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of activists waved Conservative banners against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of the security issues surrounding the party's enforcement at the start of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a real farce.
A good Brexit doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider running for president
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the GOP’s representative in the states, who was co-chair in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has found herself at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters as part of a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman at the head of the state.”
Arrested in the shooting death of Sims from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying a man who was featured in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and succumbed to his injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being at the scene, possessing a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Service.
Sims, a 2-metre youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 as a starter last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heading for world title after team directives allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became apparent from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified by beating Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's directives would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas took a good start and approached Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to go into the turmoil at the tail of the pack, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the pits a lap later and ended up behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside at the risk of resisting after a double attempt to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first lap to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a fast finish and lead Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He eventually reached the pits on the 44th lap, but was unable to speed up the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a one-two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who said she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly evoke Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest."
“The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that’s going on in the Senate these last few days, when you see anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“Seeing the disclosures and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you divulge any information?
Remember his answer... did you divulge information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not divulged anything."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we disclose information... No, we did not disclose information,” he added, thinking of the senator’s impression.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford last July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t cover up Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t divulge his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: "I'll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Pursuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that Democrats were using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the meanness, the meanness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars cleared their Elite League loss on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return game in Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home tie before Dwyer gave the Giants back the advantage.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, securing their victory.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night after being caught.
It was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two sides, with the Giants triumphing in the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan restarted the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt put himself in the service of Cownie, at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard again equalized with a goal giving a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing the victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal in the middle.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died while helping hundreds of people on board an airplane escape from the quake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died by making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the area and large numbers of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to give up his post in the violently shaken tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained on site to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our heart is broken to learn this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country’s disaster prevention agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The toll would continue to rise as many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters have ravaged Palu which will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross runs to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now declares that a man has disappeared after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline that handled the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing after all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it had not been able to trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were involved in rescuing other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said Saturday that six passengers were still in hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had landed too low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others had been able to slip into the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He stated that the flight attendants panicked and yelled, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve a wharf had also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people to the mainland before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in registered airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned his case on Saturday at the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone phone records to track the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that indicated Tellis was meeting with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' house when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he "[was] lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ texts, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by imbuing its music with positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed claims hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York City nanny sues couple for firing her after ‘racist’ texting
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a mistaken message from the mother who complained that she was “still a Black woman.”
The couple refutes being racist, and equates the prosecution with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she noted in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO NOW A BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Yet instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her "uncomfortable" blunder, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, explaining that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was rather waiting for a Filipina.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day’s work and then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Mauritius is suing the couple for compensation for her removal and is claiming $350 per day for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do that kind of thing,” she clarified to the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after hurting him.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Equating the trial with “extortion,” Plasco said his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
“Would you pursue someone like that?”
This is not a very pleasant thing to do,” added the business banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the public opinion court did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s a lot of fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a little teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication had had a "bitter-sweet" flavor after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and adds that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a fairly calm man, and he wasn’t a pretentious one,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child succeeding at something: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really his own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter had been taken urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad was calling regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect her to get away with it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to let me know that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to maintain her heart rate were slowly depleting and coming out of her system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I could not scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, regardless of the ordeal she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“My head was down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide strive to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a Welsh bridge containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up any room.”
However, he quit his job before dying, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, it was Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly concerned that there will be a driving effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards “to let people know that there are people you can go see and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t keep silent – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt down, depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day — when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t have eye contact with them or anything.”
She said her death had been a huge trauma to them, but they need to get away with it: “It’s heartbreaking for the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for — a time-limited investigation, limited in scope — maybe we could bring some unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “collapse” into a partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, on November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans achieve a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to split the vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of deserters “falling” under Kim’s leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions took place last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and increased tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
The vast majority of deserters in the North will eventually be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had previously remained pending.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed broadly to work towards a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to carry out unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit to sit on the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have called her “hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes nearly screamed and choked as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations about him a “grotesque and coordinated assassination” organized by disappointed liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, since he showed he was against the Democrats.
“I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he has dealt with the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but he is also unfit to sit on the court where he is currently sitting,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation of charges hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh evaded the question of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that overflow, and she can't get her out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, do you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to say to the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried, ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with inexpressible rage, was being grabbed by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman — a cold manager who had always terrified me a little bit — who dragged me up a staircase.
“Don’t let them see you cry under any circumstances,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re delighted because they’ve got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic MP for Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she laughed, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates running, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone had called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was very advanced, she had fallen behind in fundraising, and therefore swore that she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters, who usually donated $1,000 to men, only intended to give her $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions — the gratitude for the people who had supported her, the frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger at sexism — that she felt dizzy.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled of the press reaction to her.
“You would have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my gravestone.
“She cried?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The first rounds of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing retaliated in kind, recently hitting tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the United States, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to falter anytime soon.
To push back Washington is to give in to demands, but to give in publicly to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to an economic slowdown in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the think tank at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria declares itself ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5-10.5 at Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the 14.5-point mark needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble for most of the tournament, kicked his start into the water in the 16th hole in par-3, ceding his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5-4 by the worst-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the all-time European champion with a total of 25.5 career points.
“In general, I don’t cry, but today it’s stronger than me.
It was a busy year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help them,” Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passed the torch to fellow golfer John Ram, who beat U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played well.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we’re going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We have to bow down.
We have exceeded it.”
Red Tide Info Point: Decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - fearing declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from north of Pinellas to south of Lee counties.
Islets are found about 10 miles (16 km) off Hillsborough County, but in fewer locations than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations at the bottom of Sarasota County or offshore, high concentrations in Charlotte County, and low concentrations in the bottom of the county.
Respiratory irritation persists in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
