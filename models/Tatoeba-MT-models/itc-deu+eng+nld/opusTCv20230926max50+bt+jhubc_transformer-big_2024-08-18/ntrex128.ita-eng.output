Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned about "becoming clowns"
There is dismay among some members of the Assembly over the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This proposal came about as a result of plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the entire political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party is concerned that "it may rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means jerk and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said he was "open" to the name change, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet.
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter U.
The assembly committee, which is currently drafting the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what members of the assembly will be called will obviously be a matter of debate for the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received broad support for the possibility of calling the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option received greater consensus in a public consultation.
The MOUs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The MFAs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for the referendum on the change of the name of the country
On Sunday voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long said that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the outcome of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent as Harlem's churches are in trouble
“The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
"There's neither of them today."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he explained.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people frequent regularly.”
As for churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets won’t last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they’ll go back to where they started.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who won’t help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for that reason will hasten the time when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that much of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by fraternities before Harlem became a black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation headed by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson’s parishioners were planning its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin’s in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by lay leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese was "trying to unburden the costs" on the parish assembly although the latter was not involved in hiring architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures Thirteen-Year-Old in California Lobster Dive
Officials say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California on Saturday during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream and swam up to him with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was just enthusiasm due to catching a lobster but then "he realized that the boy was screaming 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His entire collarbone was torn," he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is not known.
Beachkeeper Captain Larry Giles said in a statement to the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the area, but that it had been declared non-hazardous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans a push towards the beauty products industry in the UK
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store beauty lanes assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market push, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and home goods sectors decline, the largest lanes dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and adopted in multiple stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for new ways to use shelf space once dedicated to TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its beauty products offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most products are vegan – a quality increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will experiment with licensing at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to commit more to convincing people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain seeks to resist discounters like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since it purchased the two chains about two years ago, and that strategy has boosted food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to restore enamel to its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenues from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and convenient locations make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her trending brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of housewives and Truly accessories.
The pair's activity had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host used Instagram to announce her abandonment.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones, furious after retiring from their lucrative last-minute trending brand business to focus on her outstanding new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furious" when the golden girl on TV admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her trading empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - did not leave her enough time to devote to their brand of Truly housewives and accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and it was calculated that it would double Willoughby's estate, estimated at around <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: "Truly was without a doubt Holly's top priority.
It had to be her long-term future that would engage her for the next 20 years.
His decision to abandon left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the abandonment of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to heavy investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays to the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent the holidays together and Jones owned a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a guest on ITV’s I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that he "does not wish to comment on his business affairs."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would have deemed "non-presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "newsreader".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He stressed that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not observed an “equivalent response” from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining high pressure.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
“With North Korea, we are getting very good results,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages, and the repatriation of the last U.S. military personnel.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s simple to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded camp, we would have about 200 people right here in front of us,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, claiming hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been displaced, the national emergency had not been declared, an essential requirement to activate international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it’s a bit complicated,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid.
Considering the earthquakes that Indonesia is continually undergoing, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not a common facility on other coasts.
The obvious lack of an alarm siren for the tsunami in Palu, although the alarm was given, probably contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo has focused on improving Indonesia’s shredded infrastructure and poured money into roads and railways.
But lack of funds has hit Joko's administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes due to clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool draws against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a point in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 yards from Chelsea's goal, with his team down 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second post.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it turned toward the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga and got into the net.
"Just try to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I gave a touch and I didn't think too much and I pulled."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after the 25th minute goal scored by Belgium star Eden Hazard.
Blue’s centre-forward passed Mateo Kovacic before splashing away near midfield and shooting in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
So he performed a beautiful pass that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up on the second pole with a left goal over Liverpool’s Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, Indonesia’s disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Several people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and generated waves as high as 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning but I would like to appeal to anyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have registered something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location of the discovery this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they are currently informing the victim’s family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a scene of the crime.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m. two police vans were inside the demarcated area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the demarcated area checking the apartment building.
Anyone with information on this is invited to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating the record 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "rewriting history"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal a "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in light of the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from outside pressures, in his case of course from the monarchy.
Whether this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure representing a part of that fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig Killer Snakes Chinese Farmer by Killing Him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a piglet at Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs at a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby piggy was open.
He claimed that in the piglet was a large male pig with blood on its snout.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had torn the farmer apart, according to the statements.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and bruised,” said the cousin identified with the surname “Wu,” as reported in Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people, while police gathered evidence at the scene of the crime.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer’s death.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst.”
“They just want to play.
They are playful, very curious... they don’t want to hurt.
Just show them the right amount of respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa trawls will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains over northern Mexico and the southwestern coast of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds of up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 ET on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a sack is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, she will begin to push strong tropical moisture northward into the southwestern part of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day on Monday.
Thus, tropical moisture in contact with the approaching puff will create heavy and vast rainfall in the southwestern zone in the coming days.
At the local level, 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm of rain is expected in some areas of the southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
There may be sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could make river canyons flood, and thunderstorms will blow winds and lift dust.
The approaching sacking will cause heavy rains locally on part of the southern California coast.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery lanes.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona towards the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more extensive late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
There will be strong temperature fluctuations over the U.S. in October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain warm enough.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature variations over short distances.
An exceptional example of significant temperature differences in the central U.S. will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the residual heat of summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm early October is expected for much of the central and eastern U.S., with 26<0xC2><0xB0>C from the Southern Plains to the northeastern areas.
New York can reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate strong above-average temperature probabilities for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed Thursday on six television networks the compelling deposition by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues, with broadcasters halting regular programming for a last-minute turnaround on Friday: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Committee that she is 100% certain that Kavanaugh had been groping her drunk and trying to undress her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposition, said he was 100% sure this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, it’s an audience similar to that for a football playoff game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose reviewers strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning as he was being insulted by demonstrators as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He remained with his eyes down for several minutes as he was reprimanded and broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have the power while a lot of women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the charges against the candidate over the next week, as requested by minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘making politics’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of letting the European Union "do politics" with Britain's future and jeopardize the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside that with the prime minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Brexit deal, stating that a proposal that Britain and the EU must levy their respective duties is “absolutely ridiculous”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest LSU Player Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson’s DNA on them, reports the CBS-affiliated WAFB television station.
After questioning Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
The East Baton Rouge coroner’s office issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department acknowledged the merits of the Louisiana State Police Fugitives Task Force, the Police Scientist Lab, Southern University Police, and the area’s citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the area law enforcement for their commitment and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was “shocked” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
“This is what you care about at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano sprinkles with ash Mexico City
The ash coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity had increased in the crater and there were 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center was checking the different rhombuses and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash lining the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano that lies 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police riot squads and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia’s controversial vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists hampered by riot police targeted the police with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
There were further clashes during the day with police officers who resorted to batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “We will not forget, we will not forgive” confronted unionist protesters shouting “Long live Spain.”
Local media reported that fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although the turnout was low, and Catalans opposed to secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the referendum taking place in seats across the region.
The pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I’ve seen my parents cry with joy for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked,” he explained.
Despite a key, albeit measurable, victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement's best-known leaders either in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded with her phone the protest in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both factions.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison pending trial since the end of last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“Presenting myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Driving Home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly crashing into a Londonderry home in a car.
The accident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at approximately 7:30 p.m. BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a crossbow at some point.
Menga's attack marks Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston won
The already promoted Livingston left the Rangers stunned by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference as Gary Holt's team moved into the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team is therefore without a win out in the Premiership this season and will face next Sunday the first in the Hearts standings, from which they separate 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues their winning streak in the division, remaining unbeaten for six games, with coach Holt still having to see a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston wastes opportunity against incisive guests
Holt’s team should have been ahead well before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow was only able to kick out the door after stepping in to meet Craig Halkett's header across the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could put the visitors in trouble with placed kicks.
This is how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, who could score from the center of the area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated in ball possession but the host team’s defense had proven impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly hadn’t had to worry too much.
This pattern was maintained during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped by the feet of Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston game scheme.
The crosses followed each other in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two demands for rigor, after Halkett's contrast with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for hand foul, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and teammates have changed very little since their return to the top of the series, but we have to give a lot of credit to Holt for the way he has been able to spur the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a masterfully organized defense, while Menga challenged Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performance at times with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below these standards.
The last pass was missed - only once did they manage to penetrate the opponent's area - and it can be considered a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan received with mixed reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at relaxing relations between NATO allies.
They clashed over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a new massive mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population group outside Turkey.
Police have reasoned with security reasons for the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including numerous Kurds, have voiced their condemnation of Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent provoked by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks from Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in clash with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeastern area of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The crash came months after another cyclist died, hit by a road pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's crash occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said authorities were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Wounded During Disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a disorder at the maximum security male prison, the prison office said.
The riot erupted at the Long Lartin maximum security male prison in Worcestershire at approximately 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist agents "Tornado" have been employed to manage the turmoil, which involves eight inmates and which is confined to a prison wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to contain an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison.”
The Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital care following the attack on a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-riot agents were called to intervene in the prison to quell a violent riot during which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwestern desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona as far as southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have kept the tropical storm or tropical depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The most recent models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern area, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks of up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is affected by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be positive as the southwestern area is currently going through a period of drought.
According to the Center for Drought Monitoring, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
Initially the path of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land through the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds at a top speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the colder waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected to arrive in Mexico with tropical storm strength in the afternoon or in the evening on Monday.
Precipitation over parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation between 7.5 cm and 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a tropical depression state, then head through Arizona and toward southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that may be caused by Rosa or her wreckage is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert zone of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Such rains are expected to generate potentially lethal sudden flooding and debris flows into deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who may have picked up what happened with their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered from Democratic Party malice and anger'
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered from the evil and anger” of the Democratic Party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, passionately and decisively denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual assault against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also deposed at the hearing defending himself against the prosecution.
The president said Saturday that "the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a jurist with an unparalleled record in public service,” he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m really busy,” he said.
"For this lot strenuously for outstanding candidates."
Trump said Democrats are committed to “resisting and hindering.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many wiped out by giant waves that hit beaches when a large-magnitude earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when waves as high as 6 meters (18 feet) hit the beach in the twilight, sweeping away numerous people killing them and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away, thus turning into victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster control agency BNPB, told Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit anything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have boosted the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “extended” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300 km (190 mi) coast north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally paralyzed, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area,” the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the areas involved.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had struck Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alarm was sounded.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming agitated way to warn people of the tsunami coming in the street below.
A few minutes later a wall of water came down on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
According to authorities, the army has started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has been reopened for relief only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's terrible.
Although Donggala’s World Vision staff managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where employees took refuge under tarpaulin shelters in the backyard of their office, along the way they encountered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even as the rescue groups began the difficult operations of starting the rescue gears, there were some complaints that foreign rescue workers with extensive knowledge were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations state that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And that has not yet happened.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined.”
The second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the missing still held out hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was pulled out of a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been stranded under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the missing paraglider pilots.
Others among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran in the paragliding industry, I’m carrying my emotional load,” he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single gray tick instead of two blue marks.
“I think it means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was resupplying an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM at the entertainment center and was preparing to deliver more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "came out behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag with the money destined for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information regarding the identities of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
In announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change came ahead of her appearance at Saturday Night Live, where she will present her new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains for him a religious meaning.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We have gone from Kanye, which means the one, to simply Ye – the reflection of our goodness, our wickedness, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are.”
He is just one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed his name with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use the army to repress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were gaining ground across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said unemployment and a lack of training opportunities are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the funds dedicated to research in this field, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements by several U.S. government groups about AI, although in the U.S. a formal AI strategy is generally lacking.
Meanwhile, China presented its program last year: it aims to be the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the US and we need a new revolution in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI success will be achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that beat the American Otello player with the highest score and subsequently served as a director at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be held, in order to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is taking away the leaders in academia, it’s the multinationals,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to AI PhD students,” he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. order to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not recorded activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its neighbours constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would damage the ethnic identity of the Slavic-majority Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about the possibility that the turnout will reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: “He agrees with the accession to NATO and the EU and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece.”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to pay for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries since the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters had cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the Macedonian referendum to change the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Paramento in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and setting up the chairs in front of the tents set up by those who want to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter head-on, not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He declared that a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would have participated in the referendum - a percentage below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia, indicated that 57% of respondents planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scores a goal avoiding Brighton's entire defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defence during the 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his point scored in the 65th minute seem extremely easy.
The Argentinian striker received a midfield pass at the start of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting to the free field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated one defender before overcoming several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
He then made a left-hand pass, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-hander in the net.
"Aguero is having foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he managed to score at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep on the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net shortly before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But the as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who maintain an advantage of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least one rematch with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to win their title in the first division.
“Even if we play without a goal, at least we can be able to pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
Why shouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a first pitcher for Sunday, but they are said to be prone to let Scherzer pitch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be first pitcher for the 34th time, ran a pitching session on Thursday and would be first pitcher on his normal Sunday off.
Washington’s pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings for this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the turnout of Republicans in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is put into play in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really working hard, and that's why I'm fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, “Let’s see this horrible group of radical Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power using any means necessary, you can see the wickedness, the meanness.
They don’t care who they can hit, who they have to overwhelm in order to regain power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control and we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of “resisting and hindering.”
“And it’s been possible to see it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, mean, petty and liars.”
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, triggering loud whistles among the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one - that was a bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer tolerant.
Don’t tolerate people who say what they think
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, it wasn’t a big surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour members of parliament who have been told they are not welcome, and all because they said what they thought.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan was treated similarly because he resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all topics similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a member of the local Labour Party parliament, Friday night meetings were exactly like that.
However, today this is not the tone of numerous meetings and the promise of a "kinder and courteous" policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable to party leadership.
This all began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a similar political vision began to expect a reversal on my part and that I would take positions that I would never accept, whether it was national security or the European single market.
When I speak in public — and it doesn’t really matter what I say — they follow social media insults calling for my withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policy and telling me that I shouldn’t be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be of a political nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of the levels of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of distrust or modification of the selection rules, the party shrinks.
In the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would have gone well".
But it is not to do this that I entered politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thatcher government’s carelessness that had let my high school class literally fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need them most, as a local councilor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way bewildered by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of what I believe are your best interests.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeaten Ayr climbs the standings
Two late attempts may have somehow unbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun game of the Tennent championship day.
I'm now at the top of the standings, the only unbeaten team out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that drove the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been put to the test in our matches so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” the coach said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “We have to acknowledge the merit of Ayr, they have better exploited the opportunities of us.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute goal, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought Ayr to the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, freed from the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to get the numbers out and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo increased the distance of the Ayr with a penalty before, just in half-time, to score and then convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 in the interval.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s goal, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long break due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, which was rolled out, and at the restart, the Ayr jumped back into the lead thanks to a Stafford McDowall goal converted by Climo.
Ayr substitute captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose charged the extra man with an unconverted goal by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a time of heavy pressure.
The home team is back, though, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a ballless Climo touchdown, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr's advancing melee.
Climo converted, as he had done almost since the reboot, after Rowe had picked up the football from David Armstrong's area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to search for the home team's fifth goal.
Star of Still Game is looking for a new career in the catering industry
Ford Kieran, a star of Still Game, decided to move to the hospitality industry after discovering he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor stars as Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and performs with longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series will also be the show’s definitive one, and it looks like Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official lists of reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to make statements, although a source in the Scottish Sun said Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous catering trade."
''The sea is ours'': the landlocked Bolivia hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters lined with rigging in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coast and now in Chile’s hands after a bloody conflict over 19th-century resources is still alive, as is the desire to once again sail the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have perhaps reached the highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and obviously it is waiting for the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia's claim that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile will be obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia a sea outlet under the State's jurisdiction.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year – has a lot at stake with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that it would change little if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has specified that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final ruling indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morale’s belligerent rhetoric has shattered any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions following what happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly expeditious.
On Monday, Bolivia will enjoy “extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile” and will have the opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements to the mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied he Morales - one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as a political escapade.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Take Place Without Trust in U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never disarm nuclear weapons unless it could first trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears intent on restarting stalled diplomatic talks after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an “illusion” that the continuation of sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington warns against issuing the declaration without Pyongyang first carrying out major disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is willing to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows present the latest trend in huge headgear that will soon be in a haute couture store near you
If you want to expand your headgear collection or completely block the sun’s rays, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the catwalks a series of crazy oversized headgear for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have been raging on Instagram this summer and these stylists have sent their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like edge that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple - but they weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have sewn lips and look more like a Hannibal Lecter representation than haute couture.
One creation resembled a diving suit with mask and goggles, while another looked like a loose ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the huge statements of style, you are lucky.
Observers of the style predict that the huge caps could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats come in the wake of "The Bomb", the straw hat with a span over a meter wide that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that invaded social media sent another huge creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag almost as big as the costume model that carries it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and a white leather handle was the highlight of the spring-summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect these great beach hats and bags to arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the stylist has made such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test scores, bolstered by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further higher education, their chosen career and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of developing and adopting a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and in-demand subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will come to his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build trusting relationships with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest marks.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students received the highest grade with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish received the highest grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as core skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, technique and mathematics) in the curricula of independent institutes and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons employees indicated for the difficulty in filling jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
This is why language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a lifetime competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That’s why investing in language teaching is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of more languages, particularly those in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s pre-championship opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it has yet to be determined for how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game pre-championship schedule.
“At this point in my career I don’t need friendly matches to prepare myself,” he said.
The moment of the gathering a West Virginia of Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a barrage of rallies.
This is the first of five gatherings planned for Trump in the coming week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for his choice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in November’s election.
What time will Trump’s rally be and how can you follow him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia online at via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will likely discuss this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over sexual assault allegations with an early Senate confirmation vote pending for a week as the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November election get some momentum.
So, President Trump’s campaign stated that these five gatherings over the next week are aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so crucial to his program that the president will travel in as many states as possible as we go through the campaign’s busiest season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, tonight’s rally could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh media coverage,” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is queuing in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows courage to fight to keep hopes alive until singles on Sunday
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum motion is a totally invented sporting concept in which players believe firmly and never like in races like these.
So where would the bike be now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I’d say we’re keeping a little bit of the bike,” Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, four points ahead with another twelve at stake.
The Americans feel they have a little wind in their favor, as Spieth said, and have a lot to be hopeful about, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth has been ruthless from the tee to the green and is setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration grew louder as the game went on, sinking a crucial putt to even out the bills at game four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt that made them win the 15-hole game was greeted with a similar scream, the one that tells you he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
“You really have to worry about your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four by four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only pair not to pull a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole on Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the noisy crowd, reinforces the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European speeches of glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon joined Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes sank the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could not even remotely climb.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and don’t give, and the way strategy can change at a time.
Europe have played better as a team so far and have gained a major lead in the final day but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup final day
Europe will have a solid lead in the Ryder Cup final day after finishing Saturday’s fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score so far to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, in an attempt to keep the trophy lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over an irregular American team in the morning fourballs, winning 3-1.
The U.S. held out more in the foursome, winning two games, but failed to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known by the name "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a knocked down Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even sharper 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself for two games on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to side with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the results it hoped for on a pleasant and ventilated day southwest of Paris.
The three-time big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They took a gritty 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Spain’s Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team returned from a four-point gap to singles, although as a starter, Furyk's team only needs a draw to defend the trophy.
After being second best for two days, however, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea Absolutely Refuses Untrustworthy Unilateral Disarmament
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that maintaining sanctions was exacerbating the country's distrust of the United States, which in such circumstances would absolutely refuse to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's General Assembly that North Korea has taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any compliant response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the U.S. there will be no security in our national security and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ri has reused known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization with which North Korea would be rewarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not entirely reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has already done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised North Korean security guarantees.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to loosen rigid international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on the need to “have denuclearization first” and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner and even opposes the “declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion of those who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced at the UN earlier this week.
The minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the counterpart to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be dead at this point."
But even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was markedly different from last year’s speech at the UN General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to target U.S. territory with North Korea’s missiles after “evil president” Trump had called Kim a “missile man” engaged in a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in embarking on the disarmament path, but said much more needs to be done and that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no deadline, saying that “whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
Cinema and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that, “Compliance with Security Council sanctions must continue forcefully and without exception until complete, final and established denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously backed sanctions to control North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of filing "gangster requests."
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and nuclear complex if the U.S. took “compliant measures.”
He said Kim had explained to him that the “conforming measures” he wanted were security guarantees Trump had pledged in Singapore and actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all of its students to sleep longer in an attempt to counteract the growing masculine culture of studying for whole nights powered by caffeine.
One university scholar found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea of the basic concepts of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She had the idea to start the course after a lecture she had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now, when I’m in my senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me a lot," she told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general manager of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a dormitory room, where students can select coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as they have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the “blank night studying” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to lack of sleep being an ever-growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and with good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to fight stress, fatigue, anxiety, he explained and even should serve to avoid getting fat since lack of sleep brings the brain into starvation mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the faculty of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course after taking one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar program of study before enrolling in this competitive institute.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for when they need to go to bed, as well as when they need to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another off-home depression attack with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking for the first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second loss in 18 coaching games leaving his team eight points behind the running leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and a short-inspired Rangers lineup never seemed able to tie.
While the Ranger now drops to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, and only behind the Hibernian for goal difference.
And there could be more problems coming up for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence was treated for a head injury due to an object apparently thrown out of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly overtook Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual lineup that tore a point at Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-prepared team suffocated his opponents on every lap.
The Rangers may have dominated for ball possession but the Livingston has made better use of the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's first-half pass pushed Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder wasted the opportunity.
A deep penalty kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pull to the side on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their play in the penalty area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to be given a penalty at the end of the fifteenth following a clash with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the demands of the Colombian.
The Rangers managed to shoot only twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was unconcerned by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a soft shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even for his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a deep placed kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher leaked the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the gearbox had an almost immediate impact as the wing shoved a ball into Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw herself from the goal line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased the detachment in the final stages, but McGregor opposed stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton filed a final penalty request after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTACT continues... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as a Geiger counter.
A staple of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those unreliable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earbuds on you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say a little bit, it's just bursting right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then “see” a protein common to many types of cancer and are then reinjected.
An experimental trial of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovarian cancer go away for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to numerous types of cancer, called HER2, and then those cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar process of extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself into a pro-Trump quarrel wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was whistled in the studio during a Saturday Night Live episode after an inconclusive performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA hat, he started a rage against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
So many times I talk to white people and they say to me, “How you like Trump, he’s a racist!”
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began the show with a screenplay starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission against allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's Philippine recording was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had a bad time in the backstage because of his headdress.
“I was bullied in the backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with that hat on.’
They bullied me!
And so they told me I’m an outcast,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the place submerged?" and said, "I would wear the Superman cloak because that means you can't tell me what I have to do.
Try the love.”
His comments generated whistles at least twice from the audience, and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with one person telling the newspaper: "A deadly silence fell on the studio."
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West stunned many with a performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR HAD ONE HEAD TO THE MASS.”
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “what it is and that’s just wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is embracing a vomitable ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so we are,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion and of course the late musical legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and then in the artist previously known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted stabbing murder at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a Belfast restaurant on Friday.

The defendant is due to appear at the Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Throne of Swords star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Swords.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the macho hero's stereotype, stating that such on-screen floors often make boys believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something went wrong” and reflected on how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old co-star of Throne of Swords, has admitted to worrying a lot about this issue.
“Personally I’m worried, very much at the moment – what was our mistake with masculinity?” he said.
‘What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we are seeing now?’
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: ‘What is innate and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes kids think they have to be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time – how can we change things?
Because obviously something went wrong for the young people.”
In the course of the interview he also admitted that he will not play any prequels or sequels to Throne of Swords once the series ends next summer, stating that he "has finished with battlefields and horses".
Beginning in November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s True West revival, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with Throne of Swords.
“I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this sense my future family, and my life from now on,” he explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow, the character of Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens affected by HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported as early as the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China HIV has spread in the past as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said during a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country’s traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators’ data, and speaks of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
She denounced on Saturday the accusations against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the legislators’ Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic congresswoman from Los Angeles said the statements were fomented by op-eds and websites from the “ultra-right wing.”
"Lies, lies and still despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released would include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday, released by an anonymous Capitol Hill official during a hearing of an expert panel on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released information relating to a Waters staff member.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been jeopardized as a result of these false and biased allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of that information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ claim quickly drew online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
It should not call into question the accuser's reasons.
You need to stay calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by detractors of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in a race to oust Waters in the midterm elections, voiced his views on Twitter.
“Enormous if confirmed,” he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters said that its office has alerted “competent authorities and law enforcement to these biased claims.
“We will ensure that those responsible are exposed and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are dangerous and harmful to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English's review hits again - the spy parody with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has become customary now to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British twist and this seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English’s action comedy, which began in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English – The Rebirth.
Will the veiled self-irony on the subject of how much crap we do be the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, incompetent rubber-faced Johnny English and eyes out of orbit got his license to mess things up for the second time – and his name indicates more than anything that it’s a comedic creation developed for non-English-speaking moviegoers’ countries.
Obviously it is the silly secret agent who despite his strange claims of glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind that contributed with a single note to the theme moments of Glory at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is a character initially based on the traveler and mysterious international man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest Johnny English release.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing medieval armor and the propellers briefly rattle against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humor seems rather undersized and strangely superfluous, particularly now that brands of “serious” movies like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems aimed at children rather than adults and to me Johnny English’s crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson’s silent films when he plays Mr Bean.
The immutable premise now is that Britain is in serious danger.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the dismay of the agent in charge, a sadly very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that makes the vase overflow for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Teresa-like character May but there’s not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisor informs her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to call back someone who has already retired.
And this means that the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a school principal in a chic establishment, but who also gives lessons in an unofficial way on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a spying course like School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin's disasters for Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously into the net of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by smuggling into Volta's luxury yacht and English creates pure anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality mask to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as kind and exuberant as it is, there is quite a bit of children’s TV throughout the story.
The whole thing is quite modest.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: couldn’t the British film industry assign Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies it is working on a plan for British workers to work four days a week but be paid for five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, despite being paid for five.
The party would like major companies to transfer the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an extra day off.
This way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend while maintaining the same pay.
Some sources said the idea would be compatible with the party's economic program and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The shift to a four-day day was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, a revision of the policy line is expected."
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, given that the Green Party promised a four-day working week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
In any case, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not part of the party’s political line and is not currently the subject of discussion.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless leaders” and “speculators” in businesses for public services.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also imply that current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour government could implement “deductions” based on behavior deemed illicit.
It also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create inclusive equity funds, so as to transfer 10 percent of private sector companies’ net worth to employees, who end up pocketing annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises questions about whether the government agency’s findings can influence some of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview airing Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to bring to light something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said that while I was on my way to the hearing,” I said, “I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what had happened, that that accusation had come out, I said, 'Did you do it?'
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's vote, however, seems carved into the rock.
“I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could stand up to a bomb-proof charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett energetically denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever she names couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new in change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a remarkable lineup of stars and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pour into the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But exactly, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way of persuading people to call for action, or is it just another example of so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel they really make a difference by simply signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters, working for a variety of different purposes.
These actions have helped to urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, intended to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that protected capital funds have so far had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives based in the UK, committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” with a promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website, which asked, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and arduous journey – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of those who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to implement "blockade" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can, “if necessary,” resort to its own Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in Syria – particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe,” he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to cope with it.
“The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not put on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the defendants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
“The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “unversatile,” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, which for European consumers is by far the cheapest option.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of Nord Stream 2, a “inappropriate” pipeline project that Trump said made Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the 11-billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to double the capacity of the existing one to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin objects that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, the U.S. Secretary of Energy.
The U.S. stance has sparked a backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of European Union energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I see it as a big problem that a third state is interfering with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to take ‘serious consideration’ of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren on Saturday said she would consider running for president following the midterm elections.
At a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for president.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and set up our messy government, and that means having a woman at the top,” he said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
During the town hall Warren said his own about President Donald Trump, declaring that he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, whom he appointed to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “It’s natural that we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
A poll released Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run in 2020.
58 percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not compete, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent opposing.
Other names of high-profile Democrats discussed about a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after coming back, I can relate him to other families experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a narcotics firearm, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia Support the Challenge for New Asylum Policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday presented a memoir amicus curiae in Washington to support an asylum seeker who contested the policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and her violent gang children" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate vast numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing rampant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed an asylum application to undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, District Attorney Karl Racine said the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of particular circumstances and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates that principle,” the amicus curiae memoir states.
In the memo, prosecutors also objected that the policy banning immigrants harms the U.S. economy, stating the clear likelihood that they will become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is accessible to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fears due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or a political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11, as part of the announcement of the policy line.
Asylum has never been designed to alleviate every problem -- even every serious problem -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate recovery attempts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more desperate.
“There is a lot of tension,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her feverish little baby at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“At any moment there is an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching among their sordid personal belongings, in an attempt to recover whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who was the victim of a shoulder and back fracture, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to continued heavy aftershocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted the feeling of the violent earthquake that shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
“I was crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Burning Bullying’ with ‘Advertising Propaganda’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper advertising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to make propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referenced the China Daily's paid announcement in the Des Moines Register - the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation that China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election highlighted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase of an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war that has seen them adjust their tariffs to their respective imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and formerly longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “now increases that arrogance by publishing advertising propaganda in our free newspapers.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s beloved tradition of freedom of speech and press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Vice-versa, in the newsstand on the road here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese population might have on China’s problematic economic trajectory, given that the media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has evaded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not state what newspaper it was.
Republicans are alienating women’s electorate ahead of midterm elections in Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Given that many leading Republicans defend the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and are on his side in dealing with various allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have signaled that there will be a negative reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Unrest in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
“You can’t take these things back,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan “November is coming!” during their protest in the Senate room, when Republicans who control the Judiciary Commission chose to continue Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats is skyrocketing,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they were already tall; it’s true.
But they could be taller, especially among undecided suburban electricians and young voters, ages 18 to 29, who often don’t vote despite not liking the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had speculated that a negative reaction could have occurred if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
“For the GOP it has become a confusing whole,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the vote for the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it’s also about how Republicans handled the situation and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
In any case, Americans seem to be somewhat divided between the person they believe in following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they certainly or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believe Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the allegations brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals during a party during his studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that draws its origins from the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intent behind Inrupt is “dominating the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online storage of personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, is to bring the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to bring their own decentralized apps to life using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not tell Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely messed up overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to procure commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the Ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Church of England ecclesiastic to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
The lieutenant colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, obtained recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren inaugurated a memorial plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and the war machines".
Then he hurried to the line of fire and with the "greatest gallantry" advanced the line before he ran with a single-handed cannon and landed three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never live up to and something that makes me humbler.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "really honored to play a part in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by so many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to then be denied the vision of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including the six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stumped when Peppa Pig appeared on screen.
Some remained grounded after staying awake until the early hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter, a fan described the move to children's cartoons as "some kind of bad-tempered joke".
“Government regulations say that content was no longer appropriate at six in the morning, so we had to switch to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," "yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said: “We will be working on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“But there it is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when he changed schedule there were a lot of messages coming in and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We’ll limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally do – and we’ve been trying to get so much for the fans, and we’ve just discussed it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" due to sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality - but this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he got to high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on the first installment of Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also stated that having become a parent made it less important to him to win the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the long-standing program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months off for illness.
Presenting himself as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else growing up because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
He said, "These days, the feeling of feeling less of, and feeling different, was the things that really gave me the strength and energy to be successful."
She wanted to try to be “something,” she said, so she wouldn’t let anyone down if they just happened to find out about her sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at this year’s Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man — American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “was a surprise to me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you pass so many at a young age” — he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June, to a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “whole perspective” has changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that I had to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be around so I can be in the front row, Dad,'” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I still didn’t realize he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
"I just knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which had a particular significance for him in preparation for the Olympics and still makes him look goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out-of-form Mickelson put on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get back in shape to prevent it from becoming an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the two-year event for the twelfth time on record, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what haunts him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the bumpy course regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the course itself wasn't daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth game, is facing the careful British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of their 12 singles matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson’s match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
“He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the shoulder, put his arm around me and said he’ll be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It’s a Hall of Famer and it’s added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s the way it went and that’s the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never even remotely mirrored the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought intangibles to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the meeting room,” she explained.
“I also think the younger players had a lot of fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He has done so much more than play.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon vanish.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable lead in individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable run.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama in which the team, led by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point gap from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimal lead, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I keep saying to myself that we had a good lead in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but little,” Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
“The story will prove to me and my team that it’s not over.
Tomorrow we have to give our best.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It is not over until the points are scored on the whiteboard.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who’s on the other side: the best golfers in the world.”
Happy with the way his team competed on that tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have outdone myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It’s nice to be there with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re just your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message that you need to convey to the players: tomorrow, you have to bring out the best in yourself.
Then you forget about your partner because he too has to go there and bring out the best in himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look to his players for the best individual performance rather than team performance, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those big games of the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing to the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the lead on the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start immediately on the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain fold, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way that we think is appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said of his selection for the individual matches.
Germany's new military ship has been postponed again
According to local media, the last frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the times of the Cold War, but it will not be there at least until next year due to faulty systems and a surge in costs.
The commission of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling post-delivery issues tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic markings.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continued delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will already become obsolete when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate Type F-125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to Hamburg’s Blohm & Voss shipyard.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media noted a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that made the ship useless when employed on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors, barely half the staff of the older Bremen-class ships.
In addition, it emerged that the ship weighs significantly too much, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) since the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involving the new frigates are becoming of particular importance in the light of the recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the Navy actually "lacks ships capable of being employed".
The official said the issue has worsened considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ones.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research at a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal how bats use their sight to procure food.
It is hoped that the findings can shed light on the behavior of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats, as well as brown eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be positioned in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of the calls of the bats and the way each species behaves.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and how to best maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Bats are at risk due to construction and development work affecting trespoli and ruining habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as musk paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to attacks from domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to grabbing a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to spot insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the trespoli and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland’s first bat-only reserve at Threave Estate in the Dumfries and Galloway region, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory.
“Here at Threave we have a vast area for bats,” he said.
“We have ancient buildings, many centuries-old trees and a good habitat.
But there’s a lot about bats that we don’t know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs.”
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before conducting maintenance inside the properties as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single maternal trespole could kill up to 400 females and young, perhaps wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their moths.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges as lawyers sue German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo labeled the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to advertise themselves” with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel on Friday also announced the charge of paying $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
In an Instagram video directed to his 142 million followers, in the hours following the accusations, Ronaldo, 33, cut off the statements as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false,” says the five-time Golden Ball staring at the camera.
“They want to advertise themselves through my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by doing my name, but this is part of the game.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” added the footballer smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s attorneys are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call “an inadmissible report of suspicions in the private sphere.”
The lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages to the extent corresponding to the severity of the breach of privacy, considered, probably, one of the most serious of personal rights in recent years."
The event took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he subjected her to anal violence, according to statements filed with the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo would have gotten down on his knees after the incident, saying he was “99 percent” a “good guy” disappointed by “one percent.”
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sex, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also said she went to the police and the hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation agreement as she felt "terrified by retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now trying to overturn the deal, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he will join Italian Juventus on a €100 million contract.
Brexit: the UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "could regret forever" the loss of its status as a world leader in car manufacturing following Brexit, said Industry Minister Greg Clark.
He also said he was "concerned" by Toyota UK's statements to the BBC about Britain's possible exit from the EU without a deal and the resulting temporary shutdown of production at the plant in Burnston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Minister Clark.
The Japanese automaker claims that delays at the borders, in the case of a no-deal Brexit, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which houses the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s general manager in Burnaston.
There is growing concern among other British automakers about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern is the risks in the supply chain encountered by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on the basis of the “just in time” concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from British and European suppliers for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, border inconveniences could result in delays and a shortage of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day’s worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely thought out to avoid these border inconveniences.”
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us to not only enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop but, in the long run, warns that the additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the plant’s trade union delegates, states that the workers are greatly concerned: “In my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reinstated.”
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed further, the White House says.
Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by a week,” as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference in the election, the ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the president’s possible impediment to justice.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy justice minister, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Over the course of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But on Monday, he went to the White House and was rumored to be resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Wednesday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of FBI investigation of questions against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There hasn’t been a date set, it could be this week, I guess it’s going to be another week considering everything that’s going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press.”
Some journalists may dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders said the lack of briefings is not due to an aversion to television journalists “showing up,” although he said: “I don’t disagree with the fact that they show up.”
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
“The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him,” he said, adding without citing evidence: “We checked the figures.”
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it, as in recent weeks, and this will replace the briefings with the press and you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, perhaps, the president proved his reason by giving a speech that was free-wheeling, and at the same time bizarre, in front of a group of journalists.
Health Minister writes to Scottish NHS European workers to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the NHS of Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months ahead of the UK’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to meet the costs of applying for settled status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: “Throughout the summer there have been continuous negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to the autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring invaluable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of healthcare services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we very much wish you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie was operated on following a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31-27, Mike Organ of The Tennessee newspaper reported.
Chief Technical Officer Rod Reed told reporters that the incident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He approached the edge of the field and passed out," Reed said.
First responders and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field, before putting it on the stretcher and taking it away for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "we still have no word on the type and extent of the damage" and that the Tennessee States are trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with the Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five tackles before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to new Labour plans.
The maneuver will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The stamp tax increase will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Department plans to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The stamp tax increase will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional resources will support the Government's initiative to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which adds to the current stamp duty, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let real estate, could amount to more than 3%.
The Treasury expects the manoeuvre to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the state.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson had requested a stamp tax cut to help younger people with the purchase of the first home.
He accused big construction firms of keeping real estate prices high by grabbing land without using it, and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up affordable housing quotas to fix Britain’s “real estate misfortune.”
MEP Corbyn has announced a blatant series of proposals for housing market reform, including rent controls and the culpable elimination of evictions.
It also wants to give the council greater powers over the construction of the new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year I said I would be committed to re-establishing the British dream that life should be better for new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if buying a home were equally easy for people who do not reside in the UK and for foreign companies, as it is for British resident workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland Technical Director Jack Ross says his "greatest aspiration" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old is drawn to the challenge of lifting the Northeast team, which is currently third in the League One, three points from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren during last season’s Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I've been in Serie B and that's it," Ross told the BBC's Sportsound programme.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it is something I will always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as manager of a team.”
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach claims he feels no anxiety about following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League.”
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I think I’ll succeed only if I can get the team back on track.”
Ross’s managerial career began three years ago, after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a replacement coach for the Hearts.
He then helped the Alloa save themselves from relegation to the third tier and led St. Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his football career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
“I really believed that the role of manager was made for me, more than the role of player.
It seems strange because I worked well, made a living and had some good results.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with weekly.
I still face them in terms of work stress and pressure but the management seems good.
I’ve always wanted to direct and now I do, I feel a lot calmer than I’ve ever been in my life.”

According to a study, the right time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday
The summer heatwave has led to higher revenues for struggling British pubs and more concern for catering services.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, a commercial consulting firm, put the data together and commented: “The persistence of the sun and England’s long stay at the World Cup meant that the month of July followed a similar path to the month of June, when pubs were above 2.8 percent, while restaurants were hit hardest.
The 1.8 percent decline in catering in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which most people drink were the most solid, with a homogeneous increase greater than the decrease of restaurants.
Even the pubs where you eat have suffered the heat, although not too much like the restaurateurs.
It seems people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and managed bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent in the month, while food consumption fell three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly burdensome in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurateurs and only the weather will be able to tell if the more moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce.
Global sales growth among pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand roll-outs.
Sales monitoring company Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants gathers and analyzes performance data across 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry reference company.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11 years old, has secret accounts on social networks that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake” Instagram pages
The news has heightened the fear that sexual content will be posted
20 percent of students said they have a “main” account to show to parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates accounts on social networks that keep adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake” accounts on Instagram, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they managed a "main" account cleaned up to show to parents, while keeping a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site by chance found a teenage girl urging others to “rape me.”
The research, from the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of private schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping their accounts private.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces in which parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘Voice for Athletes’ at Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Board during the Scottish Athletics Board's National General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in athletics, and President Ian Beattie described the nomination as a great opportunity for sport managers to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has deep respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that in Scotland athletics could benefit enormously by bringing her to the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, and currently a BBC commentator, found herself unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job but I recovered completely, he learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
The advertising of a breast pump compares mothers and cows and divides opinion online
A breastfeeding company has divided opinion online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers and cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is referred to as the “world’s first silent and wearable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an advertisement in the form of playful music video to show the freedom to express themselves as mothers given by the new breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, “Yes, I take my milk but I don’t have one thing” and “If I hadn’t noticed, these aren’t breasts but my tits.”
The choir continues: "Take it out, take it out, feed the children, take it out, take it out, take the milk out to my ladies."
However, the advertisement, posted on the company’s Facebook pages, caused controversy on the net.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked different reactions among viewers, many of whom claimed it highlighted the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“An unhappy decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must also become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen a few days after birth.”
The Elvie breast pump wears discreetly under a mother's bra
Someone else commented: "Understandably traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for moms who will continue to keep their babies?”
Someone else added, “It’s really meaningless advertising.”
Others have defended her and a woman has even admitted to finding the song "fun".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If you were still breastfeeding, I wish I had one.
When I used the breast pump, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irreverent but it doesn’t go far from reality.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another person commented, “This is a fun advertisement dedicated to moms who use breast pumps (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like ‘cows.’”
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
In the end the protagonists of the video show that they have danced with the discreet breast pump inserted in the bra.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvie breast pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be tucked into a breastfeeding bra giving women the freedom to move, hold babies and even get out while pulling milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who use breast pumps to cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast pump is able to ensure.”
This isn't the first time that Elvie's breast pump made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children showed up on the catwalk of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policy stance have made it more difficult for these children to be placed in custody.
Most of those who took them into custody were usually illegal immigrants who now fear to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by offering to do so.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential custodians and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had offered to take care of children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Almost 80% of people who offer to take care of children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are criminal foreigners.
So we’re continuing to hunt these people down,” Albence said.
To try to prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules whereby some of them will have to appear in court within a month of arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to those working at reception points.
Many will appear in videoconference instead of in person, to plead their case of legal status with an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit for help will be expelled quickly.
The longer children stay in foster care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent fits of anger or escape attempts, according to those working at shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the probability of this happening is even higher in a large structure such as the one in Tornillo where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for the signs of discomfort of children to be ignored.
They add that moving children into the tent town without giving them time to emotionally prepare or greet friends could aggravate the trauma many are already facing.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home even though the war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces illegally occupy Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to “fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and support Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions are favorable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "instilling unfounded fears" that push refugees away from their homeland.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should be just a humanitarian problem is politicized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be allocated to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created the opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has averted an extended attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters of the al-Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, which "will be uprooted".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will win his second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may hope, his presidency does not have to end prematurely because of an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential final ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of a decline in viewers.
Since 2014, first-night percentages have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the early evening, up significantly from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed the network’s percentages by reaching 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with the most important news.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s not something that can be explained,” says Neal Baer, showrunner for ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
It reminds of a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He replied, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television show, the plot of Washington’s events can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite or not, and the health of the global economy.
Stopping to follow the news is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond their duty as informed citizens to find themselves following for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s in-depth research for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment full of bravado” commented The Washington Post) and the implications of Trump’s disgusting descriptions of the parties.
I won’t be able to watch Super Mario without thinking about it.
“Part of the reason why what he does looks like a reality show is that there’s news every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars,” about the actors’ alternation and daily developments in the Trump show’s plot (as opposed to N.F.L. praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, or you'll be left behind.
This week I went to see Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in the house watching MSNBC and was recording CNN.
He failed to break away from television, not as Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Judiciary Committee and the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented, “I remember when we used to do all those nonsensical programs and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.’
“I thought it was a joke, but they were right.”

Inflow of external money in the race for the tightest midterm elections
It is no surprise that the 17th district is experiencing an influx of money thanks to the realignment of a congressional district that has caused two current members to run for the same seat.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburg brings in Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district during a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race to the 17th district sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a sizable victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That place had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought to penalize El Salvador because it supports China, then changed their mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather cordial meeting took place between Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization leadership group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to bring back heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the decision to impose sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the Americans for drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been worrying for the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and murderers.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September senior management officials clarified that they intended to continue with the conference, thus definitively waiving any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further reprimands or punishments from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, anonymously, about the internal decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who wanted to remain anonymous anyway.
Study the history
In his report, special counsel Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, which appears to be sufficient evidence.
Mueller’s investigation aims to shed light on Trump’s possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress were to pass on to Democrats, Trump would have to respond to these accusations in front of voters and perhaps a jury of his peers as he prepares for a new candidacy.
The unknowns are many and I do not intend to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as is that of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
On that occasion we failed to miss the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans have to deal with different issues at the moment.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s position has been complicated since this newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested intercepting Trump and questioning his ability to serve as president.
Rosenstein claims the news in The Times is not true.
“How will we react if the FBI’s new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it will be upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to answer for his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we will make it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such a legacy, I can only be optimistic about the future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them excellent opportunities to qualify for the Group G of the Europa League.
Although due to a knee injury midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season right on the occasion of a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, he believes this result can allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went through the game convinced we were doing well and we brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents got a good result in the last game, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not be disappointed.
“Last year was certainly difficult because of my injuries and changes at the club level but now the feeling is positive.
The team is in good shape, the guys have fun and the preparation goes well.
So we can forget about last season’s problems and think about the future.”
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term care
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of care they would like to receive, few have addressed the topic in the family.
Approximately half of Nationwide respondents say they have talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% say they have talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide, “People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t face this conversation.”
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children about it: you can’t prepare your family to assist you if you don’t communicate in time what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide together with him and your family members where and how you want to receive care, because these factors can be determinant for the costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he will be able to advise you on how to pay the expenses you will face.
Choosing a long-term care loan may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy with redemption value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for the insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all the necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can oversee medical care and make sure the professionals meet your wishes in case you were unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a power of attorney for your finances.
You will be able to choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid in case you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the details: imagine your elderly parent being rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information down in detail so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just a question of finances, but who are the doctors?” asks Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be prepared for any eventuality.”
Man repeatedly shot with a compressed-air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed-air rifle while returning home on foot after spending the evening outside.
The victim, a 40-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "random action".
The victim did not see his attacker.
He is not in any danger of life and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died following a very strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The death toll is set to rise.
Communications have been cut off and rescuers have been unable to get any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood for the economy of Central Sulawesi province and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone known as the Pacific Fire Belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries along the Indian Ocean coast, killing 226,000 people, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hurled against the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
There were more than 1,100 victims.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charge
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska’s former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting the arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she ripped her phone from her hand.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his bail was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the TV network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "certainly innocent".
Palin risks being charged with three first-degree offences, namely imprisonment for up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a second-degree offence punishable by one day’s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstruction of reporting the crime, and possession of a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder following his time in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people died after the earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications network are not working and the death toll is set to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi which is located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the town of Palu.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Extraordinary Death Penalty for NYC Terror Attack Suspects
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the perpetrator of the terrorist attack that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has never been imposed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to plunge onto a bike path along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under the conditions for the death penalty in the southern district of New York, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and equally “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts that included eight counts of murder with criminal association, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “real planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
The preliminary notice states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, offense and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York prosecuted the last death penalty case.
The man, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and charged with passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they were proud of what they did in front of investigators.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he had decided to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As for the 22 counts, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting an acknowledgment of guilt and a life sentence without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s group of defenders had previously urged prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory says NIGEL FARAGE must lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of Theresa May’s party parliamentarians suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK’s Independence Party said politicians must “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone told Birmingham that the UK would “already be out of Europe” if Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges that May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party have been underscored by the Tories in favor of staying in Europe who took part in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The prime minister is trying to enforce the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
The Allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective backlash, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and “chaos.”
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that Farage should be entrusted with the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels.
“By this time we would be out of Europe,” he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: “I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan.”
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country.”
Bone rejected the view that public opinion would change since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in Europe is completely false.”
Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit supporter, also attended the parade and told reporters: “I simply tell the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who go around the streets in search of votes to allow us to be elected.
Let go of the Chequers Plan and start listening.”
In an incisive message to May, he added: “Prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises.”
At the summit, Farage said politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they were going to betray the decision made with the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we won’t allow it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the people’s army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, those in favor of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of activists pushed the Tory against Brexit flags after the group formed this weekend.
The Labour leader mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and for borderless commerce in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a city assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The assumption that he could challenge Trump in 2020 was in the air long ago.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she would like to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington to fix the government and that implies a woman to hold the highest office.”
Arrest for the murder of the LSU Sims player
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday, he released a video of the murder asking for help in identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to his head that killed him,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247Sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the crime scene possessing a weapon and having struck Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
A junior player of almost two meters who grew up in Baton Rouge, last season Sims played 32 games including 10 as a starter with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately apparent that the Mercedes team’s orders would heavily condition the race.
From pole, Bottas started well leaving Hamilton to defend against Vettel’s attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stopped first at the pits, leaving Hamilton in the tail traffic of the group, a move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes makes the next lap by returning to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtakes him after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tries to prevent his passage inside risking to end up outside after a double shift to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first lap he is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for much of the race without stopping at the pits for the tyre change and tries to finish quickly to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to take fourth place.
In the end, however, he has to make the pit stop on the 44th lap and in the remaining 8 laps he is not able to increase the pitch and overcome Raikkonen, who comes fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri worked really well all weekend and was really nice to let me through.
The team has done an outstanding job to get first and second place,” Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence on not disclosing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “bad, mean and lying.”
"What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, bad and lying," he said.
“When there are obvious signs that the news is being divulged and the perpetrators say, ‘Oh no, it wasn’t me.
I could never do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Do you remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn’t,” she added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion was leaked from his office.
“I didn’t hide Professor Ford’s allegations, but I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did."
But his denial is not credible for the president, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but this is the worst example of body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of attempted sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using these accusations for their own purposes.
“They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the wickedness. They don't care who they harm, who they have to pass over to regain power and control," the president said, according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two Giants goals against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday’s defeat in the Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 comeback race in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately took advantage of two shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to the draw before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard scored a draw for the Dundees before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen declared their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who had come back on Friday night in Belfast and won the game with the Dundees 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the 3:35 minute on Kendall McFaull's assist, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assist.
In what was a fairly lively first half, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt provided the draw assist to Cownie at the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer decreed the advantage for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team repackaged and Bouchard regained the tie after a strategic 27:37 minute maneuver.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that brought the Dundees to the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and decreed his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who at this point have lost four of the last five games, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he dies to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off and save them.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing due to a very strong earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of Palu's fearfully swinging Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He wanted to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This is really sad news for us,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of casualties could reach thousands and the national disaster countermeasures agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is set to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many more,” said Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything it can to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army men: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related activities.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims missing after lagoon accident
The airline of the flight that fell in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board among passengers and crew members had managed to escape, now claims that there is one missing.
According to Air Niugini news, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing from the appeal.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats rescued other passengers and crew after the crash occurred while the plane was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline says six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Witnesses say the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very low altitude.
“And it was really a fortune,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and yelled and that he was slightly hit in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to fix a pier provided relief using a dinghy to transport people to the shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that in the past two decades 111 people have died in plane crashes on PNG-registered airlines but none of these have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst Reconstructs the Night of the Burning Woman
Saturday ended the presentation of evidence in the new trial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have retrieved location data from several cellphones that show that, contrary to what she said, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claims to have been with friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford’s truck that night, the latter confirmed that he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
The cell phone data indicates that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to pass to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting positive messages into their songs.
Bristol-based group The High Breed argues that hip-hop moved away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to their origins and do a conscious kind of hip-hop again.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York City nanny sues a couple for firing her with a "racist" text
In New York, a nanny sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text in which the mother complained that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist by comparing the request to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "embarrassed" fired Ms. Maurice saying she was unhappy with their previous nanny, an African-American, and that she expected a Filipino.
He paid Ms. Maurice the day's work and sent her home with a cab.
Maurice sued the couple and, for being fired, she is seeking a beauty compensation of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she had initially been hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want them to understand that they can’t behave like that,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by stating that Maurice’s dismissal was the only thing to do as they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent her a message saying something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“Would you entrust your children to a person with whom you have been rude, even if by mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had just given birth two months ago and is in a "very difficult situation".
“You can’t be angry with a person like that.
It’s not very kind behavior,” the financial advisor added.
While the lawsuit is still pending, the public opinion court immediately denounced the spouses on social media criticizing them harshly for their behavior and the logic followed.
A letter reveals that the publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not like a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter as follows: "It's not easy to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It’s fun now that we know Paddington’s great success.”
Claiming that his father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the toy bear-inspired children’s book, would not have reacted well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was a bit “sad” after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father was modestly proud of his success.
“He was a fairly quiet man, not a presumptuous person,” he says.
“But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like having a child who reaches a goal: you’re proud of it even if it’s not your credit.
I think he interpreted Paddington’s success this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed credit to Paddington himself.
I had to say goodbye to the phone to my daughter who was dying
On landing her daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter would not make it,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then she called me to tell me she was going to die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly waning.
She died a while ago and it was the end.
I had to sit back and wait knowing this was happening.
I couldn’t complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
“No one knew that,” he says.
“All the time I’ve been crying with my head down.
It’s hard to explain, but while on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two women mourning tickets to prevent suicides on deck
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide work to prevent others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she says.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said he lit up every room he went into.”
But before he died, he quit his job because depression had taken him “to a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there'll be a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can turn to to talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don’t have to isolate themselves, they have to talk.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
“You never said he felt down or depressed,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
The Christmas day hit the bottom. When the children opened the presents, he avoided looking them in the eyes. "
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to work out: "He tore the family apart.
He tore us apart.
But we had to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future Uncertain: FBI Begins Investigation
“I think if we could proceed as he asked, that is, with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “losing its cool” due to the blockade of entrenched supporters.
Why doesn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left in the midterm elections on November 6. If the Republicans as expected get a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to get the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court elected.
George W. Bush called the senators by pushing to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes its report?
The Senate is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the delays and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of political refugees 'decreases' with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge from South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, says refugees were 1,127 last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are a tighter control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs demanded by those who illegally exit these people.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal emigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearisation negotiations that are stalling.
This follows the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to collaborate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. sanctions for lack of development since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security and in such circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed with unilateral disarmament first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit for the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not character-appropriate for that job.
Pelosi gave this opinion Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I think if a woman had behaved in the same way, they would have called her hysterical,” Pelosi said of Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Visibly thrilled, Kavanaugh denied the allegation of sexually harassing Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the grip of emotion, so much so that he almost screamed and his throat was weeping as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned committee Democrats who called the charges against him an “absurd and coordinated smear campaign” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has proven to be biased against Democrats.
“I think he’s self-excluded with his statements and the way he talked about the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh in the event he was confirmed and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I think if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only is it not suitable for the Supreme Court, but also not for the court that presides now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a Court of Appeals judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh evaded questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said: “You cannot send a hysterical and biased person to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be welcomed in a positive way.”
And women have to use it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of fits of anger that he can't get out of without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And she went on, "A woman who was a manager somewhere helped me a lot. She told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she had developed a technique so when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it went on.
I thought yours was a brilliant idea.”
Tears are tolerated as an outflow of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office dates back to when I once cried over an outburst of anger. An older woman, a cold manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified, took me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't ever see yourself crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they have you in their hands.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his run for president.
In 1987, when Hart's extramarital affair was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business, and she had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she shouldn't try herself to run for president.
“It wasn’t really a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing about 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and we definitely didn’t need another one.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with the fundraiser and swore she would not run if she hadn’t raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause at the start.
She found that some of the supporters who had given the male candidates $1,000 to her would only give her $250.
“Do they think I can get a discount?” he asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, disappointment at the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger at the sexual discrimination she was a victim of), that she was moved.
“It looked like I was in the grip of a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled thinking about the reaction of the press.
“Somebody might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
Maybe "You're crying a lot."
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening blows of the U.S.-China trade war have been roaring, and while the battle is far from over, experts say a clash between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump has already issued the first warning this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new duties on items worth more than $200 billion, meaning that taxes will be levied on half of the goods of Chinese origin.
Beijing has reacted each time with measures of the same kind, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. blow-by-blow and the world’s second-largest economic power is unlikely to soon back down.
For Washington to give up, it would be necessary to give in to its demands, but to bow publicly to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts, however, believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US can positively affect China in the long run by diminishing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create the initial conditions for an economic collapse in both countries is in fact far more dangerous than what has been recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In front of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million still living in Syria are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any aid conditionally or from those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europa team won the 2018 Ryder Cup beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points that were needed to beat the United States.
U.S. champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water at the 16th hole of par 3 conceding victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his rounds becoming one of four players ever to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was played for the first time in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in the ranking Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, surrendered for 2&1 to the English Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia, who played eight, became the European player who won the most in the tournament’s history with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It’s a victory for the team and I’m happy to have made my contribution,” said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the baton to fellow golfer John Ram who beat U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods with a 2&1 singles score on Sunday.
“If I think I grew up watching his games, I’m really very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now counts his Ryder Cup games to 13 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think he is one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been looking for fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: “I’m proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europa team.
We've thrown away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed very well.
I'm going to work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We put it all together.
They played better than us.”
Red tide update: concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decrease in red tide concentration in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patchy flowering conditions, which suggest a decrease in concentration, are evident in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
The red tide flowering stretches for about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The patches are located about 10 miles off Hillsborough County but in fewer areas than last week.
The red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week an average concentration in Pinellas County or off its coasts, a concentration from low to high off Hillsborough County, from a background concentration to a low concentration in Manatee County, from a background concentration to a high concentration in Sarasota County or off its coasts, from a background concentration to an average concentration in Charlotte County, from a background concentration to a background concentration in Charlotte County, was reported.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No cases were reported in northwest Florida last week.
