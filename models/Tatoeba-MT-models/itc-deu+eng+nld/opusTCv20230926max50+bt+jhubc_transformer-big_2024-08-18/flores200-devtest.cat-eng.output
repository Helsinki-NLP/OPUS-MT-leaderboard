This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but offers details that fossils normally cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
. Scientists say that the feather of this animal was brownish brown at the top with a light-colored or carotenoid background.
The finding also provides an insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed cannon, called a rachis, but do have other characteristics of bearded and bearded feathers, researchers deduce that the rachis was surely a more recent evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used to fly but to regulate temperature or to exhibit themselves. Researchers have suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample presents the plumage of an adult and not a chicken.
The researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not plumage.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the Gaziantep police headquarters in Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.

They have discovered that the Sun worked under the same basic principles as other stars: it has been found that the activity of all the stars in the system depends on their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used at the same time to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be with respect to magnetic inversions.

The work done has been mostly theoretical, but the program has been written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, which causes the tides, the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects another dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.

Infrared images show variations in daytime and nighttime temperatures that show that they are probably caves.
They are cooler than the surface surrounding them during the day, and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not stable like large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but is consistent with the hypothesis that they are deep holes in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, the elections have traditionally been a not-so-technological experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper with the candidate they have chosen.
After those responsible verify the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot sheet.
The French electoral law strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can be witnesses that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added other than those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to testify to each part of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strong supervision, following specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, “We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have recovered her cellphone and her computer.”
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendant appeared in court with his face covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was relocated to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Sheriff's Court of Scotland charged with the murder of her son.
He is pending indictment and trial, but any visual testimony could be rejected because his image has been published everywhere.
This is a practice common to any other place in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “journalists appear to be walking a dangerous line if they post photos, etc. of the suspects.”
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the charges, has told reporters it will not make further statements, at least until the verdict.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to establish according to the pre-war borders of the Middle East in 1967.
Among the other matters dealt with are the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for 10 years once an agreement has been signed, while the PA only commits to accept it for five years.
Hunters on the supplemental pest control pilot test had to be closely monitored by the forest rangers, as the pilot test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In an association of NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooters Association (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Hunting Association program of the Sports Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the interim director of the Conservation and Heritage Park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received adequate safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in to a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures aimed at advancing the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of elections, some of them scheduled for 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of malfunction and overheating of iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing fewer than four people to be burned.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple’s postponement of the report “unfortunately frankly.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office has said no damage has been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there had been no tsunami signals.
A former Philippine policeman has been holding Hong Kong tourists hostage for kidnapping his bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages have recently been released, including children and elders, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an old lady, who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Hospital for Women in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature birth during his spare time.
Their research showed that if a hormone was administered, the fetal lung maturation of the baby would accelerate.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two “black boxes” of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fighting companions have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Moon was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Moon died the night of two moons. Pretty unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels has commented that "Moon was as freaky as me...it can be even more...I love her and I'll find her at the altar...I hope she finds herself in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people questioned before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of respondents want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the gold medal at the Olympics was to swim in the 100 and 200 metres and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical fitness has been questioned due to his complaints.
He has not been able to take the necessary medications to cope with his pains because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number discovered as of January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water sent to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his rule earlier this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political chatter and bastards."
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology unlike older ground-based radar technology so that traffic controllers locate pilots much more accurately and send them more accurate information.
Reinforcement of transport is not contemplated and surface trains will not stop at Wembley; at street level there are also no car parks or link parking lots.
The concern of a lack of transport has made us think of the possibility that the game must be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was thought to take much longer for this process, due to the crossing between a Darwin pine tree, Geospiza fortes (endemic), and a Gal<0xC3><0xA1>pagos pine tree with a spike Geoconic.
Gold can be worked in all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into smaller figures.
It can be inserted into thin threads, which can be twisted. It can be beaten or flattened into sheets.
It can be very thin and stacked on other metals. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images of books called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a substance. You can make yourself an indicator using cranberry juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the pH H) in the analyzed substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with wet clean hands, make a ball of them.
The moisture in the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of occasional public bathhouses where men and women met in joint company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and our sight.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an amazing way. The most notable fact that the wheel has made for us has been to make transportation much faster and easier.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felids (including asylvestrated domestic cats) that eat small prey that are far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche, a special work that each cat has and that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called flocks.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males with up to thirty females and puppies.
Females are often intimately related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave largely like dolphins or wolf herds, which are animals with behavior surprisingly similar to that of lions (although not to that of other large felids) and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances and push with 5 times the strength of a forced human.
The tiger is from the same group (genus panther) of lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felids are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase called words of anger.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than him.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals that are eaten (taken) with the smell, summing up the traces they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with the environment and then scurrying over their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main and original group (e.g., crossing a mountain range or a river, or migrating to a new island and unable to go back) they will often find themselves in an environment different from what they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations from those it needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe and take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, we exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also shade.
We build our homes with plants and make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat are plants. Without plants, most animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of his time, which is why he was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than seventy sharpened teeth like knives, accompanied by an additional play in the sky of his mouth, so that there was no escape for anything that stood in his way.
We don’t know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, long fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could rival him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a few rare or unusual products at their banquets; such as wild boars, peacocks, snails and some rodents called lilies.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women sat in a chair, rich men liked to participate in banquets where they snuggled together as they ate.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that had arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted a turkey rooster.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the chaplains tried to cover the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary that only chaplains could access.
Sometimes special tower-shaped pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
Most of Jewish family life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters looking out onto the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Eric the Red went into exile from Iceland because of a murder and, traveling west, discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
However, despite their discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that behind the Declaration of Independence there’s a treasure map.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written behind the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its creation the long parchment (293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up to store it.
Thus, it seems that the notation was added simply as a label.
D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by Vichy France. These were Frenchmen who had signed peace with the Germans in 1940 and who collaborated with the invaders instead of facing Shi.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
Within just two weeks, the Americans and the French Free Forces had liberated southern France and advanced into Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by an important group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also somewhat defines the dimensions of society.
City-states preceded nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and an equitable spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without obvious historical traces and are not recognized as civilizations themselves.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government with Congress being their only component under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on the state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles needed the unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended, and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often abstained.
The national football team of Italy, with the national football team of Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most well-known sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, skate hockey and F1 motorsport.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and feature the presence of Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands Japan has, we often call it, in geographical terms, an "archipelago"
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors coined for the island the name of Formosa Island, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, where it began the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and turned to Chinese workers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common frame format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size at the close of the analogue film era.
It still occurs today, but more importantly: its aspect ratio has been inherited in the sensor formats of digital imaging cameras.
The 35 mm format creates, in fact, a bit of confusion, with 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same or closely related to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period European history was questioned by the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s money funds exist precisely for this reason.
The main authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder if this dogma was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire segments of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at the last job he had) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different historical epochs: each stage of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
Also between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms epoch that took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Equally after the Revolution, the occupations were opened to all men who requested it by allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve it.
This also applies to the military, because instead of basing army ranks on classes, from that point on they were based on relevance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people of the repressed working class in other countries to start their revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that go beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that would be known as "Hira" in the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a fairly clear picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
At the top of 1 of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, and even knowing its existence, it is not at all easy to find. Isolation is absolute once you get inside the cave.
Nothing can be seen except a serene and beautiful sky overhead, and the abundant mountains that surround it. There is very little of this world that can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Gizeh Necropolis", in the Egyptian Valley of Death contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and minor temples were erected in honor of Pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "bow up" sign resembles the letter V (see below) and the "bow down" sign resembles a staple or square without the bottom side.
When it appears upwards it means that you have to start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and when it is downwards it means that you have to start at the heel (which is where your hand holds the bow) and stretch the bow downwards.
Rubbing the strings from right to left generates a softer sound, while doing it the other way around produces a stronger, assertive sound.
Take the liberty of writing down your own directions, but keep in mind that bow marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, her two young sons (Mary Teresa, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a multitude of women merchants to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and waving threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to bring the carriage windows fully open.
At one point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a royal guard murdered at Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The wartime expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime, to cover much of the expenses and interest on floating bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great gains derived from the prolonged exploitation of Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars one must understand the context that promoted the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is popularly known as the Full Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Full Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological thrust or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is guided by an occult logic that is associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The possession of cars en masse also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new medical assistance techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had an important component of cultural determinism, drawn by such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography appeared that were better than laws imposed arbitrarily, since they were in harmony with the place and with society.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicentre of luxury began in about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as headquarters and spices that were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital departed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, and because of the slowness of the communication channels, the styles could reach the west with 25 to 30 years of delay.
towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time is that, as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to button clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is the one that is carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses native eco-conservations combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel abandoned by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Qualities that determine a subculture as different may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture are often distinguished from those of other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes modes, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to resort to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up, due to negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the rejection of the serious intellectual or physical deficiency of the child by the parents.
Wild children may have suffered child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others have supposedly been bred by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
The wild child, when raised only by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (always within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding theory is not a learning method, but an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing a new training experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real: in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the small Microsoft Office assistant clip.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software and are designed to question, show and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to go it alone.
Children are welcomed for different reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, through extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured, loved and educated, but there are those who do.
We believe that the family reception system is a form of security for these children.
Our reception system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
It is assumed that the host confers all the necessities that were not covered in the house from where they were originally taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the focus of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the public's reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it can be detected if a person lies by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, pointed out how people who are not able to understand speech because of brain damage but are still able to assess sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that these interpretive abilities of human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of patrimony of variation that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine the back and forth variation between the two genetic heritages in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as humans to meet their amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Failing to do so has serious consequences: decline in growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain would have been the proteins provided by the leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, these are difficult to digest by primates like us humans.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but provide a large amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised by the fact that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" as the savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of waking up during the normal period of sleep and falling asleep again after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This is easy to do using a low-noise alarm clock that makes you conscious but doesn’t wake you up completely.
If you are one of those who restarts the clock while you sleep, try to put it on the other end of the room, so that you have to take it to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, so one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is correlatively opposed to the amount of tension in body and spirit of oneself.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find peace and full satisfaction.
Everyone can get to enlightenment. The only thing that gets in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they spread along the path of love of the Mahayana and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, kundalini energy is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which facilitated collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes and cultures, and both countries were enmity.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next forty years and was fought in earnest, with delegated armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 the Polish defences had already been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete throughout the night, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered and created the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the International Non-Aggression Pact, or other Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy’s ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most relevant recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Contemporaneously, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany could have conquered Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountain range in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to easily dispose of milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were often kept in herds grazing on hills or other grazing areas, often guarded by shepherds who used to be children or teenagers. These grazing methods are still used today.
The wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they had wagons with horses to achieve higher speeds and greater loads in the more difficult parts.
The rails were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place. However, it was soon seen that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron cover over them.
This became common practice, but the iron more worn out the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning right-hand man).
His ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk straight as usual.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australpitec fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropists may have walked on 2 legs stretching all out 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more respectful way with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to partially reduce the suffering that could exist in the future.
This works only as a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and we should turn them off.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that problems have grown because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After its adoption by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft was sent, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson to John Dunlap's printing press located a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which today are known as "Dunlap's Flyers".
The first public reading of the document was carried out by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and that they are alive. We call them birds.
Many people don’t see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many features of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaur would.
Virtually every computer we use today relies on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, according to the computer slang.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting are fairly general, so an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic domestic chemicals.
Look for instructions on specific first aid for the specific poison on the label.
The term insect is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient kinship with bugs, which are insects highly adapted to human parasites.
Both redudids and bugs are nests, adapted to see in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, formed by the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has concluded that women are twice (2 times) more likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or the best interests of their child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents end their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greeks diminished, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small rural villages to go to their workplace and pass by others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic vehicle everyone, somehow, is connected with, and supports, a private car-based transportation system.
Science shows us today that this huge coal economy has disengaged one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of man over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries you will rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate these kinds of complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that are established between them.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because you can’t predict the driver’s behavior with 100% certainty.
Luckily, conductors tend to behave within a considerably constant range; therefore, the flow of traffic tends to have a considerable constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend their wings around their body.
This provides them with a wide variety of tiny places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the spied-on and the ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
There were people who thought what I said was true, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System was moving toward Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because we don’t have the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
20% of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people living in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since antiquity, as all of them can be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
It looked more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although in addition, according to his theory, they changed to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
One can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The whole universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of atoms would fit within the endpoint of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to lesser status and use.
Nowadays we write messages on computer screens, without ever needing a pointing machine.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new emerges.
The fission pump works on the principle that it takes energy to join a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart costs up. Separating the core again releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with a small or zero collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called crust.
The crust measures 70 km in thickness in the nearest part and 100 km in the farthest part.
It is thinner under lunar seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
There may be more lunar seas on the visible face because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to come out on the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people like or care about.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized so they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Human Needs and Hertzberg's Theory of Two Factors.
In general, two behaviors can appear so administrators begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to follow as "one more boy" (or girl).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary actions, carrying out evaluations, assigning responsibilities and making others responsible for their actions.
In the opposite case, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he has to change everything the team has been doing and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in strife between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with some minor differences.
Members of a virtual group usually function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that the local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administrative team to which each member is addressed. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, the joint work of an organization to overcome an adversity can lead to an innovative process to respond to the customer’s need.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. Therefore, it reduces the area of research and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that the different types of damage, trauma, injury and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate never-before-seen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that need intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to the client’s diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and face.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been built into various home computer applications and video games.
Thematic outings are an important part of any class. Very often, a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or contemplate the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online as a memoir.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the existence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogs "force students to be smarter with the world around them". The need to nurture audience interest inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students to be more analytical and critical; they can define their postures in the context of which they write others and also highlight their own perspectives on specific topics by actively responding to internet materials (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s enchanting bilingual capital and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
To the south are the Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoilt natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
It is all these elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out in the eyes of foreigners as a Canadian city par excellence.
The population of the large northern expanses is rather sparse, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To make a comparison of populations that is usually surprising: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by far, and a continent in itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts on the beach.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it undertook a great journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape of Europe Route in India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler say that she is married, regardless of the true marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (one that does not seem very expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can cause what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be persecuted, taken by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and don’t be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it’s not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazonian fishermen in the 10th century ANE, and Phoenicians, Romans and Benimerins used it as a strategic port, bearing the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of the White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name of Daru l-Badya, the name of Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina we can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, terrissa, leather objects, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it is all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, towards the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, mostly in the center.
While Goma is considerably safe, it would be advisable to investigate before making any visit outside this city to assess the state of the fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most economical mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use the wedding-wedding (moped taxis) to move around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" has ended up being used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special program "Wonders of the African World" for PBS.
The city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the country because it has a more Arab than African air.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each assisting diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entry fee must be paid.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a selection of South African parks, or to all of the National Parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong is named after the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
The set of buildings that make up the urban silhouette of Hong Kong has been related to a bright bar chart that is made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the other side of the Kowloon promenade.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on land gained at sea along the north coast.
This is the place the British colonizers occupied, so it’s a good place to start if you’re looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the interior of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps but include some of the last remaining stops in the mighty jungles that had once covered the gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/sweet areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers in the area and about 30,000 axes.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get around nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It extends along the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertically open space under the bridge is 15 meters. Although the construction ended in August 2011, it was not possible to transit there until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully functional by September 2017, when Brazil’s customs are expected to be filled.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, and lived as seminomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, who survived hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The most important annual tournament of this sport takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
Here you can also see tournaments and smaller matches at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), with an established value equivalent to that of a British Pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are also accepted.
In the outlying islands probably no credit cards will be accepted, although they can accept British and US currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which method of payment is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange currency from the Falklands outside the islands, so you have to do it to go away.
Since Montevideo is located in southern Ecuador, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures above 30 <0xC2><0xB0>C are common.
Winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely reach levels below zero, but wind and humidity combine to make the feeling cooler than what the thermometer signals.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is more or less invariable throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bones and wolves and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals!
As docile as they may look, bison, uapiti, ant, bone, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not having left a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that odors attract bones and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking odorous food and keep the camping site clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous insubordination in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to abandon it.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. In addition, almost 200 lives of Americans and Germans were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the death of supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are plentiful, as Auckland is on horseback from two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) overlook the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are at Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes full family beaches with a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The best known local beer is the "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be drunk, but New Zealand and Australian wines do not tolerate travel well.
It’s safe to drink water from the local tap, but if you’re scared, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of cutting is foreign. A short coffee is an express coffee, the cappuccino comes well loaded with cream (no foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The spoiled chocolate reaches the Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but the quality is excellent.
Throughout the year many trips are made to the reef and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
However, it follows the recommendations of the authorities, respects all signs and pays close attention to safety warnings.
Cubozous are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770. Occasionally they can also be found outside these months.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and get away from them.
Marine crocodiles do not make active life in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind to know that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camps, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even packages combined with flight and hotel.
They can also keep your booking if you need time to think about the offer or to present other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any request or suggestion should be sent first to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp there, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to get there early to get a place to camp near the music.
It should be remembered that even if the music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play well into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice generates a terrible noise in the most affected.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Passenger cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually strive to maximize the time and money that their visitors leave there. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special foods, drinks and entertainment offers to encourage guests and prevent them from leaving the establishment.
Some precincts offer alcoholic beverages inside the house. However, drunkenness alters the judgment, and all good "gamblers" know that it is important to stay sober.
Those who drive at high latitudes or between mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice or very low temperatures.
Friction is low on icy, snowy roads, and you can’t drive on them as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to catch you in a short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling snow or being displaced by wind, or by condensation or ice over vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the main tourist attraction in Africa and the most relevant for many tourists.
The term safari in popular usage refers to the journey over land to see the fantastic African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow good views.
Animals such as lions, cheetahs and leopards are shy from time to time, which is why you can see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "rural walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place in other places in Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March most coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were due to be held.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, with a typical entrance fee of <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry it. In many hotels you can ask for an iron and an ironing board, even if there is no one in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not like to bring ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the tissue to overheat (it could shrink or, in extreme cases, squeeze).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, the water is boiling for a minute; in others, it takes a few minutes.
Effectiveness changes from filter to filter, and in case of concerns you should consider buying water from a well-known brand in sealed bottles.
Travellers may encounter animal pests with which they are not familiar in their regions of origin.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of injuring or killing people by force, are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free purchases are an opportunity to buy duty-free goods in certain places.
Travelers bound to high-value countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo–Pittsburgh motorway, which frequently passes through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow sections and closed curves predominate.
The speed limits indicated are noticeably lower than those of other earlier and later sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict obedience to the limits is even more important than if it were otherwise.
Although it is curious, the mobile phone service is more powerful here than in many other segments of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastry is quite good and the Bavarian is very and very diverse, similar to that of Austria, its southern neighbors.

The struts are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They are more stable for the rider, but may present safety problems because the rider's feet could get trapped in them.
If a rider throws himself off the horse but has a foot stuck to the strut, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. In order to minimize this risk several safety precautions can be taken.
To begin with, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a single thin and strong thin.
In addition, some saddles, in particular the English ones, have safety bars that allow the leather of the tread to fall off the mount if a rider pulls it back when it falls.

Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down slopes covered in snow coast with skis or a surfboard tied to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bumps", planning the entire holiday around skiing to a particular place.
The concept of skiing is very ancient there are cave paintings symbolizing skiers before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, but it was in 1861 when Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Traveling with a backpack on skis: this activity is also called rural skiing, ski tourism or ski touring.
It is related, but generally does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being performed on face-to-face terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route as something similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you can travel a little longer distances than walking - although on rare occasions you will achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a rugged backpack on flattened slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling between several countries would involve having to make many visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without having to re-pass passport control.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa does not require to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen countries separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for manufactured articles that are considered antiques. Some tax agencies determine that goods over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit may be lower in places such as North America compared to Europe.
Artisan products can be catalogued as antiques, although they are more recent than other similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer breeding is an important means of subsistence among the Sami and the culture surrounding the marketing is also important for many with other trades.

Anyone intending to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should take a professional training course.
A search on the internet for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely offer the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the problems that have been dealt with here in better detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will typically last 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, many first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that talk about survival in nature are frequent, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.

Preoperative transsexuals should not be expected to go through scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Catch currents are the stream that comes back after the waves hit the beach, often to a reef or the like.
Due to the topology of the water, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper seasons, and a strong current can form into deep waters.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue in attempting to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, swimming backwards is no more difficult than usual.
Try to go somewhere where you are not captured again or, depending on your abilities or if you have been informed, you may want to wait for a ransom.
The return shock comes before the cultural shock (with a minor honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture often find it particularly difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of native culture.
When you went abroad, at first probably people were patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Sometimes one does not foresee that patience and understanding are also needed when travelers return home.

The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are disputed among many nations and have most bases, with sixteen active by 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are the islands of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano confers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge and form a plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, part of the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a maximum of 4,892 m of Mount Vinson.
In remote locations and without phone coverage, satellite telephony may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of visibility to make a phone call.
The service is usually used on boats, including recreational craft, as well as on expeditions that require remote data and voices.
Your local telephony service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.

There will typically be tuition fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an important sailing destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You do not need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although any yacht can pass through the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sports sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
This is equated with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is also quite special (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises make an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic center of the city using a couple of whole days returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only disembark with excursions on board, you do not need an independent visa (dated 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not for anything near the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and all backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or have suffered a traumatic experience.

For some, having notions about how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Courier companies charge well to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandising or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent things by plane, there are routes where unloading and passing through customs can take days.
The only way to send it faster, was to do it as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger who carries it, and this is where you enter.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to pay a lot of money for this privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of the economy rate for the business class, and up to eleven times in the first class!
In general, it makes no sense to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay more for the privilege of arriving at a place quickly and comfortably, and paying accordingly.

However, people who can speak a little Spanish can precipitously conclude that Portuguese resembles it so much that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today, and remain as museums, or places of education.
Since light pollution at the time is not a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those currently built.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, an action known as hanami, is part of Japanese culture from the 8th century onwards.
The concept comes from China, where the cherry blossom was the most appreciated.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossoms were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.

All the animals that originally arrived on the island did so by swimming, flying or floating.
The great distance from the mainland prevented the mammals from traveling there and this caused the giant tortoise to become the first grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs have been introduced.
If you visit the areas of the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will live the polar night, in which the sun does not come up on the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will remain dark virtually all day.
