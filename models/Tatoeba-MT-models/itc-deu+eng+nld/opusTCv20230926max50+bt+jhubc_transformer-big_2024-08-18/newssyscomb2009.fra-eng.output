Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of the current president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remain, with 29.8 percent of the vote, the country's leading political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the vote, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Still in early July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
Now, voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations were made about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday, at the party’s extraordinary leadership council.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election result which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the grand coalition SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FP<0xC3><0x96>) would have obtained 18 percent and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the vote - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZ<0xC3><0x96> split from the common government).
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently bets on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they slightly lost and fell, among Austrian political parties, from third to fifth.
Clearly, no other party crossed the four-percent limit and entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India at risk of cooling
If the problem with Czech researchers accused in India of illegally picking cockroaches could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, a cooling of Czech-Indian relations would ensue.
The minister said this today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem were not resolved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, which was held following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, on exiting the talks, that the executive branch could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was discharged from the prosecution and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
From then on, he could ask for bail and wait for the trial in freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises appealing to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance was already being provided to them by India as well.
“We want above all to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition that goes on for many years.
The Indians also recognize this,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We view the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers as a great contempt," he said.
The minister evaded the question of whether he had obtained from India a promise to deal with the case.
“I’ve already received quite a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech arbitrates the fight for the seabed
It approaches a walled electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are depicted.
But he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area is however as large as the continent itself," says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of 30 members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech jurist V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The ardor at work and the enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known so far, rich in natural resources.
There are oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms that are currently unknown, which may hold the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A bottom wider than the land
The coastal states have now begun to aspire vehemently to the new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they use their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is known as the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, exclusively claim all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic zone,” Mikulka said.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf, must be supported by a broad scientific and technical documentation, based on many expensive surveys and metrical data.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the committee has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which is the first to significantly expand its underwater possessions, has recently had a global impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission assigned to it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their request.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no state has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"However, let's not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," director Mikulka said, exaggerating, noting that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime is anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc countries within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, the Commission, as well as investors from a few other States, obtained the status of the so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the Clarion Clipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is enlivened, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, brings an example of such a realization.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoe, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the scene for the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had sought help from Germany for resolving the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are being revealed.
According to the indications of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists from the Federal Army and officials from GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk were at the place of release.
As the spokeswoman for the Ministries communicated on Monday evening, German forces were ultimately not required, as hostage-takers released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of a forcible release.
The Egyptian government allegedly accepted the assistance offered by Germany to integrate it on the spot as a support force.
"Happily, this has not happened so far," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers had kidnapped in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has so far remained vague, as have the details of release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have meanwhile arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to "Bild" magazine, the five vacationers and special forces are expected to take off aboard an Airbus from the air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress narrowly failed the $700 billion bailout of the financial markets.
The Dow Jones was sinking into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout in favor of financial markets.
Despite all the calls from US President George W. Bush and the politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to thwart the chaos of the financial markets did not win a majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the partisans had desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-foundedness of this heavy $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on MPs to vote in favor although the plan is unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investors’ concern that the state bailout might overturn.
It came up shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate is required.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans’ thirst for travel remains insatiable, according to this study.
In terms of bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded revenues of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) told Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, growing booking numbers are already dominating the autumn months.
Thus the sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent more compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyses monthly booking data from 1,200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the USA would be particularly in demand, said DRV.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
Besides that, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be destinations particularly sought after by the Germans.
Organized trips in particular are in high demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be "more easily calculable for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money among other things with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very tight, so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who have undertaken a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apr<0xC3><0xA8>s-Ski continuously, beer in litre pitchers and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television host and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean suit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer festival, and already the photographers throw themselves at us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and that on my first visit to the beer festival.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the equator of the Weißwurst, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in the square Therese, everything is half less worse.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks blasé or embarrassed - this is completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean suit collects a few bizarre eyelashes at the banana-choc<0xC3><0xB3> stand.
A Bavarian woman remarked to me that I had wrongly tied my apron: "to the left means free, to the middle virgin, to the right married, to the back widow."
Discreetly, I triplicate my buckle from the back to the left.
“It’s better,” she said and laughed.
Others don't give themselves so much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drink to get dressed!" and exposes their naked buttocks without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer festival.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an "oooo" lying down.
He tells me all this after he was relieved of the cup he had drunk before.
Right next to this fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild pissers."
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, swarms of rescuers run to the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses rather intervene in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer festival: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who lie in the coffin of the stuffed under the tarpaulin are not visible.
“They are the ones who can no longer swallow anything,” one of the rescuers shouts in response to my question and then disappears into the fray.
Victim of accident identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident in town on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He's been released since, on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps away from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its angles, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we no longer have any doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, retarded to the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and Empire forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the meanderings of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to underline the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new policy of commitments.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeping car in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP AKP Turkish Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 and a half hours, shaken on noisy tracks whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital – presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of a shift in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and Washington in particular.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built in stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and numerous bakeries in which middle managers in suits-tie-men and women-meeting for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
“The purpose of this foreign policy is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for both.
She had to do both.
"But, at one point, I asked if Turkey shouldn't choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "does not want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone I spoke with recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe metaphorically traveling on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least, there is no longer any doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music Director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was to include those under 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 refused to leave the choir.
The denomination "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and this thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there, in the music.
“Sing!”
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was leading the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me—and, sometimes, they've even inspired me.
Tod Handley held so rare this combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, “focused only on certain people.”
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
William Woodruff's obituary (died 25 September) states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history, at Oxford, and became a member of hops-Norma research in 1950, while doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
That’s what Woodruff’s author wrote in Beyond Nab End, but that’s not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Hops, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition 'Flamenco and Life' because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second assault on Honda’s super sales
In November Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new minivan has an even wider interior space.
Added to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among them are an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation was launched on the market.
First of all, we note that Honda has upgraded this model in a shorter period of time than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years stands in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it expects to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% sales growth in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
Heads of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand managers hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease in sales of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also expects to gain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size - 4.37 meters in length - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight sales will be in the United States, while the other half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned for the first three months of next year, after its public presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change, i.e. 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and so is the interior space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the trunk capacity – which has a double bottom system – can hold up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity than the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation – in addition to exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof – is the improved access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, relative to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two petrol thrusters of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-liter engine produces 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous powerplant, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The ‘bee car’ that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has taken inspiration, this time, from nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have designed the small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Chief Public Relations Officer for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan Safety Shield.
This robot will allow the brand’s vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important is the eyes composed of the bee, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows him to fly without interruption inside his own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed a so-called laser range finder.
It detects obstacles over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurcating its wheels by 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Displacement Laboratory and principal engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
“Every second this device only has to process information and act on that data.
It does not need to keep the information or the intuitive logic of previous manoeuvres, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first car to develop new technologies for instantaneous collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced in production cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot runs on lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, apart from having a lot of liquidity to make plans, is not devoid of geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: ‘Bad Credit Hotel’.
That is to say 'the Hotel of bad credits'... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially the Master of Hotel leads us to think repeatedly if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
Surely this game gives useful information but little detail.
It’s more of a game for teenagers.
What happens if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It is better than nothing, since it is unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, which will pay $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a new welcome by a sharp fall in its stock price.
A week after unveiling an interim deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a unit price of $25.25, or a total amount of $3 billion.
The price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall deal would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28 percent above its current price.
Morgan Stanley was down 6.79% at $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a banking holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but puts it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a far more cautious stance than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained to Tokyo, “we thought that the participation would be entirely composed of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley shares 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into common shares in a year if they trade more than 50% above the conversion price, or at about $47, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley says MUFG’s capital will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" eased its balance sheet since late August.
The past few weeks have been trying for the group, which has seen its stock price melt in half as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt soared.
The cost fell back on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the buyout of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refounding the Republic around 21st Century Socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, was the third to put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" received 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a wide victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed in an overwhelming way," he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place quietly according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observer mission, was about a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country living essentially from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currencies sent by its emigrants.
Carried by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the head of state, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
All 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
The apparently fit hostages arrived at around 3.30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, unable to speak to the press, in helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health," and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, carrying two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing," the official, who requested anonymity, said.
He said a total of 150 Egyptian special forces members of the "lightning" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our secret service men, special forces," he said, without further detail.
He also denied the payment of ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle in which the kidnappers were, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and occupies this election campaign.
Good for you.
But one part of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the sums of misery that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that he neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and this in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 history, heritage, archival and genealogical societies are concerned with digging through history, preserving private archives with three subsets, and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European bank in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, up to a sum of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also having interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Competition Officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the amplifying international financial crisis in more than a year is for Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy almost half (up to 49%) of the capital of the bank located in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its holdings, including, in the first place, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a dizzying fall, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
On Friday, the company’s shares fell 12 percent to their lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company’s executives, is not realistic.
The company's management accuses the overseas uncertainty, related to the adoption of the US $700 billion bailout, of being the cause of the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank’s customer circle and no agency was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also bought out leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become out of control.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information about the prescription of medicines, in any case, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it amounts to entrusting your chicken coop to a fox," Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told The Washington Post.
The insurance companies make the insurance premium and the insured capital in case of damage dependent on the health status of the client who presents himself, and if they feel that the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they would send candidates for a medical examination, and they would not sign an insurance contract with them until they had heard of the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he can easily obtain from pharmacies data on the person's drug purchases in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, which disease the person suffers from and what his state of health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol lowering, it refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is not much left to do to the insurer other than paperwork. However, tiny problems may still appear.
Disadvantages of this program include the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while others do not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data. They must seek the patient's permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are compelled to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctioned for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory analyses, and linking them with data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time usage control is becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill to broaden the circle of control of the authorities over companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not sufficient and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him.
So, in the end, the hens depend on the fox's kindness.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India double their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other, largely global, problems.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit where cooperation in the field of atomic energy will be the main issue.
The European Union recognizes that India is an emerging major democratic power that should be given wider voice in international affairs, but member countries have yet to agree on their support in New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this issue, yesterday, at the 9th summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would double trade, which means an increase of a good hundred euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from $25 billion to $55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious goal.
In this sense, they have harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights from a legal point of view, so that air trade can also take off in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, the EU's main trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as were all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on the subject was raised.
Completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, including that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 per cent until 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the fact that a global market should be passed at next year’s climate conference, and greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by fifty percent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported convening an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state travels today to the French capital, where during a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the news agency, the deal would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
A strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, during the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: in fact, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a press meeting in the Room Struktur, at the Buchmesse butterfly 5.0: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books gradually decreases in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular, in relation to that for adults and children.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: “The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it was the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared.”
The sheriff said no human remains were found on or around the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that a few hours after the wreck was spotted, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft as the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, again in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset’s personal belongings were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history through a long series of records.
On the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had traveled the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among all these records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters in height, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
An unusual 4x4 with an original and well-defined design, marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
Here, in summary, Glk, the latest off-road "compact" of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
The unexpected and unconventional content will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17th.
Thus the hype that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, it will appear that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimin8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future acquirers? We will see.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created major problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with the opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (little in reality) from Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricoloured flags on which their hometown appeared: Saturday night, they were all abducted so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English typhoon.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhoon of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in course, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal waits to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it could be that the fans arrested or identified in disorder purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids to attend Italian stadiums, but also European.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Thankfully.
But now is the time for fear-emulation: that is to say, others risk being added to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," says the Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes wide open especially in view of Wednesday's national team game in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say the secret services, which deal precisely with the problems of stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm extended during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really not pleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste, where a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the number 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to Mameli's anthem: those too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not polite..."
