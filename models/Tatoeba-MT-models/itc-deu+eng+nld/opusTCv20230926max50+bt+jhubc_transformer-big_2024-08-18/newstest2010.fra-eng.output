Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth US president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will be awarded to him, among others, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's schedule then includes an interview with Norway's King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will peak in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third to receive the award in the Committee’s own premises.
The White House has informed in advance that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he is receiving this award by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million euros).
He intends to donate it to charities, but he has not yet decided concretely which ones.
His busy schedule then took him and his wife to a banquet that included, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at first.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said it would be an “invitation to action.”
A Nature Advocate Accused of Blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police have charged the president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Protectors with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police.
The president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Protectors is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not fragrant in Brno
In Prague, everyone can sort their beverage packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you come across sorting bins on every corner.
What about Brno?
There, you would need to take several minutes before finding the right dumpsters.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the garbage in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that the city councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of waste sorting not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of bins dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires above all time and nerves of steel.
The only place I found at the moment is Moravian Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues do not like me, but it seems to me damn little.
Not to mention the fact that in other areas of the city it is not a sinecure either.
So, in the end, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
By laziness.
It makes them go a long way to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colored buckets on Kounicova Street.
Luckily I found the right place by taking the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It is after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is probably that ecology and a so-called aestheticism do not interest too much the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a first league hockey spot that shames the city across the country, instead of buying a few extra buckets and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after spending a while on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget removed silvery pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the advice of the government, farmers or even civil servants it may be that there is lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interests in state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they relied on the fact that the government would borrow for sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems off, undermining the ground," Janota said.
It must be known that on the money borrowed the interest payable is increasingly higher and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state doesn’t really have a choice as to where to draw money.
If he doesn't cut welfare or his spending, he'll have to raise taxes.
To all those whom the left has now increased: the firefighters, the teachers, the farmers.
And then their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater state indebtedness - next year it will not miss 163 billion in the caisses, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it, interest-related expenses.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to raise VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also miss $5 billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and started and where it is not possible to modify the projects to eventually reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major construction sites, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very skillfully - it will draw on the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ (electricity supplier and distributor), which the state owns for the most part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is by no means a bottomless pit.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Each year, the dividends are used to pay for the removal of environmental damage, to supplement pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 per cent of GNP under EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, and even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international proceeding, we will have to pay for it anyway, notes Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department’s side or, in the worst case, touch the government’s budget reserve.
There is also a lack of $100 million in the two-billion-dollar state-cash project, which is designed to keep track of each administration's spending online.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warns.
Your Next Smartphone Will Master Two Operating Systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed look promising.
Just a button and you can switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which deals mainly with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
The two will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, which was running the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems simultaneously.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to the devices in 2012.
Snow scarcity in the mountains is troubling hoteliers
The deserted slopes are not a problem only for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year’s.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking at the moment.
And if they call us, they ask right away if there will be snow or mud at Christmas,” said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n, it is better not to hesitate too much to book.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation only comes later, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler currently only offer one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they will try for a while to place them, but they will also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week we are most interested in at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There are still, say, half the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> tourist agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays sell on average.
This year, interest in winter holidays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be complete,” says Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few places left for the New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the January holidays of the Poles and February sells well too," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central car park of J<0xC3><0xA1>nské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> is also 80 percent complete during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in J<0xC3><0xA1>nské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at the moment.
February is a little weaker for now but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will certainly grow again said the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
Hoteliers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, however, should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rain, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But afterwards, the weather is expected to warm, reports Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is a Mother of Wisdom
It even becomes comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president with the reputation of wise, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, which he considered himself to be very simple.
When he finally let his long-awaited doctrine sweat, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not content with using in the text even the phrase "as in Iraq" several times, he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into a civil war-consumed Iraq as “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its aftermath.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to be so successful that the newspapers at present do not speak at all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that being said, objectively speaking, he left his successor in a much more favorable final situation than one could hope for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who called for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the White House's reluctance despite subordination habits.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he swindled at least the 10,000-strong general.
It succeeded in removing the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it originally counted on 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to finish this whole process within three years, and Obama's whole doctrine brings more questions than answers.
Many doubt that a half increase will bear the same fruit as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out in the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to day-to-day leadership changes according to what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain nothing but powder for the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is uniquely complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity in relations, which are further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a “prompt state to act,” which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is perplexing because of his voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out-of-reality heart can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent into the turmoil of war for their "prompt return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is negative.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the enhanced sanctions do not have an effect on the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult question of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only nuisance for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to plan a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs CEOs will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executive employees at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company has announced it to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
Shares can be withdrawn from leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link remuneration with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the global sense to take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs Bank has become the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will likely exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the advent of the financial crisis, high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it plans to allocate bonuses for bankers in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 from a single 50 percent tax.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
Five women, a record number, received today in Stockholm from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustave of Sweden the Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine with their compatriot Jack Szostak for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The latest recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Elinor Ostrom of the United States, along with fellow countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the pecuniary reward.
This reaches ten million Swedish kronor in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward among themselves.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize winner has already been handed over this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
The latter, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his award since it is only the beginning of his journey and that he is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
To the disclaimer of his policy, he added that in some situations war is indispensable for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will receive on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the crisis in public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed of the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss her position Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus for signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion kroner that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday validated the proposals of the left on money transfers and increased the remuneration of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a disagreement that calls into question the future of Fischer's cabinet that had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as voted by MPs, removes the savings package passed by Fischer's government, which he says must stem the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but is not obligated to do so, said today at a breakfast of talks with entrepreneurs, that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrepressible deficiency" of public finances.
In his view, there is currently no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
SDG President Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said the budget is frightening and the government should question its future existence.
SDG Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the SDGs and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek is frightening and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD called the ratification of the state budget for next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in new Clint Eastwood film
Despite criticism that the lead roles are played by American actors, South Africans say the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invincu will expose the world to much about the country, its struggles and victories.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman portrays the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that it was a ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The 72-year-old actor who was awarded an important award for his role in Clint Eastwood’s drama Million Dollar Baby set in the middle of boxing has, for example, played the leader of an anti-slavery movement who became a slave himself, a fictional president of the United States, or even God in the film Evan All-Powerful but never a living man.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his hard work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and captain of the South African rugby team Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois to unify the country.The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders at the world level.
The South African team will eventually progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
I had no other goal but to play this role in such a way as to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I recover your energy, it transmits and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in rugby hardcore.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, he opened me up and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, ‘I look a lot bigger in the movie.’
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the direction of director Eastwood has received positive reviews and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on Rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday to having tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch was still a failure, however, and the Bulava-type missile that was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian military gradually becomes the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got damaged in mid-flight.
Russian newspapers refer to "Bulava" as "missile that does not fly"
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th trial was normally conducted at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the aircraft again.
It was clearly the rocket's third-stage engine that exploded.
This time, Bulava flew off the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be justly fired from a moving vessel and submerged
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was most likely caused by a defective Bulava.
After all, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk about failure at all.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the damage hit only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the Department of Defense management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetissov will again appear in a professional match at age 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend a helping hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entry already during Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, said club coach Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the AP news agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will involve only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, said Nyemchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won twice the gold at the Olympic Games, seven world champion titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as at the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai listens to unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared an emergency strike on Monday.
Hyundai factory spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k confirmed this.
The management, however, still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
The Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz website said the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of Saturday's team.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for extra hours, or they can take a replacement leave on December 28th and thus extend their Van<0xC4><0x9B>k-indicated end-of-year parties.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of unions as workers who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, employees at the auto plant were forced to work almost two extra hours per day in addition to their eight hours.
The unions plan to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday they were ready to end the strike state if they agreed on their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation at the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees went on strike spontaneously because of incessant overtime.
They were also protesting against poor wage conditions and alleged abuses.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in surcharges to meet the requirements for the production of automobiles.
In announcing the strike on Monday, the unions also demanded that workers who had stopped production should not be subject to any sanctions.
The unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (approximately €209) for these.
The Hyundai car plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It began serial production last year in November.
It produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: A Substance That Works on "Endurant" HIV Viruses Too
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new combinations that can slow the proliferation of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes precedence, in some cases, over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on common variants of the virus as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, it is possible to radically prolong the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a series of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg, paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are an assemblage of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "enhanced" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings on virus proteins.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease, there would be no emergence of mature infectious particles of the virus.
Stopping the protease of HIV will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test tubes as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, are therefore interesting combinations to examine further in order to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the laboratory of structural biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry.
Dispute over the budget. The SDG takes on Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the SDG (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek, called the ratified budget for the following year "frightening" and he said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the SDG’s remarks a drastic verdict.
He said to take time to analyze.
SDG spokesman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the idea of an administrative cabinet backed by <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, SDG and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the head of government should decide whether he takes in the Chamber of Deputies support for the minority that is concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about staying in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned that the positions of the SDGs and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday ratified the budget for 2010, with proposals for amendments amounting to 12 billion kroner included by the left.
The House increased the amount of money earmarked for civil servants' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance over the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The SDG left the room before the vote, obeying the government's wish that an amended budget was a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still be reflecting on the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota threatens to leave office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment on Monday with the prime minister after his transition to government:
At the same time, he said he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that the representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers appointed by the SDGs are not involved.
This is the business of the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the SDGs have done nothing detrimental, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries claim TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and once it's on the agenda, I'll focus on it," Defence Minister Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k, who was elected to the government by the Democrats, told reporters in the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew off in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDG backed down at the Prime Minister's request.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed at the same time that the SDG would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked Democratic MPs to allow the budget to be voted on.
We don't feel like we're orphans, we're not little children, he reacted to the question of whether the SDGs had not suffered reproaches from the party president in the House or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I did not notice that my vote was missing.
I already knew by the time I resigned my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a Bolshevisation of the House and a destruction of all that was positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek personally reacted.
According to the new schedules of the <0xC4><0x8C>D there will be fewer trains for the same rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit some less loaded express or regional trains from December 13 and instead strengthen some others.
Total transportation coverage will decrease by the day the new schedules come into effect by two percent compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including base rates and the reduced rate.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport is in the Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové region of eight per cent in total, but Prague and its environs can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of a few express trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague's main train station (Praha Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>).
The <0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The invoice this year for regional railways: an additional 200 million crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in a total of four billion crowns to settle visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for their total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate in the amount of almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they have not resorted to price increases for the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will only affect <0xC4><0x8C>D Net day tickets and eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka discounted internet tickets.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again depend on the route traveled, whereas until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroner.
Philippine rebels continue to detain more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels today kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP news agency that reported it, but that originally spoke of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 rebels reportedly used the hostages as human shields during a police escape.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of the southern Philippines province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood movie hits theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), and chronicles part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback of critics and audiences is heard.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of thought, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film has high hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the World Cup, and on the other hand because the media is agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations expressed towards the main roles where Hollywood stars "stagger".
Morgan Freeman, in his own words, is proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have prepared myself well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to be able – as they say – to recover from his energy, he said at the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember Mandela’s personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual, he added.
Wearing the national rugby team jersey
In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his tenure as president.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to reunite two racial groups from a long-divided population and like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had then won.
For showing up on the jersey lawn, which is regarded in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had long been ovated fourteen years ago mostly by the white public and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people back into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
South African whites are skeptical, however, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain, recently said in an interview.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire in the morning engulfed a transformer of the <0xC4><0x8C>eps company of the distribution center near the municipality of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov na Lounsku.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, spokesman for the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn, but they reviewed their opinion and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokesperson of the company Pavla Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission assembly.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure will be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in the ten years of activity, the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps has not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electricity supplies were not interrupted, says <0xC4><0x8C>EZ spokeswoman for North Bohemia So<0xC5><0x88>a Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries was not influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps is the exclusive operator in the Czech Republic of transmission assemblies and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transport assemblies to the distribution assemblies and lines with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to file defamation suit against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD prefects
Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, owner of Student Agency, will file a defamation complaint against three Democratic social prefects.
And specifically against Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the South Moravian region, against Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura reported it in Dvacet minut de Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three have attacked us and say that we make fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways which were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on the Student Agency company, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
Similarly, he said he has evidence that no region has proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers that Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s complaint represents the continuation of his media spectacle, which serves as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who is manipulating public opinion and resorting to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavorable approaches of the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l that he will stop the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the rail links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura threats from a <0xC4><0x8C>SSD MP.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I do not know who he is but I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococci.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 crowns on vaccine doses.
They do, however, save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
So far the state has spent about 500,000 crowns a year on all the vaccination of children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions regarding a possible obligation to vaccinate in the future.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, president of the association, said that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococci.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that we must now follow, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococci.
We are not considering it at all at the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccination based on volunteering is its flaws.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> says however.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococci also marks a break in the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves.
However, this is related to the concerns of paediatric practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some MEPs, however, feared that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct amounts from health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to individually invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Theft"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
She said Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the museum into the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Frazetta Senior denies giving such authorization, the agency said.
Labour is advocating an increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also drew lightning strikes by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5% in Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public salaries from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are being penalized by a recession they are not responsible for and warned that "problems" were being announced.
The reduction in Social Insurance – which will bring in about GBP 3 billion a year – has angered the business world, because he said it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small companies has been abandoned
Discounts on taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
2.5% increase in pensions
According to Treasury estimates, a person who wins <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and a person who wins <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who wins <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 per year will gain <0xC2><0xA3>110 more.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 led to "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would weigh on the top 5% of employees.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms refuted a tax increase and stressed that a decrease in spending was a “drop in the ocean” compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would restart at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will influence how much it will borrow and how quickly the deficit will be filled - were called into question after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely decline by 4.75% this year — far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April — while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than previously estimated.
"Opportunity Missed"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign warning against the Labour “debt crisis,” said the plan to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers have failed to come up with a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" evading difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything meaningful about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, chief Treasury secretary of the Phantom Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
"The important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from further cuts, contrary to the Tory proposals that would lead to a faster and greater reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems said the money raised through higher taxes and lower spending would be used to support next year’s spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were “built on wind.”
Nick Robinson, the BBC’s political editor, said the timing of the announcements — such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits in April, mentioned above — would leave the Chancellor facing accusations of propaganda, with the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False Budget"
Although ministers did not release details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that government spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor’s figures imply, in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transportation, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only postponed," said its Director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of who wins,” added Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s Economic Advisor to Accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report. Markets are well aware of it."
FBI Investigates 'Arrests of Americans in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing from their home in Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani ancestry, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are being held,” spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing,” she said.
Pakistan's embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said the house was already under surveillance by local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the United States needed to "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were taken missing from their homes by their families in northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian “abuse”
Over the past 20 years, human rights have been as poorly respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
The report presents “repeated violations” by the regime before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man cited in the report claimed he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its non-compliance with human rights.
Authorities have said such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now London, says that at the beginning of the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some of the abuse allegations, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent says.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the neck, on the head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate in the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 others, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary would set up a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of those bodies were unclear and the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in order to prevent further protests.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last book of the author, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He has spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows how to listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim Woman Marry a Non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that worry the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not pushing the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their fellow advocates of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who today make up a small part of Europe’s Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the virulent guardian intellectual elite of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of key values".
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In On a Thin Layer of Ice, Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the Great North symbol, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were proving their worth by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave 14-year-old aspirant who had to fight only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young teddy bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous spectacle gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually still one millionth of the area needed by an adult in the wild. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has turned green due to algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often recounts the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motorcycle Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse into what the future might look like there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's not like you're trying.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering voyages gave the first information about the melting of the ice sheet.
Cold War submarines then mapped the changes in relief beneath it.
Satellite surveillance and iceberg probes are a great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice tributary system, formed by the squeezed brackish water nets as it freezes.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, expected between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it may be our turn.”
Marines among 6,000 people who laid crowns on graves in Arlington
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus ride to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to saluting the men and women who were once in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would want someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on veterans’ graves, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey each year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embedded in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient tombs dating from World War I and World War II, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not as often visited as the new tombs, organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples held hands, carrying the fresh pine wreaths on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red bow tie at the top.
Close by, was the silence on Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals wept without hiding, others prayed and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned over to see the small black and white information cards, thrust into the damp earth for those whose grave had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears, on her son's grave.
She departed Zanesfield, Ohio and had driven eight hours to the grave of Marine Sergeant Gunnery David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget how free we are... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. Citizen Arrested by Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, the U.S. Foreign Ministry said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husbands and they are followed and harassed by government agents.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards but the authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the Communist Brotherhood government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which pursues a “soft” approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although this is new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day’s pay.
On the island, internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press secretary with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program at Human Rights Watch, which recently released a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to Raul Castro's installation as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his ill older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, put on trial and imprisoned on the same day.
He said any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, as the two countries begin to engage in better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization alleged to be plotting to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving of the terrorist waves on the internet video site YouTube.
Arriving in Pakistan, the men were led by Saifullah, who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north became a haven of terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The official said the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to gain entry into al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasize the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. Secret Service has made it a priority to infiltrate men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, denying entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert with the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also be more careful in recent years in choosing the people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment pattern than so many other people have already followed?
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for ‘climate action’
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, calling for more climate action from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists ignited some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched around the city, displaying signs in English saying 'There is no Planet B' and one in Spanish, declaring 'The Earth says it has had enough'.
Several celebrities joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s home country of Peru opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change already occurring.
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to get the word out and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella center and said she had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella center and said she had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or in possession of pocket knives.
According to a bystander who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in the climate talks, activists wearing masks and black clothing lit several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were throwing them near buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congr<0xC3><0xA8>s, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “Actually, it’s something I wasn’t aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking may seem harmful or useful depending on the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
Test results reveal tenacious differences between races
Last week’s federal report on math scores brought good news for Washington D.C.’s public schools.
Although the District still lags far behind the leading settlements, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in much greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between African-American and white outcomes, both locally and nationally.
The average results of white Grade 4 (cm1) children in Washington D.C. have increased, over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean blank result was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently large.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by Head of Education Group Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were being propelled by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and annoying, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in District education.
I’m not jumping joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame R. Brown (a Democratic kinsman), a D.C. Council Member whose daughter is Grade 4 at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said the message from the test results is that the city’s middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what’s scary is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of struggling students.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at schoolchildren in the elementary and early grades who did not incorporate the basics of reading earlier in their school careers and who are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the mathematics program, for grade 6 kindergarten classes, focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to provide better interventions to these lower-level students than the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to elevate the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for less successful schools to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in Washington’s poorest neighborhoods.
This targeting can also have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other school superintendents, she is trying to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, are assured that their children will be able to obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to narrowing the achievement gap was the duration of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to be competing with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with her teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" to get another raise in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and blinks for a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
"That's where I'm going to study!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, as the guide led them to the entrance of the science building.
"Youpi, really?" she said, thinking, when she was told of the low ratio of law professor to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still arises largely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in their teens, they are also hundreds of thousands benefiting from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five second-generation Hispanics pursue high school -- a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, paving the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study swingers say they have a natural affinity for school and an innate need for success.
Many parents also set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (Prepare Yourself), it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize college preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been attended by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's oil ministry gets deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in rehabilitating Iraq’s oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
The U.S. companies went out with a stake in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only person who put up an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies were awarded contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The weak representation of US oil giants in the opening up of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday and political instability as U.S. military troops retreated, have held back U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering more forcefully into Iraq which has the world’s third-largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, at a disadvantage because of their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
Major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have had strong ties to and technical advice from the Iraqi Oil Ministry, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. bid more on contracts than other companies and left with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to bid made bids that were then compared to the per-barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of al-Qaida's main organizers was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, U.S. counterintelligence officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unmanned plane of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan’s anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistan's civilian secret service, speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
Officials said suspected local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of "totally shredded bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two US anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaida's military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somali had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general American public, but that does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major al-Qaida figure or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations a month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a nonprofit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to lessen their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday he would resign in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate plagued by allegations of widespread corruption during the U.N.-backed presidential elections.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the U.S. timetable for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign but would simply honor his March pledge to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura was cited; it is an Italo-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations but said Galbraith's accusations -- which he was thankful for -- "have prejudiced the mission because there was already a fair amount of skepticism about international election observation."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate U.S. forces' relief efforts in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying it would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, saying the UN's heavy hiring regulations hampered his opportunities to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's major powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a ground floor of 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, de-dramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs on me the most is that if I've learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it's the unpredictable side of war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of those sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said a “set of motivations and punishments” might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons” because “its people would suffer enormously” from these sanctions.
In a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Friday, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face “probable” consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment solely for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he said he would resume dialogue on reducing his nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant portion of his enriched uranium storage in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a means of building confidence on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts at agreement – in part, experts say, because Iran’s leadership is divided over whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran’s stiffening up against some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually agreed in early October, has pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to come together on what they had not envisaged, in terms of additional significant sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before he turns to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to get a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to the wealthy Kurdish oil region to meet Troop Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters admonishing them, “Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children” and “One more baby is an extra grave.”
They learned the lesson so well that Shanghai Government authorities, alarmed by their city’s insufficient birth rate and aging population, radically changed direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don’t have a second left, said Wang, a 31-year-old human resources director with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of labour in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become “as old – but not as rich, though – as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden,” she said.
Progressive Mitigation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is to date, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who break this policy risk colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese authorities have assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boys-to-girls ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced with copies of regulations detailing who is entitled to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slip flyers under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those wishing to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural suburban city of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records from couples wishing for a second child after the campaign’s launch, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she only wanted one child because she was one of them herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us."
We’re not used to taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old owner of a translation company, puts it more bluntly.
For middle-class couples working in pairs, who are lowering the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish if you want to succeed.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child demands a lot of time from their parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there's the space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for emission reductions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- returned to the limelight on Friday, due to the release of a paper highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations reinforcing most of the burden.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, underlined the remaining obstacles, as well as shed light on the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in the time-deprived negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a special UN working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, in the long run and in the long run.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging economies could decrease their carbon production and what the upper limit of global temperature rise would be that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative at the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN Executive Secretary-General on Climate Change Yvo de Boer described as “the complete picture.”
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday by promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the U.S. Representative to the Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion requiring greenhouse gas reductions by industrialized countries, in comparison to the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if these were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is getting tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from major developing countries, Stern said, also regretting that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the US chief negotiator either lacked “common sense” or was “extremely irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the US would not help China financially to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States quarreling over their respective obligations as poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it was not surprising that major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even if vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold major emitters accountable for their actions.
This is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say negotiations will lead to a political agreement at a minimum.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission’s climate unit, said the action of small island states has “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part by what they are now unified and calling on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they needed to resolve most of the pending issues before the heads of government could reach an agreement.
High-level officials such as India's Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China's Deputy Minister got off their plane and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and briefings so they could make claims that would be considered over the next week.
The real picture of the rally -- in which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des Congr<0xC3><0xA8>s every day -- guitar-playing activists present nightly shows mocking countries that they say are betraying themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of greats, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavy trucks are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday’s syndrome
At 5:13 a.m., Monday morning, a whistle will pierce through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The small holes lost will become thriving suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter and the passage of the plane and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the <0xC2><0xA3>10bn needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable battle of planning, and fears of environmental hazards are poised to slow Britain’s high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a larger, northbound high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go all the way to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with one branch going west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
“It looks like this will be the best performance option,” said one rail professional.
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour-long trip currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal capable of accommodating 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to ride off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland in excess of three hours.
This seems to be the best solution to ensure a transition from airplanes to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers reimburse <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, a senior member of Tory's parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orangery he built in his constituency home.
The party leader, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were “entertained,” increased his loan by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been allowed to charge the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a check on members' expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan said that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his riding of Rutland-Melton.
The neighboring houses were sold for nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for fun".
Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into his prior borrowing arrangements.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of borrowing <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 from his London property at his constituency home he purchased in 1991, the year before he became a member of parliament.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was claiming about GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March of last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The RBS variable standard interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, unchanged since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his post as head of the shadow cabinet in September after an undercover reporter allegedly filmed him declaring that members of parliament must survive “on budget” after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated like "the m...e"
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil trader, began having to explain his spending in May, after it emerged that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the bureau that it “could be considered excessive.”
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3>-shaped hole in Mr Duncan’s lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had asked for <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved by both the fee office and Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of stealing or drafting or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn’t be simpler or simpler.”
Faithful, come all to see the Brighton Advent calendar
Brighton Beach Cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 homeowners to decorate their cabins for each December day, using Christmas carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, as visitors were allowed to visit the last booth, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., every day, with p<0xC3><0xA2>tés and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël", for which the booth presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christianity society.
"As a Church, why do we wait for people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
“The idea for the beach cabin Advent calendar came right after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner party.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to experience and represent that through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on tackling global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police carried out several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, tasked with reaching by Friday a deal that can enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has helped to make "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital came shortly after the procession left, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, an AFP reporter found.
Riot policemen immediately intervened without hesitation.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had notably exemplified themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", noting that a hundred of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night" "handcuffed and held in a seated position despite the extreme cold".
Party of Parliament, the procession, rather good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, site of negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue raincoat, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying to ourselves: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, wearing bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators were also held to call for strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, as Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russo-Georgian War for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout was 58 per cent a few hours before the close, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
This election is a farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, meanwhile, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which left several thousand dead, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said to AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region of sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the course of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, especially the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes agreements with Moscow last year, such as the one handing over control of Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current power or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police, on the brink, arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Party of Parliament, the procession, generally good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, fully dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP reporter found.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without hesitation, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had notably exemplified themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We have an eye on the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while the helicopters of the security forces were turning in the sky.
The majority of the demonstrators, who came by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue raincoat, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying to ourselves: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are rivers where you can walk when you've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who were to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators were also held to call for action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The geo-history emerges reinforced from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were emerging "strengthened" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in scientific terminal.
Now, first-year students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the minister, "it is necessary to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L sectors cannot remain sub-sectors of the S, he continues, emphasizing again: "Nor have I heard many historians and intellectuals being indignant about the absence of history-geography in the terminal in the technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to remove compulsory education in S-terminal history-geography. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The minister added, however, that there was "no question" of removing the philosophy of the S-terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest the project, which according to them sacrifices the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will focus on their discipline, then at the end of the year an admissions test that will focus on their ability to teach, explained the minister.
They will also follow internships in situation during the year of M2 then will be a first year in front of the students as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, that is more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in the National Education".
It also reaffirms the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, took up on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a sequence of expert interventions, of fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, said an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish of the school basin.
Some twenty speakers are chosen from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke without notes, but using graphs, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that listeners will note that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos taken from these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delayed payments: anger of prison overseers, planned actions
Unions of prison guards on Friday called for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of the year of bonuses and overtime hours whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of prisons and "block them", to "denounce the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night, Sunday and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of monitors, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (UFAP/UNSA), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Prison Administration Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime hours increased significantly in 2009 and were not all budgeted, but ensure that the remaining hours will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am not unaware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not happen again in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meager, except for the management personnel who benefit from the famous functions and objectives premiums, lamented Ufap / Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have good backs".
This is a pure scandal, the FO interregional union of Marseille indignantly announced its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and public holidays if those of the month of October are not regularized in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we increase our tasks and our missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take the money of the staff, believes the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some being less poorly matched than others.
But in any case the account is not there, noted the secretary general of the UFAP, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama says he's offering "more cool stuff" than he gets for Christmas
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, told Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule about gifts: “I give more beautiful things than I get.”
As part of a special show that will air Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer an insight into how they intend to celebrate the holiday season in their prestigious new home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be on the side.
The Santa Claus also likes Bo, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama has gone against her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Certainly not, I gave you some nice gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to concede before replying with humor, pointing to the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you this?”
During this one-hour show, in a laid-back atmosphere, with the celebrated host who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father he rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember that time when I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn’t know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday rehabilitated, RTL says he's in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the herniated disc suffered in Paris on November 26, his press service said, adding that the injuries had "needed a repair operation".
The singer's press service was reassuring, however, that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated at the latest within 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was however plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the condition of the patient when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by AFP, the press service neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that “according to some sources” no drains would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The procedure, scheduled for several days, was performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic field.
It was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for an infection following the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close relative of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but said he was "not worried" about the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He had called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because to fly twelve hours after such an operation is not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, was reassuring, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "reduced".
Camus also said he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a crash on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on from a "small colon cancer" and then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health issue has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulty of the singer to move on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/petit bassin: Bousquet's debut on his fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medallist at the Worlds-2009 in large pool, won an international title on Thursday on a distance that he particularly loves, the 50 m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 in small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records broken while waiting for a surge.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 swims relay.
A regret for Bousquet, who scored on the world record of the 50 m freestyle, of which he owns the mark in large pool (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m freestyle, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world record (20.30) as he had envisioned.
We can always dream better and in this case, I had said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the suits did not serve this time to the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in large basin this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower his 400m freestyle mark (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by signing the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give up on this race.
I knew I couldn’t break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann said.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged to French writer Emile Zola was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, significantly above its estimate, art dealer Sotheby's said.
This two-meter-long, 63-cm-high front panel, dating from the 3rd century A.D., was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola goes back a few days.
The panel remained for nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in her Parisian mansion, and in Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
It was a 50-year-old area of shadow.
While searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Abortion attempt by Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico on Thursday considered that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused a safe conduct by the putschist government.
At the moment, after a phone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for achieving this transfer are not met, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived Wednesday in El Salvador to bring back Mr. Zelaya, the Mexican government plane has returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
The putschist government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad in order to grant him safe conduct.
But the deposed president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as a visiting acting head of state.
The putschist government “has experienced another failure in wanting me to resign my office (...), they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, Interior Minister of the putschist government Oscar Raul Matute told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya had replied in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to take place as president of the Honduran people, he said.
Rumours of Zelaya's departure had mobilized supporters of the ousted president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their headquarters.
Brazil’s Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the government’s stance.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who approached Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, was ousted on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on September 21 and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" whose justice accuses him, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Fuels Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures testifying to the recovery in activity by both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technology-dominant Nasdaq rose 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focused on “half-full glass.”
Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, said investors focused on U.S. trade balance figures, "which show that business is improving in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts had expected the deficit to increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of major U.S. trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new jobless enrollments in the United States rose against expectations last week, to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to its lowest level in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday evening and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492 percent from 4.408 percent the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of Power Supporters Conspire to 'Ladies in White'
A few hundred supporters of Cuban power on Thursday conspired with wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were spit out in the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist found.
Downstairs the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, with the fist raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
They were escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had been held against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by plainclothes police, an AFP journalist found.
The police forcefully drove the dissidents into civilian vehicles who were conspu<0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xB5>es by government supporters, according to this journalist.
Interpellations of dissidents in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is one of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain under lockdown.
Cuban authorities regard opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” on the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
Man kills 80-year-old man with knife, injures 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and wounded five others in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of affluence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the aggressor, 28 years old, allegedly hit with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy at 85 boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, it has been learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Gravely injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to an officer of the Alliance police union, died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of that same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, about thirty years old, stepped in and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian died.
The other injured man's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, police sources said.
The pregnant woman then became uneasy and was reportedly hospitalized “in shock,” according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
He would have injured two bystanders, apparently randomly: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old, the latter seriously.
The script was confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher's knives that he was carrying in a cross behind his back, explained on the spot an official of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies gathered by AFP, have tried to control the bully.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was strong, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, said.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Still boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, at the height of n<0xC2><0xB0>61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to intercept the gunman and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Some passers-by came to tell me that there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I noticed a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person in his thirties arrived, wounded by a knife.
It was members of the national police who arrested the man without identity papers.
The prosecutor's office of Nanterre referred the investigation to the departmental judicial police service of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in custody.
A police source did not rule out being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to master him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the forceful of this species whose forces multiply tenfold under the effect of action".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for prosecution to be dropped
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), the abandonment of the proceedings against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years of morals.
Chad Hummel, the “Pianiste” director’s lawyer, denounced serious procedural errors before three judges of California’s Second District Court of Appeal at the time of the events in 1977.
I am calling for charges to be dropped here and now, Hummel said, adding that the behavior of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since passed away -- would have discussed his sentence with a prosecutor who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved jail -- which is a serious procedural flaw.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells finally said in late September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refuses to drop the proceedings, Mr. Hummel has called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentencing, for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Assistant Attorney General Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be there to appear at the hearing.”
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to flee?, Ms. Asayama asked.
She said the filmmaker was "asking the court for a favor while scorning its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed "that there were other alternatives to flight."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one asking for Roman Polanski's prosecution to be dropped.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, has also once again called for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client can no longer stand to be harassed at every turn in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, held back by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market torn between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped to improve market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery,” analysts at Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also rebounded sharply in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan Index.
However, indices have been held back by a further rise in the dollar, the highest in two months against the euro, which “pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday evening and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497 % against 4.492 % the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of traveling across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are set to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great beauty mass organized for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss sportive or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I’ve seen so many things and lived so many experiences!, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, underlines Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
Indiana Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
It’s every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimsuit.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates did as last year a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the June 2010 FIFA World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been hanging out with people I never thought I could get close to.
I will definitely be back for the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," his son David said on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he was due to go to his father's bedside hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he left the plane that was taking him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, who looks relaxed, said he would go "very quickly" to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following a herniated disc surgery on Nov. 26 in Paris.
The singer was “put in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment,” the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection following a herniated disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is schooled, to attend a school show, an AFP photographer found.
The head of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at La Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
“I’ve heard of a possible court proceeding to come,” he said.
According to Camus, Hallyday had “departed much too quickly for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon.”
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it stunned me, given that I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "departed without drain, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma following a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, condemned several times by the court, in cases of medical liability, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr David Koubbi.
He said the intervention was "perfectly successful" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been multiplying since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8th (in Amiens, ed) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association raises the tone and calls on the New Center to stop using its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, reacted Friday to the attempt of OPA of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the ex-party Giscardien, warning him to no longer use it on any medium, under penalty of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, judging that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of the MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP passed to the NC) who claims ownership of the brand UDF for having been the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou who do not want to be dispossessed, came out of his silence to issue a formal notice to the minister and the deputy, telling them to no longer use the acronym and to transmit to them the property of the brand, under penalty of prosecution.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement to +resume + the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it was good to have the name of this movement, the +New Center+, of the slogan +Today's UDF+, follow on your militant material and on the guard page of your site, also note the signatories of the letter.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office, which urges the NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) trademark to its legitimate beneficiaries".
If you did not, the courts would be brought to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF "is a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "chosen" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The Nouveau centre therefore has no right, according to them, to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its membership in the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office charged with defending "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He takes scandalously and fraudulently advantage of the absence of filing the acronym UDF to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicateness is turning into a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier in order to determine, as accused by the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian to strip her of a part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the prosecutor's office of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010, stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she'll submit to it.
I will tell him about it, said Mr. Georges Kiejman, Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer.
For his part, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who must be protected, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has been pursuing criminal charges against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and touch-to-everything artist, whom she accuses of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court was supposed to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleas sometimes turned to the big family unpacking on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer referred to three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was wary of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise, I have never been able to talk to her since her marriage.”
For its part, the prosecutor's office in Nanterre again considered that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge in recent days refused to comply with her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, the public prosecutor's representative.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees has been a reminder of the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of getting employees to adhere to certain "values" from above as it once was, of imposing on consumers products designed by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering markets back in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the factors of customer preferences returns regularly!
Employee demobilization can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously jeopardizes the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, even more, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that authoritarian management revenues totally contradict.
This is why we are calling for a management revolution that would put employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion polls – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incite this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I have been able to see that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally gets, after many detours, to do as a priority... what it has always done.!
Secondly, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr strengthens the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies requires adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a way to realize part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
At present, only studies from the Reasoning Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "in place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: 'just war' deserves praise from right-wing Obama
The US right-wing welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner had defended the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who brocaded the award to Mr. Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, a right-wing Republican, told USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the issue of “sometimes necessary” war in her newly published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop these terrorists all over there, she said.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
In some ways, I found this speech quite historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former Elect, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush converted columnist at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it", said Gerson.
Among the few on the right to be unconvinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "slow, blistered and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed that Barack Obama justified the use of force.
When we wrap war in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, continued to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech “overproduction” even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California daily said.
Obama "spoke the right speech," the New York Times said, describing it as "dark and uplifting at the same time."
Road racers: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon-negotiation sessions, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organization to have remained to the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that puts an end to the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" of this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of talks, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to quickly sign the text of the agreement at the end of the morning.
And this even if three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting started at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "there was concern that it would disrupt the holiday season," Bussereau said.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wage earners, "we increase from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not a big deal, but we're starting from very far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we are going to give our militants the order that there be no blockades, no blockades of the supply centers.
But we can still have some recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, praised "a good deal", although it was "difficult to concede the increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) called it an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel expenses by 3%, and the holding of general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow, in particular, to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of 100 million euros in employer expenses" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finances law for 2009, voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in identical terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply firstly to the companies affiliated to this organization, and secondly, to the whole profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done “as soon as possible,” Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "market of fools", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, lamented the Unostra.
For the Other, the agreement risks "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruptions on the RER A, France's largest urban transit line, will continue over the weekend, as a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry for their premium claim.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10:00 and 20:00, at the rate of one train out of two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one out of four trains outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, was delighted that "RATP is making efforts to serve department stores".
The RER A crosses from west to is the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran during peak hours, and almost no trains at off-peak hours, as expected.
As on Thursday, there was no rush on the quays, the Franciliens having organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially due to the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, said he had woken up "an hour and thirty earlier, to make sure he got there on time".
The Saint-Lazare station has not experienced saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned a supervision of agents and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "thin" by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The RRN Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RRN A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT said, emphasizing that the management "had not failed to solve a problem while it is done with the truckers and the SNCF".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of practice of the profession," the RATP said.
The trade unions were also told that the company “makes fun of weekend users.”
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which until then had refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in the interest of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to the RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Indépendants.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line to the million daily travelers.
The drivers of RER, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for shifted hours, on Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish judiciary dissolves pro-Kurdish party, decision with serious consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday declared the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision risks greatly complicating the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "home of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Court President Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was made unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows proceedings launched in 2007 by the Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the “directives” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, says it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, in an attempt to curtail Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have escalated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as the justice was announced, a thousand demonstrators gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city mostly populated by Kurds.
Police fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deepen despair.”
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning a party, he told reporters.
The government, formed by an Islamist party, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
That doesn’t solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
One can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Braubburger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sanding service (FES) says that it is not to bother citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn to master them well.
And according to the statologists, it could well be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle snow and ice.
The EDF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow over the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles run 20 main routes (called A routes).
This includes high traffic streets, main thoroughfares, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire escapes, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
The EDF officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1,040 kilometers of road must be salted with a road surface that adheres well, in a maximum of 3 hours.
This is why the EDF service starts at 3 a.m. "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic begins".
Where it gets harder is when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the clearing and sanding service of the roads "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it does not snow anymore, we take care of the access roads and the service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary lanes and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger is well aware that this always leads to a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the EDF pedestrian team set off to clear priority areas deemed dangerous and crossings.
As for cycle paths, EDF services are generally unable to deal with them.
Mr Brauburger pointed out that there is a special service in Frankfurt which is responsible for monitoring the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4:30 a.m.
As ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police use this special service when needed.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
The Tawa hahae resembled the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long and 1.50 meters high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues report in Thursday’s Science magazine, Tawa hahae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the land of the supercontinent, the Pangaea, and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa illuminates a new day in the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the kinship links, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team says they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating back to the Triassic.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories regarding the early evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indian word for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bones.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular, but he points out that it confirms certain theories regarding the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the Saurians divided themselves into three major groups of evolution: the theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptor that appeared later and from which descend the birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds with long necks, and those related to them, and the herbivores of which the trinithischians are part.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found evidence that Tawa hajdae possessed small air sacs in its skull bones, as did birds that are the offspring of theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in the Tawa hahae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
As the related lineage of the huge sauropods also possessed aerial sacs and a light frame, it may be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that Saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three great lines of evolution split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. the entire land area that formed the supercontinent Pangaea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to him.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History in New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the Silesaurus, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong view because there are in South America a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while practically none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs became the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch remains a mystery to this day.
At the time of the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of modern crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread across the planet, favoring the development of many new species while others, related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favored the blossoming of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and that since that time had been in the shadows: they were mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec City, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the casino of the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and professors from the J.W. Goethe University and other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English theycondemn the intervention of the police demanded by the university's steering committee.
Last week, University President Werner Müller-Estler evacuated buildings occupied by striking students and teachers after walls and artwork were scrambled with graffiti.
Five students were injured in the evacuation.
The signatories said the damage did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own classes."
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable breach" of freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and tries to make the reasons for the mobilization forget.
The Steering Committee of the University has thus withdrawn itself from the debates which, however, would be indispensable.
The lecturers demand that criminal prosecutions be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the services sector and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary at the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) , she took action for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept the vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition SPD parliamentary groups, the Greens and the Left (Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the party La Gauche (Linke)
Instead of reflecting on the students’ arguments and demands, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion urging the Minister of the Interior to deliver a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new “Silicon-valley”
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of secret armament research, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the town has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
There are important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics.
In September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, the place of the Frankfurt sciences – with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of close collaboration".
The signatories were Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, head of the project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchanges
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific societies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
It is home to the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the large firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be high enough.
For its supporters, it is nothing less than “the new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, much more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a despairing chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The head-to-head stations, with tracks ending in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that acted as a brake on modern rail traffic because it once took a lot of time to get the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you have to do.
This is why the main stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Railroad between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realisation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, the head-to-head stations no longer pose any real entry and exit problems since there are modern trains, reversible with railcars and driver cars at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now launched next to the new inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies prevailed.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who bears the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the federal republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphics of the computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The transit station and section expansion are designed for human trafficking to which enormous growth was attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s -.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic because transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new layout, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be lacking for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
The Ministry of Transport lists 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the widening of the section through the Rhine Valley by 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom here thoroughly.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake shoe.
The Rhine Valley route is becoming a bottleneck for international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the ruling on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night air flights.
Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to review the Administrative Tribunal's ruling from a legal point of view, which is a more than 400-page document.
The Court of Cassel had argued in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event that the planned construction of the northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport takes place.
Landing permission for 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nocturnal air nuisance.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 if it wants to make a cassation appeal against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticised the deadline and tried to pressure the government representative to dismiss the appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel calls on the CDU and the FDP to return to their pre-election promise to ban night flights, otherwise it will be seen as a total breach of a given word.
It’s fucking hard to be allowed to keep your word, Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP’s election slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's reproaches that the Land government is still trying to authorize night flights using "avocados and rublardises".
It takes time to complete a specific legal examination.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "quick first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its faction's statements on the ban on night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. banks reimburse aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, are losing their ties to the state.
Bank of America said on Wednesday it had fully reimbursed the treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid provided under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also considering reimbursing the aid.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses allocated to managers as well as the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the money comes from the bank's cashiers, which are well-filled thanks to the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the CEO of the Bank of America, expressed his thanks to the American taxpayers: the capital injection has helped considerably to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup also plans to procure money on the financial markets in order to free itself from state tutelage.
The U.S. bank could launch a capital increase of $20 billion as of Thursday, CNBC reported citing banking circles.
The Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment on this information.
In June, banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley reimbursed the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
In the end, everything went faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin-based ZDF newsroom, was the big favorite.
However, the channel did not want to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further harm ZDF Intendant Markus Schächter in case the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 members of the Commission.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had voted in favour of Brender's reappointment and seven others had voted against, and the impeachment by vote of Brender was a far-fetched but predictable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which has a majority on the Board of Directors, had already hinted several weeks before the vote, not wanting to return Brender to his position.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the esteemed editor-in-chief, citing the fact that the rate of listening to ZDF news broadcasts had fallen under Brender.
This is the reason why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, criticizing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 public law experts who had meddled in the debate and who felt that Koch's course of action was unconstitutional.
But it would have been useless.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate radio organ) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily newspaper of national scope).
In 1983 he became editor at the ZDF first at the news magazine "heute-journal" (today's newspaper).
Then his career continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then Washington correspondent in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (two-monthly news program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of the ZDF then head of the Berlin editorial board.
After the disgrace of Brender, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialist magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the board, Rhineland-Palatinate's Minister-President Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not consider asking for the removal of political figures from the ZDF’s oversight committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's probable successor, had skillfully maneuvered with the board of directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to fire Brender.
With this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of parties, Frey is classified as a left-liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was reached stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the examinations: a single examination should close the chosen module of study.
In addition, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder are also committed to arranging more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master courses.
At regional level, there should be no different regulations from one Land to another.
Fewer Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have constantly spoken of the fashionable expression: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module must normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", reads a 30-page document on future admission conditions to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop slippages, which had a significant impact on studyability.
Moreover, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background must be examined carefully to see if we can not avoid this feeling of choking that sometimes we feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should “have the opportunity and room for manoeuvre to enable and foster personal initiative.”
The new regulations will cover access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "re-accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is not until 2015 that all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education put some pressure on the Länder to put a strain on the agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the examination regime not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized graduate schools have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is the only state to have so far agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programmes and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and international relations department.
The Länder and universities provide a budget of 10 million euros for this.
In early 2010, the government wanted to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, you will only have to pass one exam to complete your studies.
The organisation of studies will have to be more flexible, and the recognition of transcripts from other institutions of higher education must be guaranteed and access to the Master's must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of conditions of study in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but criticism was voiced.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has indicated that he would like the organization of education policy to no longer take place in the future "behind closed doors" of Ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as affected persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of the students is very useful to us", she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, furthermore asks that the Länder ensure today's Bachelor students that there will be tomorrow enough places for Master's studies and conditions of study as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that a work by the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in fragments of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany and gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later a collection director at a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received several literary prizes; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm artist's house in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about himself in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
In 1989, Söllner received the German Language Award together with some of the participants.
The enlistment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, Söllner concludes, "so someone who has not been able to withstand enough of the Securitate's intimidation trials."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize honoring Herta Müller and her exemplary literary tangles with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abysses and baseness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, to the best of our knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own dossier Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He was able to pull him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for Securitate spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of his own file.
It can be assumed that the victims have speculated and sometimes guessed which real names were hiding last the names of borrowed Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where the consultation of Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confusing.
Systematic clarification has been continually thwarted and curbed in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has rather dragged on since.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she had only been questioned once.
The infamy of power thought that it could express itself here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Admittedly, many unavoidable questions are associated with the Söllner case as it happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been robbed? The weighted reaction of the listeners, to Söllner's admission, gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Unrest in the Champions League
It felt like a four-pin representative was coming in from a nice Christmas party, on which the sporting goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross climbed at midnight minus the quarter in a Mercedes C-class, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in hand.
The man, whose bald head attracted attention, let himself be led into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our fiftieth-year-old could have gotten behind the wheel himself – he hadn’t drunk alcohol and he wasn’t drunk with happiness either.
We had a good night, but we had to get back to work tomorrow.
'Cause now it was about to start.
The words of the Swiss three days earlier were clear: “We have reached the eighth final”, that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania “but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back”.
The "big job" awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is a matter of repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Lottery draw
The Champions League final round of 16/17. + 23./24 February/9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the fulminant entry into office of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderated by the lucky one, who had given the destabilized Stuttgart professionals unwavering motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "leader of souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good but that no longer had any effect with the healer Babbel.
Jens Lehmann, a Babbel supporter, said: “In football, when there is a new impulse, sometimes things happen that we would never have thought possible.
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of pause for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the method of work of the new leader: "He is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet crossed the line, warns manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart mainly needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later having a bad wake-up call at Leverkusen with the 0:4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We haven't made it through the hard road yet.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday did not have the heart to party, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the weekend events that a televised interview of goaltender Jens Lehmann rebounded just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered, in response to Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the leadership of style weakness and said she had decided to change coaches under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the matches had been removed from him.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt said, announcing consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life these two forty-year-olds.
In any case, they agreed on everything else, that is to say, without the previous work of the group by the replaced coach, the strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for a large part in the success” replied Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the man with the plastic bag acquiesced.
World Heavyweight Championships
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger was constantly verbally and gesturally provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
Unanimously, the judges agreed to the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a points victory in the judges' unanimity against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has defended his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of World Champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited knockout.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional fights, had to admit twice his loss due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th match.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his left counter.
Johnson, eleven centimetres smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the blows of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing his dangerous right-wing into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having surpassed the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko by calling him a "bad zombie" who is "not really capable".
During the weighing on Friday, the champion couldn’t help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose “so he could see his eyes.”
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth match since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a hit in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it was the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye had canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was scheduled to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is now planning to have this game played at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz Affair
Opposition frontal attack: Greens parliamentary group leader Jürgen Trittin has accused Defence Minister Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz case.
The SPD and La Gauche (Linke) parties are asking the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a counter-truth" about the deadly attack on two tankers last September, Greens parliamentary group leader Jürgen Trittin said Saturday during the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
In other words, it means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO, which has been read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the aim of the strike was actually not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the US airstrike that was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak as soon as possible before the federal parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government if the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery has in no way influenced the army’s interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing louder to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given Guttenberg about the tanker attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they allegedly hid the existence of the NATO report and hid some annoying details from the Minister.
In the entourage of the two senior officials, however, it is implied that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert has in the meantime asked in a letter for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the ministry declined to comment on the charges and referred the matter to the federal parliament's commission of inquiry, which was set to convene the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can indulge unhindered in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, he who, awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, soon has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychic patients or under the effect of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best case it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect are distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of neurotransmitter substances in the brain – primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – breaks down and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earth's force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreaming.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awake; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 noted "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T transforms into a comic book character.
Her body is in two dimensions with bright colors.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over him, he hovers over the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him are winged, grimaceous devil creatures with bloody mouths, showing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Voices thundering, nasty, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. rips two cables from his stereo chain, makes it a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and runs the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop is detached.
Let it teach you, the voices in a choir shout to rip out his eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizoaffective psychosis, paranoid, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despairs.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers at least once in their lifetime from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, those affected can no longer tell the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitation, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry at the Heidelberg University Hospital ( Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in your life.
Unlike dreaming, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved."
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brains make these kind of cabriolets, is always a riddle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to momentarily lose perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
The researchers assume that the people involved have tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is the way the neural system anomaly occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory imagery for the past ten years: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that in some conditions even the brains of healthy people are prone to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain warms up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimuli, stress, heartbreak or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admit to having experienced hallucination at least once in their life.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to high school.
A young girl to do normal to tell the truth.
If there weren't the images and the voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, addresses him.
When she answers, her comrades look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, she is sure of it.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even sense his presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young man sympathetic.
Am I crazy? she wonders sometimes.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to take the class because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations on the board.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that comes too rarely and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimaceous faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she cries out to these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or her friends, they'd think she'd be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her degree last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she got in touch with psychologist Kasten via the internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is high that they will hallucinate after a certain time.
I suppose the brain not being busy enough, makes sure there is animation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was a child and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called dad, since she was of the age of thought, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between dreaming and hallucination.
In our too-conscious world, we are sadly quick to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of dream-awakened consciousness modification.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully aware and experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that damages his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dreaming and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity that is given to us men so as not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memory.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the moment when his conscious leaves for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; meanwhile, his body is condemned to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from the ground up, visiting foreign places, traveling back in time. He sees himself as an old man lying in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes, describing what he experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than actual experience.
The intensity of this experience makes the horizon of our other daily experiences burst, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly determined to integrate into society, Hubert Burda, 69, told the Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
We will also have to see if they are able to do so.
One cannot impose one’s children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda announced last Thursday that he was stepping down as President and CEO in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he was in charge of the treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over the marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old respectively, her son Felix, who would have been 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves to make the connection for the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda states that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
Ruins have always taken place in families that have been driven by a bulimia of capital, who have made huge, unfortunate speculations that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I have never dreamed of universal power, Burda said.
I don't see myself in the role of coach of the country as Springer could be and I don't intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on much too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the goal that seems to have been set El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the mall of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a power station, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and to relax thanks to a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facials, body treatments and hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching), are enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after making our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Diverse necklines
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona are getting an electric car
The electricity company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, has created the “Oficina LIVE”.
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The <0xC2><0xAB> Oficina LIVE » (Logistics for the Implantation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implantation of the electric car in the city and will set up agreements regarding mobility, carrying out steps, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the implementation of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a set of complementary projects in progress such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a future of tranquility” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, sees "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, constitutes the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production sites,” said the President of the Government.
“Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), has dedicated 800 million euros to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized an investment of more than 3 000 million euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment is aimed at both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, alluding to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with Autonomous Communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of collectible cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collectible Cars, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabell<0xC3><0xB3>n de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only will you be able to find motorcycles and classic cars, but you will also find at ClassicAuto Madrid items of any kind related to the world of the engine.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos de Mos and Good Old Times, automotive sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, automotive sales and catering, or Cochera Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Ability test outdoors
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit set up outside the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sporting spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated in the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 2.0 gasoline engine of 150 hp.
This second generation Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the cockpit, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the cockpit, this compact Japanese car has more than enough room to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Add to all this a large chest with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-litre, 150-horsepower petrol engine and with manual six-speed transmission.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most popular Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not drive a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its great speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, in other words the one that has the largest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipment, the Lane Change Assistant (RVM) which removes dead angle, traction and stability controls, cruise control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as outstanding 17-wheels.
In addition, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes among other elements adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
In particular, it is illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive many kilometers a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version combined only with the 2.0 petrol engine of 150 hp.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
“First” Luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our “Pe”, as sophisticated as it is customary, had opted for a dark “lady”.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your email, without offering the possibility even to see certain types of attachments or browse the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what it costs, for example, the data subscription of the iPhone.
Due to its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life, six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandfather, but comes with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, around 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly appealing and has long been expected to work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read small characters.
The European Commission’s repeated calls for affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside of his home country, we are hesitant to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have Wifi) offers this type of rates, means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no galley.
It is a connected device and you pay when you buy it, not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with lifetime access as Peek already offers in the US.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I want it simply because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Favorite Color
Yellow is arguably the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and coat of this color, she chose, in fact, the same to accompany him in the second moment, without a doubt, the most important of his life: the award in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with bright reflections, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So that at a first glance, it seems that the First Lady of the United States is following in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the takeover it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she carried in Oslo a printed velvet.
The accessories are also different: green mid-heeled shoes for the first time, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised while she wore it loose the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Women's Fertility and Professional Career in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have had limited professional careers due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in a couple and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of job occupied.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier, and have more children.
On the other hand, women in stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are refusing entry into married life and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the date of beginning of joint life, "explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35- to 49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher education were first-time mothers at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
"Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary school get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and prioritize obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child,” says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several of the brand’s products, chanting the universal motto “Because I’m worth it”.
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's Ace Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither fears nor enlightenment.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reads and rereads.
Here are a few snapshots.
In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the very one I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.
On Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him.”
Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven by the way of perdition.”
About James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed from the north face, on which the best climbers still and always let go."
William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were grandiose.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer gathered the insane cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the end of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did it in the flight of himself and invoking posteriority with a violent speech to the asticots."
Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed, ‘Beloved God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.’
On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after effort, / after the storm the port, / rest after the war, / after life, tired death raves."
On Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband would normally accept that she told him that Edward VII spied on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent exceeded madness.
On P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do if not to try to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What's Benet trying to do but get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did it do other than aspire to the glory of this man to serve as a pedestal for him?”
A Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a melee-blood, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they gave her two kicks that left the dog grievously.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what fun it is to attack for free a small defenseless animal that, moreover, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetician who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, in the end, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog moaned all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint with the district police station even though we doubt that this is useful for much and in order not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s going on with young people so they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for wearing the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said that this campaign is in line with its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products” and affirmed that it contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets on two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to figures from the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
The good news, however, is that the reference for comparison, in November 2008, was particularly poor, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite last month's rebound, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The large clouds that affect demand the most have not dissipated, because, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank loans, other factors must be added, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In view of this situation and in contrast to passenger vehicles, aid for the purchase of the 2000E was of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed people and SMEs who wish to purchase a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated.
The dealers' association expects a year 2010 similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As happened with the ABS anti-lock brake system and as will happen with the ESP stability check, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory feature on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, due to its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The Emergency Brake Assist works by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident were unable to press the brake before the collision, and half of them did not take advantage of its full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revenge, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with these types of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although a collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragossa) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it will need more time to finalize the plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
At GM, however, a decision on the sale of Saab is expected to be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of Dutch sports car maker Skyper, backed by Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and most precious jewel, Porsche engineers took off from the Boxster S and managed to slim it down by as little as 80 kilos, leaving the balance at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual tarpaulin roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos of gains, to mount 12 kilos of sports bags.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on California secondary network roads, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous bends.
His behavior can only be described as irreproachable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from driving on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in corners, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for the necessary time, until we asked him to sprinter, brake, recover and push his engine again...
It's out what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands on the steering wheel will indicate.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The accelerator capacity is brutal, whether at standstill or during recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road surface we covered with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely made a note of presence throughout the journey, while on some corners we found ice in the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
An intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer displays her face as bad as her Chanel bags.
More than a “bad girl” or an “it girl,” it’s a “bag girl.”
Baskonia wins in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the tough terrain of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. She is thus at the top of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets to three points was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, even if it had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, hinted that they had jumped on the Israeli field with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received with cheers and applause back at his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to get noticed as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although the "minus six" rating of Splitter already hinted that this night was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's that they did not win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini decisively contributed to the yellows taking advantage of the luminous (50-49).
Other Difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed to follow up some skillful actions to get some fresh air, and it was at this point that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared, which, with three baskets to three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas gave the counter to a third-quarter finish (54-67).
Avala's team came out to play the whole thing for the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not let anyone take what they had deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis got closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped to Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and handed him the head of Euroleague Group B in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion or by the size of the rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, made it possible to make the Andalusians dream, an aggressive defense and three baskets to three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by Unicaja's intensity, although the home team's arsenal with Bourousis' home game, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, helped to topple the 22-20 score, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a brawling start, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led the team to the finals.
The Greek team began to function by showing their superiority on both sides, while the injury exit of English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
The domestic players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 lead in the nineteenth minute.
An Impossible Rise
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match played at Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, causing the group to chance the head of the group.
The Unicaja were trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to their organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis's support, left some hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was virtually impossible as Olympiacos proved relentless when players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian center Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of real estate, job and vehicle classifieds in Spain.
The “How Much Should You Be Paid?” tool calculates users’ salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, years of experience, age and the city where you want to work.
For the last week that the app has been working, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels badly paid,” Trovit’s product manager Albert Ribera said in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovit<0xC3><0xA0> from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, while a Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year, followed by that of seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet over the past three months are driver, part-time and social worker jobs.
Brazil set a departure date for Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, a business manager for Brazil's embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his mandate, he must look for another destination."
The channel also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile imposed on him by the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After rosy days since last spring, during which asset inflation has been the dominant note in the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by nature uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalized and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, are starting to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB did, with their one-year auction next week.
As a result, investors are doubting the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely hit by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened with a further downward revision of the Kingdom of Spain's qualification.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence moral risk advocates, who were once again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for global economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of credit limitation on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to return to power in the emirates, and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we find ourselves facing an episode of transitional risk premium normalization, after a few excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our public debt gaps increase to the extent of European corporate bonds, we do not have to worry.
If Europe's gaps were to shrink and ours were to continue to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most research services to anticipate their recovery models and to upwardly revise their forecasts for 2011, plus the OECD and the European Commission, which are returning to the burden with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not bode much for their warning.
Again, this looks like a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for now “prudence is the mother of safety”.
Connected Sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n outlined for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, at eight-closures.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros until 2020 and 60,000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that the nuclear power plants currently in operation would remain open.
If this were not the case, the necessary investments would not be 60,000 million but 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change, and power will need to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW more are needed, along with other “supporting energies”.
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the draft law on sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with what his company demands, did not want to attack the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to fight against global warming.
According to him, there is “a clear long-term bet” in this sense, despite the “one-off” measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that decisions to invest, although they are long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time before they reach maturity and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market at 10 airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Center.
The alliance expects an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on highways and at airports.
Acciona disputes its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway under concession in Australia, a market in which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The project is an estimated AUD 1,700 million (approximately EUR 1,047 million) tunnel.
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway concessionaire.
The city council wants to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the tutelage of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be in charge of the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia are facing each other, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of Australia's largest manufacturers, while the latter, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is formed, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium to pass the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction sites and privatizations, but entering them is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
This strategy has been followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which still remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a spot in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona focuses on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link, is expected to connect the western Toowong Highway to the ring road at Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel, the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two double lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers jobs in Hochtief
Australia continues to make a large contribution to Hochtief, who yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fibre-optic broadband network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company sold the project to build the 27-storey King George Tower in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet started and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC awarded tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of €64.5 million.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after being tasked with the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Sra. Rushmore awarded Renfe advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from among 16 agencies that submitted to the tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA which was responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by loyalty programs to consumers on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore a repeat infringer.
An app store
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company followed in the footsteps of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from the transmission of voices.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will take until 2010 for it to reach other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has earned 476.4 million at Real Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have won 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place among the clubs that have pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
Indeed, the competition distributed €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the tournament's inception, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this split.
The white club was the third on the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And this, although they lost in front of Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of money brought in by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution (disambiguation)
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA's complex money-sharing procedure.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the qualifying matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each game played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and tie (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth round receive three million each, the eight teams that arrive in the quarterfinal receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, as part of the fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a pocketed $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, and has four seats.
The previous year's champion pockets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday listed the details of the offer to buy shares through which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public takeover bid (OPA) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerez Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing the restructuring of its management.
In an attempt to stay out of potential takeover bids and the judicial back and forth of her former directors, the brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luis Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals further embezzlement of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the loan to the Salazars, former Councillors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of the JCC and Unicaja) told the National Audience yesterday that they had been informed of the embezzlement of 212 million without knowing the destination.

New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and calculating parts cost and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest IT tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of claims assessment and maintenance services and solutions are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and record its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model is established on which one can click on the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be done in a week if the process proceeds very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centers around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most common application is for repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of breakage parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for claims assessment, for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertises, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came off the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the professional sector on the Internet that allows bids on vehicles declared wrecks.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geo-demographic analyses or know common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious claims for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or car maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical benchmark product in the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, and it has generated a turnover of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is made in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange for $1,000 million; today, its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Accidental Cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles that were affected.
The transaction involved a cost of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the industry, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, breakers and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collectible cars can be re-registered, although they have been withdrawn, after complex procedures.
Garage quote in four steps
With the Auda-Workshop tool, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, find the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, increases or discounts, then he can print the quote to hand it over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalog of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
