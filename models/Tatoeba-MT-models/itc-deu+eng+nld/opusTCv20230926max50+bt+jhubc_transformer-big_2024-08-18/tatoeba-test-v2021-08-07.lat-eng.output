And Moses answered and said, What if they will not believe me, nor hearken to my voice, but will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee?
And Moses said, As thou hast spoken, so shall I see thy face no more.
And Moses said, When I go out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to Jehovah; and the thunder shall cease, and there shall be no hail, that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah's.
And Moses said, I beseech thee, O LORD, I am not a man of words from yesterday and from henceforth, nor from the day that thou spakest unto thy servant: for I am a slow man, and a slow man of my tongue.
And Moses said, If thou also wilt offer us sacrifices and burnt offerings, which we shall offer unto the LORD our God, yet our flocks shall go with us: there shall not a hoof of them be left: for we will take of them to do the service of the LORD our God: for we know not what we shall offer until we come thither.
