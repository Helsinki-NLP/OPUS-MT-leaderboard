Parliament did not ratify the amendment for Tymosenko's release
The Ukrainian parliament rejected, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs rejected at second reading the proposed amendment to reduce penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors to freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for entering into an a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court is due to rule on the sentenced woman's appeal in December.
Tymosenko calls the regime's political revenge judgment and has provoked a process of suspicions of court bias also in the west.
The proposed annulment of paragraph 365 of the Criminal Law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Category: Libyan victories
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to be determined the winners.
As is customary in the region, the victors in the elections are Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals?
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of Sharia and we already know what it is about.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a flight you cut off your hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, the possible disrespectful of the faith are liable to the death penalty...
It is the Qur'an that will unite in place of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya such an order will reign as we cannot represent it to ourselves and as we surely would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, objectively not the best, and would probably not be of benefit to Libyans.
It is especially astonishing that the Islamist warriors accepted the help with recognition of the infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with every attack.
So when it comes to looking for the victors in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our poilitics turned away from the dictator as a political ally without profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
There is therefore no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crusaders".
Without land occupation, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of self-interested protection of human rights.
As long as we don't have those Sharia followers.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states has published GDP-related information for the 3As.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market breaks all records.
Investors are looking not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries published their economic development visions for the third quarter earlier.
Germany’s GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, while France’s GDP is projected to grow by 0.4%.
Both countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was in a better position than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the 0.1% forecast), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was originally a question of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that there is a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts’ predictions.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to forecasts and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ forecasts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2%.
Ten-year yield on bonds is 28.45%
Returns on bonds from Spain and Italy are climbing to critical limits.
Problems are starting to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Returns on Czech bonds remain below 4% as the situation worsens in the region.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should be the guarantor of last resort .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The representation of football succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has defended heavily with good luck in the second half and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification to the European Championship.
The Montenegrins found themselves under pressure even in the second part because of a precise Czech defense.
Victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
In the first few minutes, we played football.
Both teams were struggling to assemble combinations and the game focused mainly around the center line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not manage to break through the Czech defense, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the U.S. and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan created a human shield around the nuclear technology center of Isfahan where uranium is processed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest report that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at destroying Iran’s nuclear program, the targets would be not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: does not take breakfast and takes cold cuts for dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight, 9% of schoolchildren are overweight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround it.
For example, on the tables of obese children, cured meats are found 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness campaign "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of the little fats the sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most of the schoolchildren of today - only 15% answered that at least once a week the parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever company.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third grade have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the lack of a correct diet and not enough physical exercise.
“Only half of the children surveyed reported eating breakfast 5 times a day—in case—lunch—snack—dinner, which is one of the basic principles of a good diet,” one of the survey results said.
No breakfast and cold cuts at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of the students eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats their breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been noted is that one-tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed more often.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children surveyed exercise regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diet from possibilities proposed according to their own taste and personal opinion.
“The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating.”
Among their favorite dishes are lots of cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is a high preference for sweet lemonades," the survey said.
For lunch it was the pasta that took the first place just in front of the white meat.
The children did not want starches at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Heading towards health
The survey also showed that children are willing to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a control of a group of survey participants who had filled out the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obesity is not a coincidence", we witnessed a determined desire to move towards a healthy diet," indicate the results of the survey.
The most striking was, for example, when it came to sweet lemonades as children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often checked white meat and fish as the main course and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread or potato dumplings).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn’t think about what would happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it will be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it is really "drunk".
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) dealt with how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically shrink wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We went so far as to beautifully emphasize the character and also not to dress too visibly types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between the waist and the hips in such a way that skirts or pants do not fit at all, it is worth it to have it made to measure.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in one that permanently slides, wraps around and does not fit the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I’m also afraid that given what I have to do at home, there’s too much to do.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality fashion as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Deep inside me, it makes me happy, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred kilos lately (please don't take my statement completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search on the internet, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard, as they say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking also about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses the physique but for example creates the productive pages in magazines (on given products the trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, has kept us from all this.
But this... until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diversified look to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphic designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with just one outfit in a different way.
Variability is a prime example of this.
As for example this trench coat that must be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with pumps and take a picture like a dress.
Or just tuck up the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.
“Play with it,” he said.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then start to contravene it," Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have a lot more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have ten pages (so a dozen models) I have to be ready to "cut" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to count on that in the course of creating a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes do half the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach towards the use of the services of stylists remains chilly.
And the familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seem passes to the second rank).
And if someone gets a styling done on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he dictates to us with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we have to browse on google and make sure if the news of boulevard report the celebrity in question, if it has thinned or grown etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To know how to guess people, not to flatter oneself, to keep one's opinion.
“When a manager asks you to sort her wardrobe and fill it with new items you can’t throw it all away and say, ‘My God, what a horror.’
“You’ll find a few things that you’ll find pretty and he you’ll advise on what to wear them with,” Mario says.
This one has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It is the one that you hang around the waist and that you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to the clearly defined things such as scissors, rollers for depilation or pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which you close a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of hair clips can not be worn).
So that we were not just people who listened but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resembling shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, a fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently injure ourselves.
So we really need skills.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.
The contance I'm mentioning isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second course weekend
I’m starting to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The need for speed The Run is contested throughout America.
Revision
Originally a trouble-free race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with it in a routine morning commute to work.
It fulfills everyone’s ambition to a certain extent, but it is useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new subtitled part The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the racing series Need for Speed already old and to release a kind of game from playable games that would not count only with points.
So we were curious what the added passages will be like in which the main hero gets out of his car and does whatever he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole shoots down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of incomprehensible laziness on the part of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught up in the adventure of which the main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them begins to participate in illegal races throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on a different route and the stages are planned in different environments that differ quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also quite nice even if the graphical technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
This is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumnal landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very visually pleasing.
The events are also occasionally embellished with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition to this, the different races are well arranged one after the other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then another duel with an opponent awaits you.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the passages outside the vehicle.
Rather, it’s an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away in front of someone and you have to help him by hitting the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
As a result, it is like this because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that embellish the game.
The driving pattern is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is nothing extraordinary at the moment, but it cannot be said to be negative.
As for the realistic simulation you will have to go elsewhere.
But although we can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything is ok.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not yet at the point.
We don't expect complicated deformation and collisions from this game, but when you don't have, in a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, it's not completely good.
During the tight overtakings you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your self starts in crazy agitations.
Or it ends up in crumbs.
Thanks to the reboot system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you have broken your face or you have gone out in the scenery the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 reboots.
When you have used the 5 reboots you have to start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and it is necessary to find the solution by remembering the piece of route in question.
The big draw of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are certain turns that you have to go through in a certain way otherwise it does not pass.
Otherwise you meet at a given location "civilian" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds early or one minute late.
What makes you angry are the situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and circumvent them or brake.
It does not matter if you go ahead of him because it is "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always comes very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent who precedes you in the same place.
This annoys the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long deck in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a good number of times.
It can be understood that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adredaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it doesn’t matter if it’s because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there’s no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the petrol pumps on the routes as you can change cars there however most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American displacements for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic twists on highly technical driving, for example on yawning roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know from adventure, goes very well with the main scheme of the story.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile which is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog function, which compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult moves to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speed indicator shows you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a subway train that sends the car directly to the scrap metal.
At the editorial board we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about it when creating this game or whether the authors really think we're fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What bothers me is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This especially applies to accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer of any use to you.
The sound part is good and the track is choice.
In order to please as many and especially the younger audience as possible, a new soundtrack has been created in the "I mix everything" style, but it can be expected that no one will buy the game for the music.
Need for Speed: The Run is really confusing.
If the game didn’t have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The fun is really good but be prepared for the mistakes to hit you in the eye with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs Behave Like Negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a tough war.”
“It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role,” said the Czech ambassador to the European Union, Milena Vicenova.
When she succeeded in describing the various EU bodies and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible way that a large number of lecturers at Charles University's Faculty of Law might envy her, she showed how much she takes her motto "understandably and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
“From the beginning, the criticism resounded that he’s dull, that he’s a leatherback, that he can’t fulfill any mission and I have to say that he has taken everyone’s breath away because he plays his part perfectly.”
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of a response to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "Which phone number should I call?", thus as an important step towards the unity and greater readability of the Union's policy vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our syrecky (cooked pasta cheese that smells very strong)
Ms Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs have resolved the emerging financial crisis, the gas crisis or organised a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "activity has been in full swing" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved even now.
The new seven-year budget of the Union, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation, must also be approved.
As it seems that the budget will be thin and with a view to savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the framework of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a comprehensible Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted pickles, bananas differently large or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky ".
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
In addition, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
According to her, the fault is due to several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a cover letter and a low level of support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me: 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?' and he is not at all happy."
According to Ms Vicenova, in the near future, the Member States are waiting for tough new rules on fiscal policy.
It is the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
“We have countries in the euro zone and others outside the zone.”
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation."
In the first place, it was said that countries that want to cooperate with each other and those that do not want to remain in their corners.
"There will be a lot of institutes of this type and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," she said.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all issues having an impact on the EU should be debated among all EU members and not only the members of the Eurozone.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the term that most closely expresses the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long term".
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was laid by the firm’s first chief, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left behind the slogan that many global problems can be solved as long as people are willing to think.
Its slogan "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the basis of Watson's care company culture.
For us, IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years because it always remained true to its core values and yet was not afraid to change everyone else around it.
This has enabled us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more"delayed for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began taking care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacations, insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and dealers.
In the same way IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was initially great at discovering talent – as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus had a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman – Virginia Rometty – who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has been doing so-called jamy, online brainstorming from which have come a lot of future strategies and innovations.
No wonder he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a secure position in the business field.
“From the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor of economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a tech firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology,” said Geogre Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Big Blue", as it is familiarly called in the United States due to its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products up to nanotechnology.
It holds numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are for example the ATM, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM found itself this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
It is not all innovations and manufactures that have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example did not succeed in the bet on a clean operating system OS/2, the online Prodigy service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on moving forward you can’t emotionally stay hooked on the past,” notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For that IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it leaves.
Unlike, for example, Microsoft’s competitor, which stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However still in 1990 it was with more than the participation motie the strongest hardware representative.
Starting in the year 2000 IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during that period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM is trading according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
Does it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without worrying?
The IBM share price has grown from 2008 in rocket by 120 percent, the firm's net profit continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
For this reason, we can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
History of IBM: From slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
The IBM company (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it originally had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the year 80 of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as the old "pointers", the clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then cast a shadow over the firm's founder - it is on Watson's ideas that the company's identity and culture have so far been based.
Watson ran the firm until 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson's tenure, revenue increased to $9 million and the firm began to expand to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of management it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos – to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time under the name IBM 5150 came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began dealing with consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been successful at IBM for the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
In the field of commerce, IBM recently developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps salespeople manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the Brno strategic outsourcing center.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team responsible for speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) becomes bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for the future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova asylum in her home in the summer, she did not suspect that her couple would not hold out.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not push back the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
Eventually Darina resigned herself, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova said, pointing out that she has detached herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I will stay with Iveta and will not change.”
"My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
“With Darina we talk completely normal but we don’t sleep together,” Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop her.
“We don’t sleep together and I’m not interested in where she’s going, with whom and if she has an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all, both of them, are able to pull them "out of their sleeve".
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines female vices that manage to pump blood from the veins of men.
The purchases
Does your half make any remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least one piece of clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy and by packages at the time of sales?
In your case we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which would resist the shop window of clothing stores, to look for yourself nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become for men a real hell.
Just remember how many times you have told your spouse that he is waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I need to lose at least 5 kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me?"
Do these phrases not remind you of something?
Oh, yeah?
So you're one of those women who's obsessed with how they look.
This is not the issue that you should stop taking care of yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about their appearance.
The stronger sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become poisonous.
The odor and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Washing windows, vacuuming, cleaning floors, dusting, stripping the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have soiled the sink, clogged the living room window, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you are just suffering from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can, however, spoil your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put this worn-out sweater in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this digging work on your partner several times a day, you’re really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much digging work.
Defamation, Persiflage
Defamation, stalking but also insults against someone are also the property of some women.
Women are particularly attracted to relationships and are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets out a harmless little persiflation here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, stalk, even despise others and are especially dangerous for their entourage - especially at work in a women's collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped with Philadelphia victory
Hockey forward Jagr twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is once again leading the productive Czech players for the contest.
From the point of view of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told reporters from overseas that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes that feeling falls on you," explained Jagr after his action Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the paddle and introduced him to goalkeeper Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said of his center.
“I never thought I’d play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him.”
"I'm really happy about that."
“I want to play on him.”
“All these years in the NHL the other players on the team have been trying to play me, now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a one-goal difference.
Matt Read did not rule out further complications that ended in a two-on-one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the pallet, I got some speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
“I tried to hit him and I did it,” he describes the final goal of the match from Voracek’s point of view.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal Czech defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he came out in the second third due to an upper body injury.
The Candians did not stand up to an experienced defender their two-butset lead they lost after a 2:3 penalty shot.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that mostly annoyed the local coach rather than lost fists as they played the match only with 5 defenders.
"It's bad."
“We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young people.
“But there’s nothing to do, that’s how it is,” says Jacques Martin.
“Replacement over replacement wasn’t enough and we couldn’t resist.”
“We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our zone.”
For that we had limits," added one of the P.K. Subban defenders.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the thirtieth attack of Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the Jets' uax goals, which stopped a series of 5 lost games.
How Travel Prices Have Changed Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays to East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a tilt towards the west and trips to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that citizens of the socialist bloc (also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually even within the framework of socialist countries.
In the event that the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually for example to Poland or the Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation otherwise the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but you had to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency deal that was the condition for traveling to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of foreign exchange (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were consequently many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989, Czech travel has undergone a major revolution.
Although until 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their peak, last year Czechs spent 4 million days abroad in countries around the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in the western neighbouring countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel for a long time by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a trip from Czech was at that time to take with you your own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech krona which allowed our tourists finally after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average salary increased which caused around 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have started since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter routes that through contracts have tremendously reduced costs compared to what there was before.
In the late 1990s the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world except the US which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic was prepared.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to the distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
Over 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully rank in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time yet in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad including ancillary charges. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President but this risks ending in a situation without a solution "a pat"
Almost 5 months ago, Czech football was without a president and there is a risk that Ivan Hasek's successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly that is scheduled to take place Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement as to what voting rules should be followed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did football go back to divergences between the Association's chambers that could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16 when it was necessary to choose a new president.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation was blocked and there was not even a question of how to elect.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, statutory representatives or even officials with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the help also of the Bureau for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There are still differences about the rules for the election.
It is all too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also contributed nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the focal point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The point of contention is either to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, the candidate who received the most votes in percentage in the chamber for which he is a candidate wins in the third round.
Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the vote percentages.
"Only then would it lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian party and according to which it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the settlement of the elections established according to the statutes benefits Pelta the most among all the candidates.
"I want to vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet any wild ideas imagined by a representative as in past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen's owner who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself above all against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
“The possible qualifying today in the European Championship should calm everyone down.”
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there is more momentum for cooperation," adds the Jablonec officer who among the three has the greatest experience in football management both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
“I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense.”
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This may once again cause a blockage in the General Assembly."
“I still hope healthy reason wins,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell if the entire direction of football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight, in which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorice, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee to the retaliatory field.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to welcome the torn parties into the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union that must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the fight for the position of President because he does not see any correct candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asks for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigning for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not run for election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from gaining the head of the AFRT, which would a priori be given favorite for this election.
Paclik also points out that in the event that he wins the elections he will hold this position of President only until 2013 year planned for a General Assembly.
He would see in the role an experienced and high-level manager who is not connected with the world of football.
“I talked to people who would have the profile,” he said.
“For me it was terrible when some told me they didn’t want to be identified with Czech football at the moment.”
“I would like to change that image,” he added.
What, it is said, particularly troubles Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of controversial fame who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the delegates' vote the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold this position of President.
“If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football.”
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, this would be even less favorable to football," Paclik said.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago during a wiretap in an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta got away with no pain.
“I don’t know what prestige Pelta would bring to football.”
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes president, I sell the club of Plzen".
In the event that Paclik triumphs in Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same.
“He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with.”
“He has great capabilities.”
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able."
"I don't put my nose into what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he voted for the cancellation of the Referees' Commission with Ludek Mazela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private companies and that he also leads since last year the club of Plzen that celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it.”
“I would curb the influence of some interested groups that for example tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste,” added Paclik, who does not seek his antipathy for Sparta’s leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power with high-level policies would make it possible to obtain more money for sport from gaming tax.
"This is one of the key issues that the new president should be addressing."
“If it’s about the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT President should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my actions from the Plzen club to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta promised new statutes for AFRT that should end pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to quarrels about the settlement for the elections.
The Jablonec official is before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that today's success of the football representation should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which did not take place, promised to devote himself precisely to national representation and to obtaining financial means if he is elected.
He decided to run at the last moment just before the General Assembly passed and this delay of two months could well allow him to defend his vision of football management and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday.”
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is above all linked with the club of Jablonec, has worked for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election lies a euphoria that reigned in the days of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly statutes were approved that were not perfect as everyone noticed."
“If there weren’t all these different interpretations, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took the delegates' full attention.
“If I become president, I take it as my personal mission and am ready to take full responsibility in case it doesn’t work.”
“It’s a principle without which we can’t exist,” Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes his legal background and that he is well aware that his adversary-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He also has not attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He has been playing football for a year and has already had some successes."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent but remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to national representation.
It should be a football vitrine.
"And I would also try to finish all the business that starts with the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all the football," the 46th candidate told Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring any change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov where there has been understandable nervousness since there was no leadership.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“If there is a single point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round, we will be able to overcome it.”
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when a new leader is at the head of it," Pelta said optimistically two days before the day that is likely to determine her career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday it would not please many people, it seems.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he is elected, we will begin to work hard.
He wants systemic changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I want to take care of football as a whole.
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high-performance youth football."
“But I’m not saying I’m going to do all this alone,” Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members takes care of a certain area."
“And I will distribute difficult missions for football to take a big step forward.”
“Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others,” he added.
He stated, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, you know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubts on each of my actions," he said.
“A lot of people have told me that I shouldn’t give up because they would give up too.”
“It’s a confidence I can’t betray,” he says.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“For the past two years there has been a lot of work done and I don’t want to let it go.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
“Behind him are people who would play football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen.”
“I can be blamed for a number of things, but I’m sure I can’t bear one.”
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he again confirms that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
“And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do my utmost for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian whose winners would end up in the first division."
“There would be no situation like at the moment with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I am constantly feeling the support of the Czech House that elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," Rajchl said, adding that his future successes include saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, contract negotiations with televisions and on the gaming law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footballer would lose his credibility", he thinks the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
“No one can doubt that Plzen has done a great job this year.”
"If elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any notable change among the people in the Commissions."
“He wouldn’t want to spoil his successes,” said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
UFO-optical paddling pools, Budapest’s magnificent swimming pools: Whoever travels across Europe can experience its blue miracle – and after going around the city or taking a long walk – can let his tired legs rest in soda baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the last 18 months, there is one item that should not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor swimming pool pleased her, she immediately noted in her notebook all the interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden". The municipal indoor swimming pools of Münich, the historic bathing palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia, respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fervent bath culture.
Meder explains that she doesn’t have much interest in the sport but he feels drawn to the water in a totally different way.
It’s annoying that swimmers should just gaze at blue tiles and adjust to the stench of bleach while joggers breathe the fragrant scent of spruce forests or listen to the humming of the park’s cheerful birds.
"I once wondered why swimming pools should actually always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dip in a pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real treat for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to take a leap into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Next to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing waters in a natural cavern in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths whose pools are filled with alkali-containing water and (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Term<0xC3><0xA1>lfürdö in J<0xC3><0xA1>n
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zurich bath you can see the whole city, you can admire the snow-capped Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton: The Turkish bath has a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountains rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of bleach does not emanate from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulfur, from the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool – a special spa experience.
During her search for the beautiful pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor and outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded lot.
The bath designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
Taking a look through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the blossoming of weeds between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: The Bad Wildbad Thermal Spa Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that come out since its design in 1844 but also a Moorish room in Alhambra style that was added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of swimming pool expert Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally from Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a great return to merging such different building styles into such a formidable unit,” says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural Speculation
German bank examines commodity speculation in detail
by Christian Teevs
Is the German bank giving up its commodity speculation?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study builds on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that stock market speculation on global commodities pushes prices up and that banks share a complicity with global famine.
The consumer protection campaign aligns itself against the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Commodity speculation was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts meanwhile share the opinion that bettors have detached themselves from offers and demands – and profit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently from American competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "no case is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank on the line."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report accusations.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode hailed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how today's banks are harming the public interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly obligated today.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter to Mr. Ackermann whether it’s about hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank’s reputation is at stake.”
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group’s CEO wants to present a perfect image, a few months before he leaves office.
Deutsche Bank said Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned in the Board of Directors.
Ll could improve its brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculation.
And about potential losses, he doesn't have much to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would terminate investments in commodities.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organization.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires on November 7 and 8, with 1001 people.
Just 11 percent have found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many customers of the bank would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank participates in such operations: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their entourage, 49 percent replied that they would think about the termination of their account to change banks.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruins.
Now it is open again and acts as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, glass sheds, bright and bold looks and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the world exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its lightweight, suspended steel and glass construction.
Construction is considered to this day as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian World Exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at Vienna South Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However it was as long used, until contemporary art received a new edifice in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly deteriorating.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "Maison du 21<0xC3><0xA8>me si<0xC3><0xA8>cle" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvéd<0xC3><0xA8>re museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck from any point of view.
The new start was carried out by Agn<0xC3><0xA8>s Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as an artistic figure skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she particularly carried out the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba, whose foundation bears the same name, have been exhibited there, a café and a bookshop are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict oversight, small budget
Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter for the production.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded Joseph Olbracht’s secession and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was “an extremely important place” where he had seen “virtually every weekend” exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and its change of use.
In the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was "a chasm of energy," Krischanitz says.
The window profiles of the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades were changed, fiberglass-reinforced insulating glass was laid and the roof replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridge beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a dimmed light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in a rust-proof shade of red-brown.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the authorities responsible for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also appeal to the office of protection monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, “which came from Brussels,” Krischanitz said recently, a typical story of “Drop-in-the-City.”
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken good conscience".
But in this case the 21st century House is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance shot of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands the newly planned "central station district", with offices and apartments.
And perhaps another stroke of luck will happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city in order to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a million-dollar winter crisis package.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more in this regard this year.
The newspaper "Bild"-Zeitung previously reported, citing a crisis plan internal to the group, that investments totalling about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and of the rail network also in the case of extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, the number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway facilities and docks is expected to double to 16,000 people.
The objective is to clear the quays of snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago Station Chief Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because, among other things, it lacks reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
For many years, many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been busy for years, since it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more often at the workshop, after an axle breakage took place on an ICE in Cologne Central Station.
The German bank Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the US: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this giant of the sector catches up in the USA: the Frankfurt institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Markets Regulator is bringing a series of accusations against the big banks that they are inciting co-operative banks to make false promises about buying financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost enormously in value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down.
"We are satisfied that we were able to find a solution to this issue without the parties initiating a court proceeding," a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman in New York said.
In comparison, the Bank did not admit any fault.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks aside and in the summer he sued the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As far as the issue of mortgage documents is concerned, this is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
The credit unions are at the bottom of it.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years old, at the moment there is a stormy wind blowing on the US banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have made numerous recourses to seek redress or to sanction defaults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, the two U.S. state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for taking advantage of each other in in-kind mortgage deals worth about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, a number of transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities demand that Frankfurter respond to “substantial losses” but without citing a precise sum.
Deutsche Bank had dismissed the claims as unjustified and said it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett raises 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, is investing colossal sums in IBM’s IT business.
Since March, it has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not to invest in IT companies, given that the long-term evolution of companies only show bad prognosis.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his view on investment in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offers IT services and systems for other companies' IT sectors.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight’s attack on the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT business grants itself the right to now be called "Mr. IBM".
Buffett revealed today to the economic issue CNBC, that since March he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a 5.5 percent share.
Buffett said IBM has never known about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services as an operation of accounting centres.
The more than 100-year-old IT pioneer offers both software and consulting as well as high-performance enterprise calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands the business of.
On the contrary, Buffett is attacking rail freight, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a number of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and established it as one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM shares rose by one percent on the stock exchange.
“Big Blue,” also known as IBM, has a total market value of more than $220 billion and is among the world’s most valuable technology companies with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn’t want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable.
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist background.
Following this news, Turkey and the Turkish-German population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks, the specter that was long thought dead has reappeared: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany has never been mentioned.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology", "This was the title of the Turkish daily Haberturk's Internet publication.
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, however, that one of the authors was a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted in a reasoned way: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports from some Turkish media have the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Also, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of unambiguous conditions.
“It begins to puer,” is the title of Ahmet Külahci’s chronicle.
He pointed out that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it has not already come to the mind of the German authorities much earlier to do research in certain suspicious far-right circles, the authors wonder.
More than one is prepared at least for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be sluggish, there will be nothing left for migrants other than self-defense and armament."
“It will be the best self-defense.”
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," Selen wrote.
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the bombings of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which distrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks that the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish head of state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was counting at the time in his speech, how many taxes were produced by the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax burdens.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the distrust of many German-Turks has been towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and reassess far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Lake Zurich Scandal Bank
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost gone bankrupt in the financial crisis and is patinating in the meantime from one crisis to the next.
It is a German who must lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; we learned in July, that he would occupy in 2013 a position almost as spectacular: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the big Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, hailed; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently achieved solidity and passed on kind remarks on future colleagues.
"The UBS has made it through the Turnaround."
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
And yet, as of September, it was clear that everything would change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the bank’s security systems and burned about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the Board of Directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a banker well known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the UBS board of directors has since been seen as suffering - and everyone is asking: When does Axel Weber finally come back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank as of February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank said Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is becoming difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
All of a sudden he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, UBS is on one side huge - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, it has been skating for years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, it had combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich recounts: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, we ask ourselves: how could I have simply been so wrong?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it became apparent that for the first time something was not going around at UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, who was previously considered a top intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later, we figured out why he left.
The division of the bank had torched with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
To do this, it has indeed found investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was ignored, to the point that its name was never even learned.
But this was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank was to announce again losses amounting to billions, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS was in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to host such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 amounted to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
“We weren’t able to save the UBS again,” says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster followed the second.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who had cheated the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS more or less published that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the Head of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of client money.
In just a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to poor speculation and asset management due to aid for tax evasion.
And, as there was some calm, and as we thought, that UBS would get away with it, it followed this unfortunate story of title dealers: a single title dealer torches 1.7 billion euros, before the bank noticed that something was not going around.
And we publish: with risk management in investment banking it still does not seem to work.
“With the Adoboli case, we found that risk management has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
So the chief financial officer of a major German bank is certain: "The problem with UBS is that it has no control over risk."
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long since taken up their function, that of becoming guardians of the great fortune of the world: no too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich is still going hand in hand with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank – it is only a bit larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's can be found here among the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss bankers have resided here for centuries: from the national bank to the Credit Suisse Palace to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day sidelined the market – or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he also does business with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too big, he finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would have also spread.
The Swiss have nothing to say.
"And even so, they have long since adapted to the mores of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed UBS, it made high profits and then debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," wrote author Lukas Hässig in his book The UBS Crash.
With up to 68 billion francs or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks concluded a huge group together.
A bank was created, which was already too big for small Switzerland - and has been steadily growing.
What helped was that the two different predecessor banks of UBS completed: a rich but lethargic bank with asset management in Zurich as its strong point and a poorer but already more strongly internationalised one.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who understands himself very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli to the end.
And wuffi would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remember the meetings of the leaders at which the head of the Wuffli group always spoke the same slogan: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of currencies and securities transactions, it played a very important role.
The corporate advisors, who were responsible for it, however, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost it its life.
Desperate for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has morphed into a massive machine that packed and passed valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages — but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking to go down.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when stopping the attempts turned out to be more difficult than previously thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and are so far bankrupt.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: stop investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t want to go that far.
But the investment bank must vigorously atrophy, as far as this is clear so far.
Next Thursday, bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank split with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has made his mark: he must carry out the business of UBS on a sustainable basis, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress of the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He said publicly until now only that he was going to find an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe over the weekend has discouraged U.S. investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
Industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in its germ.
General relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I had only half filled last week, not half empty - but now the problems are once again pressing in the foreground, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The default values of the Dow-Jones-Index noted at market close a loss of approximately 0.6% to 12,078 points.

Industry in the 17 euro area countries significantly reduced production and adjusted at the end of the recovery.
As announced by the Eurostat statistics office, companies produced in September, 2% less than in the previous month.
U.S. investors have expressed themselves in a skeptical way: “We are not an island, on the other hand dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only confirmed this caution: “It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis,” he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was from his point of view too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle to the winds and entered the American technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the price of the shares of this traditional group, and allowed him to score almost more than 1%, against the trend of commercial management.
The paper finished almost unchanged at $187.35.

Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, friezes are considered a "bird problem" but experts say these very intelligent animals have not been driven out of cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplying because of the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to chase freus from cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
Protectors of nature based the problems of cities also on the exodus of particularly protected freus: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional living spaces.
Hunting, planting and felling typical hatchery trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity because of the slaughter of crows in the region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal rods.
"Normal eviction, eviction, is useless," Werner Klöver, the city and landscape planner in Leer, said.
Destroying nests using water under pressure or cutting down trees often has unintended consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals are moving away, large colonies are dividing and they are dispersing to other places.”
Eviction is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of evicting animals to aversive conditioning and eye-catching offers, to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospected "info boards instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-path-educational baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing the lives of these very intelligent freus.
In the meantime, this project has been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of noise caused by birds: "This is a great deal of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Freus not only use instruments of work to arrive at a feast but they themselves manufacture their tools as instruments of work.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge recently tested four friezes of how intelligent birds are.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they firmly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning crows then had to solve a more stuffy problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their loot with their beak.
However, the researchers had made pieces of wire available to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they caught the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four friezes are even successful from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a coup by the Bosniaks and the Turks remained unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will take part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the 2012 European Championship playoffs in Poland and knocked Ukraine out.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal went wrong against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0:0 of the match, their fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the play-off return match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also hotter in the 0:0 draw between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland taking a 1:1 (1:0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other draws for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga player Wolfsburg, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a hand-played 11-metre penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Est<0xC3><0xA1>dio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick of 30 meters in advance in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his shooting skills from a distance and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship of Manchester City initiated a header ball directed to the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek shot a goal for the Czech
Finally referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other side, Stark conceded a controversial 11-meter hand-played penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 vice-champion of Europe managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), was also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossbar had to come to the rescue of the world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs already shot down, once again, the forward of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the Zagreb football miracle during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the 2002 EM third bench, the Croats were able to look forward to their fourth round in the European Championship final.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream departure.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the post, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd Minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team to coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken over with a 4:0 success the first stage for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for the visitors.
Ireland pushed to the top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence was able to prevent a possible goal from the -first goaltender.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and squeezed the ball onto the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” CEO Bill McDermott announced to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this fast-growing country.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.
SAP expects to increase turnover to €20 billion in 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfer recorded revenues of nearly 12.5 billion euros.
Currently the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked as well.
SAP has been active in China for over 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our business ...,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information.”
Personal mass slaughtering
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. Titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War", it begins with a long list of characters that holds your heart.
A tip to start with: carefully tear this page apart and make it your bookmark.
In this novel by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book which he accurately describes as "a work of anti-history."
It has some well-known names, important treatises or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors or discussions on strategies and materials.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like." It includes "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Grief" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, paramedics and salesmen.
Some will become heroes.
Others will be prisoners of war, some will lose limbs, go mad, or lose their lives.
Their lives are shaking here like the candles of a church: while some are going out, new ones are being lit.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
He denies the idea that World War I can only be summed up in the terrible trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skilfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When gunshots sound in the distance, and you’re a housewife, do you stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts has been heightened by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and Grief" follows such individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nanny in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor from the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most are dealing with deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on alternative food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
He states that "837 authorized substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 alternative coffees."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive for savagery and declares about war: "You feel that after all, it is what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no beard.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is very likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
“When one is resigned to sacrifice, one hopes to have an audience,” he writes.
This is, unfortunately, rather comparable to "a convicted man strangled in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“Conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who performs his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as there are heroism.
Peter Englund talks about the soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
“We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into lifelong blindness."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures how the war has “triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are waging war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West", rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have ever read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he came out of his book, grabbed that page with the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first misstep, a meticulously planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the outset that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges to the Police Department.
There could be no rehearsals of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which went against the department's regulations and spawned a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti park from its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the course of the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall, in view of the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better anti-riot training — anti-terror measures that consist of rapidly moving large numbers of police officers — to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move around the park arrived "at the last minute", said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
“The few police officers I know who were called did not know that they would go to Zuccotti Park,” the person said on condition of anonymity.
"The only ones who know they'd go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city was able to learn a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighborhood – dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people came and went to the park during the day, in the manner of migrants, so one hour in the morning was a propitious time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages resounding from the loudspeakers appeared to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were hit before 1:45 a.m., police said, giving occupants time to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were needed.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said the move was taken solely for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly restrained by the officers.
Browne said the TV camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the crowded business of protesters, including luggage, plastic turf and bags of sheets filled with clothes, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged, and the images were posted on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the Police have moved to methodically stop.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the padlocks.
No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
According to police, the cleanup operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them were for "public order disorder and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the highest-ranking officer to be found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, though present, "did not lead operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of intervention.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as Pine Street, to the south.
Police have been seen expanding the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, were reportedly even seen pushing people away.
About 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
At about 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, while others were spotted breaking the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood emerged flying from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The union of school helpers sues the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school helpers who lost their jobs last month, plans to file a lawsuit against the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The lawsuits are probably the union's ultimate weapon, the 37th District Council, in an attempt to get the layoffs overturned.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees, among the lowest paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7, when union leaders compared these layoffs to political revenge for not allowing the city access to a health care fund run by groups of workers, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that redundancies were part of the budget that was closed in June.
One member of the Council retaliated, mentioning that the dismissals of school aides were in no way specified in the budget.
37th District Council officers said they would fill out a notice of claim, notifying the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits to the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's Department of Education will be the respondent. The plaintiffs will be represented by eight redundant workers, all of them black or of Latin American origin, like most aides who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would bet on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 aides have lost their jobs in Brownsville's 23rd District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five aides out of eight employees at Harlem’s 36 Public School, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the lawsuit states that “It’s not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget shortfall.”
The budget of the public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each underprivileged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The memo used the term "overtime" to describe the action, although "overtime" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parent coordinators were dismissed," and "not just because of overtaking."
Mission Completed: Congress Finds Agreement on Libya Issue
It would eventually appear that the Republicans and Democrats had reached an agreement at the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democrat-Mass.), with Senators John McCain (Republican-Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent-Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and U.S. troops for their "courage."
“This resolution is about honoring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not approving the U.S. military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution to allow the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure to cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
So the U.S. mission remained in a form of legislative purgatory — Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The indecision of Congress has been overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution “congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as it did last June?
Senator and Chair of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) objected to the latest version.
His spokesman said Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
On Capitol Hill, the House is due to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly every Republican in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled in Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and Senate - and others are slight variations from a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but they give their supporters - especially new Republicans who want to gild their resumes - the chance to brag about being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August called for the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment banning desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose it.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slowed compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
'Massacreed but not beaten' Gabrielle Giffords says in first TV interview since shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot at her in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on a television show on Monday night, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover rather than return to Congress.
When she appeared on ABC's "20/20" television show alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show addressed his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first televised interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — calling her recovery “difficult.”
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, responded "pretty well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of “20/20,” aired the day before the release of the couple’s new book titled “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, shaved head and a large scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair as doctors teach her how to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"? ".
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours a day with doctors, said she does not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information about the six people killed in the incident for the first time.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is held in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
“There have been a lot of deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
When she recovered, Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, “I was beaten.”
"So I'd say, 'Gabby, you haven't been beaten,'" Kelly said.
You've just been slaughtered.
And you're going to get out of it, recover, and come back stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for New York City’s homeless veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie-dress stood at his feet to cheer him.
“The military, men and women, are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A senior military official present at the gala, who was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Armed Forces, saw the role of troops in a different way.
“They were presented as a kind of orphan,” the military high-ranking official wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have been established between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some soldiers.
The audience is increasingly acting as if they are sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits."
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unthankful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops of the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about mercy take place in complete secrecy among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect as they faced insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who were putting him through the interviews were subtly asking if he would be able to keep up under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after he returned from combat.
"When you approach the subject of service, you are confronted with negative impressions," Colonel Cancian recalls as he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely praised by a country so unfamiliar with the military and seeing little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as we did in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people largely focus on the depth of a soldier’s suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of periods of service endured, the number of friends lost, or the extent of injuries.
Army Faces Growing Pressure to Strive Against Rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the military for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If so, hundreds of plaintiffs will prepare for the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008, when she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It was a wake-up call,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I should have followed my intuition.”
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman’s room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still on duty and some not, will look forward to the court decision at a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether a trial against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of failing to stop the spread of rape within the army, thereby violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number amounted to 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the military has not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke claims to be attacking the galloping military, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
The lawyer also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future prosecutions.
Her strategy: instead of bringing all the plaintiffs together in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will bring several lawsuits, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
“The alleged wrongdoing is inherent in the military service of the complainants,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to war, this distinction is inscribed only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, including in reaching out to local women.
As a result, 150 female soldiers lost their lives in these two wars – two-thirds in combat.
It's time for the army to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three more trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for supposedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnoses of “personality disorders” attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave — a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women’s Action Network, a rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to handle claims for benefits for people who claim to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Defense Department’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that year.
The report published in March also looks at the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the military were prosecuted - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Susan Burke's case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell various police officers, doctors and commanders in detail about her rape 11 times.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sits before a judge at a trial during which she is questioned about her sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier in the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality to the perpetrator, who ended up being acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was handed down,” Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after court."
"I was put in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commander, 'It wasn't his trial but mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
"Will the Lyman case and the other plaintiffs move forward or not, it's a long history," said John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction stands between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence posed by responsibility.
“The odds are heavy against them ... but it’s important that they try,” he adds.
These things only change when the good guys have the will to fight.
If the trial doesn’t turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
“We will continue to fight the military on this issue until there is reform,” she said.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who shared his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being caught in a murderous insanity in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with a few of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by DEMOS’ think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is so full of personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific accuracy — the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions asked were about their own level of education, attitudes to violence and optimism about their future.
By getting in touch with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.”
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new must-have tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, through "Likes", publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the “data supernova” generates a search explosion, increasing the number of search jobs whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to conduct investigations into people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in,” says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their drunken exploits were vastly more likely to be alcoholic than discrete students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle.
“We know how to identify children who are at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized.”
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied statistics regarding the love situation and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 midterm elections and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its treasure trove of data available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is something else online.
“I don’t think a lot of users have ever thought about whether a researcher could study their profile,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,” Selwyn said.
That's why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and a pen are still the best tools one can use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not in front of a computer."
"Cold and Inhuman" by Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance at the Oslo trial.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars," he told a courtroom filled with 500 people.
“As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it because you hold your mandate as an organization supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, speak to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Justice Nesheim also asked police to keep Breivik in detention for an additional twelve weeks, barred him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Approximately 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhumane," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television channel NRK.
“I wasn’t comfortable, but I personally made a little progress after seeing and hearing the suspect.”
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial and looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and exited the courtroom.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not insane. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks therefore appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the entire nation.
“I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but it’s not,” said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview at the Movies This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in a recent interview with Steve Jobs, which will be released this week in the first part of a film in major markets, is how much that creative mind had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease leaving them to think that a great idea does 90% of the work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traces the birth of the computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs' death that a full video was found in the director's garage.
The video is the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will air in theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurfaces, when he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbows to make him accelerate and move on to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect in Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision on the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read Steve Jobs’ posthumous career assessments, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then puts them into practice.
Here’s a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences from Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
“Throughout all these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why are you doing things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" assessed at nose-sight, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated plant that ensured accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone networks and phone for free over long distances.
The device has been the subject of many writings before, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We would wrap the ball in different things a half-dozen times and you would scream in the pay phone and it would happen to you a minute later on the pay phone next door,” Jobs said.
“We were young, and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn't know much about each other, but we did invent a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have devised: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go crazy laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett’s departure):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company’s research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first ever designed desktop computer.”
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube. I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim.
Early in his career, as he moved in to sell a few printed circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big arguments... I was yelling at and pretending it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and it proved incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are running out of breath:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial executives would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Suppose you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then what?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are those types of people] who end up leading companies and product-savvy staff are put away from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product in relation to a bad product - the manual labor required.
This is what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They wrested defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge amount of manual labor separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to be made... Some things you can’t do, electrons can do it, glass, robots, factories can do it, too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made out of personal taste. It's about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring those things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
That's part of what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who were working on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who just turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health law opponents as court meets
On the day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to discuss the issue of political discord, whether opposition to President Obama’s health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases involved a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, as a monumental 5:30 a.m. argument is expected next March, and the result will likely be likely to further the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming by the time the court's decision is made.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue against the rejection of the law will presumably be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Solicitor General during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another proponent was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health law.
Starring guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would no doubt argue with the Code of Canon 4C, which states: “A judge may attend fundraising by law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be an intervener, guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event.”
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court abides by the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“The judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court.”
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dismantles any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a conservative activist of high profile.
Moreover, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a solicitor general for the Obama administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought at the court of first instance level.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had been too invested in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record order of $18 billion for airliners
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, two-aisle airliners, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order contemplating 50 of its products.
It is, however, quite a case when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 planes reaches the record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Equally incredible is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing reported on the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisles.
It was Emirates airline based in Dubai that placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more planes, bringing the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said on Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and passenger conveniences.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than one billion dollars.
“This is clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst.
"These customers in particular are of immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So they have not only the means to pay for these planes, but an increase in the price of fuel - usually harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them since the country would make money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point as these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil rises, Dihora said.
“They have natural risk coverage,” he said.
Emirates’ order strengthens Boeing’s predominance in the large-capacity aircraft market and helps curb competitor Airbus’ attempted encroachment with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the aeronautical show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the largest version of the A350, which directly rivals the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is postponing its debut to increase momentum following customers’ demand to increase its load capacity and range.
Boeing’s shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Demonstrably Beaten in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n Elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the race to the governorship.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her bid to become governor of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n in violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race to the post of governor of this western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon told radio during an interview Monday after the elections.
“They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... They seized the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote” for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until losing the presidency in 2000.
But he is organizing his return, and a victory in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out only a few from Calderon, who led the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother’s Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a leftist candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the office of governor, came in third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any links to drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet the violence persisted.
A week before the election a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD urges Asia to help the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would impede the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the director general of the Manila-based BASD, said the world’s two fastest-growing economic powers must “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) against looking at Europe’s difficulties with an “indifferent eye” and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe’s leaders and resources would “avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.”
“We are all in this crisis together.”
“Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point but it is not safe."
“So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them.”
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan has skyrocketed dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The booming sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked fears that the global economy will go into recession, and has prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Nag predicted that the IMF would channel any Asian aid, but he also said that bilateral assistance — such as buying bonds from the U.S. financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund — offered greater negotiating power to Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s Minister of Trade and Industry, said that “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a dwindling inflow of foreign capital.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and uneasy,” he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the wealthy Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get Europe to accept aid for the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.
“One day they will find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and going on vacation in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it,” he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many high-paying Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the euro zone crisis was likely to cause "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD’s forecast of economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now faces “risks of loss” due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop relief plans" to protect themselves from economic upheaval and large capital outflows.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defense Reductions
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that impending automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and triggered a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields to civilian rallies.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more of cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that Congress’ failure to reach a budget agreement resulting in so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
“Such a significant reduction, applied indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or building – and seriously undermine other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote.
“We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparedness.”
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
“Although wartime financing of foreign contingency accounts is not directly affected by the seizure, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in core budgets,” Panetta warned.
“Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war.”
“The staff managing wages would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of an abduction on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.”
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as Panetta's letter was released.
“It’s not a consequence we can live with, and it’s certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself has made it to the top position in the Pentagon accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he faced difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don’t have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission,” Panetta said.
“It’s a depressed force, unprepared and unable to face potential opponents.”
"De facto, she's calling for aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could “generate significant operational risks: delay in responding to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the cutting edge, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Stopping the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is a critical step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Spot a Lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught in an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has gone astray by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to the coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of those who have lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton sparked by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the test answers to students in order to make themselves visible on their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie to each other three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to exclaim: "I've got you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research on such projects, including in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been demystified.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don’t stutter, blush, or always get agitated.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified lie detector can uncover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific findings in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge about deception, and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are skilled at reading others, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more lies “centered on them” while women tell more lies “centered on others” – usually to protect someone’s feelings – that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called “establishing benchmark data.”
This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, the vocal quality.
You need to know if someone is normally shaking their feet all the time so as not to make unfair accusations when you see them shaking their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues to verbal and nonverbal deceptive behavior.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change posture significantly or present a "post-interview" relief - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions are passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
Famous Scott Peterson skidded back to the past while claiming his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use distant language: "I have not had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wooden tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing the skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan to be diverted after U.S. late approval threat
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - angering unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department’s announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, vast underground water sources.
"It's a real path forward," Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The State Department's new environmental review would likely have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's election, although officials deny the policy's involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed his support for it.
The 2,735-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do this, it would have to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pushing for legislation to force the removal of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department’s inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle launched into a riot of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited out of fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened the 18-month-old Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve Monk to such an extent that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, and Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk descended into the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and laid down her daughter for a while.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and went to get her," she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
“She told me in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
“I said, ‘What you say or think I’m not interested in.’
She became enraged and started using jurors - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother - who still held Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve in her arms - and had to be held back by her entourage who drove her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she began to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return our calls for comment.
The lawsuit claims unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a charity for children.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child.”
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez's management, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment fell and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing trillions of losses for the agricultural sector, have limited the opportunities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic decrease of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost assignments issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in the first thousand people unemployment rate in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography 9 percent the unemployment rate of the State during the first three quarters of the year there was an accelerated increase, because while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloa were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent for the Population 5 percent, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly depending on the actions carried out by public policy.
“What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in an illicit way it is not easy for them to work to earn them, to invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Detained migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
“The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been limited, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because when they enter they already have a lot of difficulty in finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the sinaloen labour market worsens considering the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the state's lag is low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which stands at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Apart from the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy of January to June the FDI of the State reached 630 thousand 697, representing a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 recorded in the same period.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government has a total investment of 17.280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government requested in July at the public congress the approval of a loan of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November no profit was observed.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employers’ sector, the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés’ government demonstrates a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year was really very poor, we have to work intensely to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, it was necessary to align the effort of all and above all the already synchronized good progress of this new government team, hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
Slow economic growth
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said events like the frosts at the beginning of the year have held the state’s economy back and curtailed its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, among which the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not rotate fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close well below the expectations that we had," he says.
Redefining the Vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state towards productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that we detonate the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he says.
A lot to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that a lot of work has been done and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to be done," he said.
Convicted of 8 kilos of marihuana
A person living in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General’s Office has informed that the small trafficker convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant of possession of marihuana for sale.
In accordance with AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was driving in a white pick-up truck, carrying a black bag in the trunk of the vehicle and a small backpack in the co-pilot’s place where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items were made available to the Second District Judge and the convict is still in the Center for the Enforcement of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts to contributions to works
Works of a social nature contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescate de Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 para migrantes risk not being finished where to register serious delays due to lack of economic resources, reported Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk because the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have not given us anything, even if since July they had to give us a part," he says, "and we, in order not to register delays, we have started the works and we have advanced a lot, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to be able to access these programs, had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the managements so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost $12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us anything.”
The Court validates the "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree that details the actions to be taken to realize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft award, prepared by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, due to the fact that the regulation of radio and television is an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
In favor of the project only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions provided for by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of ministers also resolved to dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the minister-president said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also consider that if he did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has as constitutional mandate the direction of the State.
Substitution of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this translates into better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalization, which implies a decision in the public interest that does not only have a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he underlined, "require the operation of an entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded in some way the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislature, he assured.
Analysis of the possibility of a count "vote by vote" in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
According to data highlighted by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total 6,74 minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 minutes total.
In this sense, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards to the federal reform in electoral matters.
It will be remembered that Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not homologate either his Political Constitution or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Law, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline for this electoral process to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the Journal of the Electoral Law.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the vote of the state representative for constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because he does not have the right to "sanctify or challenge them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to realize the partial and total counts of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no ballot record and counting in the file of the ballot box is not found in the president of the latter; or there are errors or obvious alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all the ballot boxes of the election can be made when there is an indication that the difference between the supposed winner of the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the poll is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition of the representative of the party who has presented and / or coali.
The total counting of the ballot may also be carried out if at the end of the joint counting it appears that the difference between the supposed winning candidate and that of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate came out second, in which case the electoral packages that were the subject of the partial counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of driver Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday evening, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the lieutenant-colonel’s last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving tributes from the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the vigil chapel of Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes to the Saltillo Technological Institute organized by his former fellow technologists and the American football team that Felipe Bacio was part of when he was preparing for the bachelor's degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and that his ashes were spread in the Zapalinamé mountain range, he always said this to his family and friends," Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister, said in a statement.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared for his family a lot".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the College of Air in Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he had even truck pain; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n for the graduation of his parent, for this he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His last farewell
With honors was said goodbye to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, who had the Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Institute of Technology.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all officials of this service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be delivered by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents.
Three abandoned bodies, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found shot and killed in different parts of the body and with a blow of grace, on an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery took place at the 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who went through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has the color beige and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, at approximately three meters, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, no shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
One meter away was another individual's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on the stomach.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, because no sockets were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one organized delinquency group to the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the published information, in a first fact on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was saved.
They were confiscated three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed that they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident that took place on November 12 at 06:00, military personnel made a surveillance tour in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on 13 November at 2:00 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested at La Frauda, when he tried to escape while seeing the military.
They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire Eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he would present the president with the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former EU commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The framework is now well laid out," he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, as Italy grapples with a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by former EU commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the yield of Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employers’ Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: “We said we would strongly support this government.”
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by noting that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
On Monday, Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions, employers’ groups and youth and women’s organizations.
He will finish his reunion tour on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over the new prime minister’s success.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the Eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti said his government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before moving the elections forward.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist that it should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that reciprocal mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 named footballers from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 summoned by the two countries for today's friendly, at 15:05 hours, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, have a large register of inter-selection A-class games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
The Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in the powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain intense activities throughout the year in national league and cup championships and disputes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated playoffs of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, by contrast, have limited international experience in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish Selection is that of goaltender <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goaltender Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against La Tricolore and they will set a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, brain flyer of Barcelona, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke forward Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez with 102.
The 100-year-old Carles Puyol has 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana are left-hander J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az, with 48 appearances and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet started.
Spain's historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to give one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to happen in this country.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour and will make its only stopover in Central America on Sunday.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside Los Angeles band The X and Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been grandiose.
I spent in Costa Rica only once on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to spend a few days there.
We are excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us for all these years.
It took us 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the bigger shows we’ve offered over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We gave two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope it put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned, through the people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you had offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never produced there, we have no restrictions as to what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is the reason for this?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can perform over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that’s why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to perform each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t performed in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you will celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
In the first place, I think none of us ever imagined we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for over 20 years makes it sound like a dream.
We continue to recount our blessings and being able to continue making music together is very exciting.
We love each other and we love creating music.
We’re lucky to go to places in the world we’ve always wanted to go.
Things couldn't get any better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of large groups.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to still be friends with all of them and it’s an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
First, I believe we are all lucky to still be alive, and second, we all care about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t get any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity hasn’t been easy; however, thanks to your success, you’ve been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don’t spend too much time touring because it’s easy to get into this game from the big crowds and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are there for the music, it helps us to remember that we have to respect the music and what it brought, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which is not really of interest to any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn’t release a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to talk, to work.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and this was the band we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it has to be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He is the one who sings it and I believe he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge high despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the bands that came up at the same time and, if that matters now, I think it’s wonderful because it’s a music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting, because I think there are songs on the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very obscure songs, even though these may sound a bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there’s a trauma in your life and you lose to a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think we can be happy and even so we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength he has in his feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from a variety of conditions, including tongue cancer for which he has been operated on four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N TV that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has been operated on four times of tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with circulation in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving time in the National Directorate of Special Operations since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of various ministers and bosses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the high point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "propitious for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) "grey list", integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustached plumber moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, was designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who must tell how stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, Nintendo’s specialist press officer in Spain, during the game’s presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", because hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles so far.
The Nintendo spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for a fast and smooth gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the more experienced will be able to make a "second turn" to the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that had not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists of the fact that the mustache plumber must travel through platforms mined with danger to free Princess Peach.
Even though I player find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer to the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus the trial ends for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to try him.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure he had "not helped" in any judicial resolution and had carried out all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did implied an executive approach after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former agent of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzlement of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 at-risk youth
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
To this is added the long centenary of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in an event celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats that more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping uneducated, unemployed, addicted or marginalized people.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Alongside the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the event the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to the mayor and current eco-socialist municipal councilor Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the General Director of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the grand hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President has given Trinijove as an example to know how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in trouble.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-feasts, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Balmes Street were living has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left at noon yesterday the building they illegally occupied and where they organized micro-feasts that despaired neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From that day on, there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the occupation of the building her business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made her unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation room had to respond to complaints from neighbors about the noise, while, according to her, the trouble was not caused by the guests of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the troubles were so great that she even ended up in an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months that he "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the city hall, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had last week called for "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common life and civility that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also robberies.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in property".
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police moved to 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed four people entering the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the expediency of the convocation beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors again opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already-extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed advertising posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that is not oriented on the north-south axis, but high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi Bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition composed of 16 contests for all the access gates to Collserola.
A door brings back to the idea of a park, without a doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors to the field.
The question arises on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city is a topic of conversation for all the architects of Barcelona.
It’s almost a recurring theme that two members of this former cast of elected officials talk about when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have presented themselves.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green blocks has not been carried out.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "gates of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one should not think of these "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
Dangers that stem from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the '80s and which had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
“To limit something means to already establish the next step,” that is, its overcoming.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) ] can cause genuine disasters".
By sticking more to the question, Modol believes that, by simplifying, the side of the region El Valles de Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already work done by the Patronat of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the city council offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he hears that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("very successful", he says) that we had to create: "We architects, should only be an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the bases of the competition there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "We have called 16 cross-sectional competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he opted to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately above that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino Forgives Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and He Will Be Released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, Casino Red's founding father granted pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the lawsuit filed against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 years in prison, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal will be released after the founder of the legal power of Casino Red grants him pardon before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a lawsuit for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s allegedly demanded payment of an economic fee for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of Mayor PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Agent of the Public Prosecution Service 3 of Patrimony Offences, he was transferred to the Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was issued a second arrest warrant after the Public Prosecutor's Office dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadereyta Penal Center allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On October 25, a warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine the guilt of Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing its operation.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could regain his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Prosecutor's agent attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez if the damage had been recovered and who of the gambling house's associates had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and subsequently no claim can be made regarding the trial brought against him; no compensation for damages and no punishment will be sought from him either.
After the court hearing, at 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n's immediate release was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, traveled to the prison of the municipality of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to inform Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s that he had been legally pardoned and his file would be closed.
It will also communicate to him the order of immediate freedom that the judge has issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come gives details of the plane crash in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter struck directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements for transporting personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations made in the impact area do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was presented in a structural way.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, General Manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter was operating at cruise speed and it happened on a soft ascending ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, TBS incumbent Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was performed according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the IACM mentioned adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-level cloud layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew searched for a lower height area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact took place on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The dispersion model of the aircraft debris makes it possible to assume that the helicopter collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
At the site of the accident, there is still no trace of any type of explosion or fire in the remains of the aircraft.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During fieldwork, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above average sea level, the ground had a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides evidence that appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful research in an area wider than the encircled area, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact took place under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find the Obesity Gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called the ‘Children’s and Adolescents’ Obesity Genetics Protocol’ which will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialties Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites the participation of the population with or without the right, to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence to minors is carried out every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation is to know the components and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for preventing the onset of chronic degenerative diseases in Mexican children and youth.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of the specific questionnaires related to food.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of their diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics will be applied to all participants (searches to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez pointed out that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there was a 77 percent increase in obesity among boys and 47 percent for girls, and a dramatic increase in overweight," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the rationale for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the integral evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored pleats (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, who explain each of the measures and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV for most of the day and using means of transportation instead of walking for short distances.
Another cause is high calorie intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meatballs with cornmeal wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200,000 blackcurrants each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who has assured that if the process of building and maintaining the same bituminous pavement is adequate, the same blackcurrants could be reduced or reduced.
During his lecture A Technological Opinion on Blackcurrants, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and consequently, the formation of blackcurrants.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles pass through it generating forces, it allows the forces to propagate very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would propagate better, the chemical engineer thought.
On the asphalt layer, he said, a last layer called a rolling layer is put, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip on the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes blackcurrants.
In the process of forming a blackcurrant, he says, the first one that breaks is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be taken care of at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrant and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrant.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and make it possible to repair blackcurrant easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her 14th title of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico went up with the crown and the scepter), Isabel Alcéra (1989), Garcéla Alcéra (1989), Garéra Alcéra (1989), Garéra Alcéra Alcéra (1989), Garéra Alcéra Alcéra (1989), Garéra Alcéra Alcéra (1989), Garéra Alcéra Alcéra Alcéra Alcéra Alcéra Alcéra Alcéra Alcéra Alcéra Alcéra Alcéra Alcé (1989, Alcéra Alcéra Alcéra Alcé (1989, Alcéna, Alcéra Alcéna, Alcéra Alcéna, Alcéna, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcéna, Alcéra Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcéla, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcéla, Alcéla, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcéla, Alcéna, Alcé, Alcé, Alcéna, Alcéna, Alcé, Alcéna, Alcé, Al<0xC3><0xA8>na, Alcéna, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Alcéla, Alcé, Almer, Alcé, Alcé, Alcé, Al<0xC3><0xA8>na, Alcéla, Ala, Alcéla, Almer, Almer, Ala, Al<0xC3><0xA8>na, Maré, Al<0xC3><0xA8>na, Almer, Al<0xC3><0xA8>na, Alen, Alen, Al<0xC3><0xA8>na, Almer, Almer, Almer, Almer, Alen, Al<0xC3><0xA8>na, Maré, Alm, Alcé, Maré, Al<0xC3><0xA8>ra, Al<0xC3><0xA8>ra, Al<0xC3><0xA8>na, Al
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of Police and Best Pretty Face of Vogue, titles obtained by Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Missvarro who carried her away.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it is a form of culturalization, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it is a book quite deep.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
This response did not please firstly because of the term "culturalize" and secondly because it did not explain concretely how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses put forward is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> hinted that being the favorite, the ovated and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "this aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that is why she did not shine on the stage".
And we noted this in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Although at both parades she seemed sure of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for RCN's "Como en casa" program, said the fact that Melina was named a princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who wins most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press in the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social necessities of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before starting the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his flaws in his back and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens trainer Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left points on the last day".
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the candidate of Valle were the surgical interventions that she had undergone.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle hasn't been able to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect.”
For this prize, which the National Beauty Contest presents for the first time, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel prediction arose that was fulfilled last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Contest.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A typist from Cali has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a typist from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability" of Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in the municipalities of Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking adequate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who ran the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team at the place of the corpse, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much leaner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a sampler and a lantern, Eliazar compared the body’s fingerprints with those on the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a typist from Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can be crucial in solving crimes.
Aside from identifying the bodies, typists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of those captured.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have any documents.
We take their fingerprints and search the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove a part of the wall of a house, because in that place the thief had pressed his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to take a fingerprint from, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint from the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different robberies,” he recalls.
Footprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be a suspect in the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it puts him on the crime scene.
A CTI typist explained that "fingerprints of objects are extracted with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a sampler or strip is used to collect them.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of declines, or to the National Civil Registry.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Since everything that shines is not gold, everything that one touches does not necessarily become an imprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is carried out.
Indignados challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were jostling in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people acceded to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, through a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were scrambling in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the 'indignants' to camp again in that place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp in the square again, we will settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the “indignants” to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, went all the way to the courts, where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the indignants occupied a new park at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue power stations, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church Parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization claims that there were hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in as a sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene in their behalf before the Police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned enclosure - remains closed pending the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which we must analyze the legality of this morning's evacuation.
Some of the protesters who had been displaced so far were carrying and distributing copies of the court order at that time and even handing it over to police officers guarding the square, causing “certain small clashes,” said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing “laws issued after the beginning of the occupation or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but warned them that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because the demonstrators were 'violating the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm other people", because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
“This morning’s early morning evacuation was repugnant and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending financial interests than American workers,” the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “failing to respect freedom of expression.”
"Occupy Wall Street" officials also said they do not plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be appearing on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crue", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a crib a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian who recently featured a part of Charlie Sheen’s “My Violent Torpedo of Truth,” appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV’s special Noel program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is himself not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian 'pute' during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after the earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral at the beginning of March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, recuperating even after the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Government of Tokyo have estimated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the challenging global environment, appears to have abated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data on Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn the page definitively: GDP rose 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rates.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also represents the largest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% drop in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from zero.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This increased by 1%, driven by higher spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo recovered to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "safe haven values" chosen by investors fleeing the euro zone debt crisis and U.S. forecast turmoil, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic fluctuation is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their poor results between July and September the contribution of the yen.
While markets continue to be headquartered in peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government does not let down its guard.
“We need to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that the majority of member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the world economy has highlighted that key powers are being held back.
Because it dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is in the 100 level, n dropping eight decimal places up to 99.13 points.
Athens once again fuels doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but Conservatives won’t sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty resettled in parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the labyrinth that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, signaled yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period established in his designation may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit of October 26," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not cast doubt on his position: "We have pledged to help the Transitional Government, but we have committed to nothing more."
The conservative leader has gone one step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not release aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "an unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika's inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses Spain's "preponderant" place in this type of finance
Spain "has reached a predominant place at the global level in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people who live with incomes by one dollar".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originated during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", these main beneficiaries.
We have “achieved a lot of goals” and “we face a lot of challenges”.
The Microcredit Summit is envisaged not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are getting out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work of which she has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know on the ground her lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project yesterday brought him the qualifier of "head of family" gathered in Valladolid by the "banking of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits presuppose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of the developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let this be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the "excluded people to whom everyone closes the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European president by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially foreseen in the programme but was imposed in the autumn, especially to satisfy activists who consider the government's policy too lax towards Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which Angela Merkel and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile finance minister, were entitled, after their speeches, did not leave room for doubt.
The chancellor's master idea - and the motion - fits in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could lead to changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the fiscal policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe".
At any rate, this is one of the motion's proposals adopted by the Congress, which is clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight each country's weight on the European Central Bank's board of directors according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted to strengthening Germany's weight.
Concerned to appease the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But neither has she sought to win her congress on the back of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is Sickness Stop Fraud?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family allowance fund, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and welfare.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of rigor, but is no less forerunner of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick stops.
Firstly, with a view to budgetary savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day of absence on private employees before taking charge of a work stoppage.
In short, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks arousing anger, but that would make it possible to raise 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: to impose on civil servants an uncompensated day of absence in the event of work stoppage (they do not have until now a period of absence, compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority is also reviving the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The checks will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will be reimbursed," Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday.
As in other cases, the ad effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
Since 2002, it has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives, which have mostly paid off.
The French are no sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM), more than €237 million in daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and occupational accidents, and 54% concerned sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
That’s 2.5% of health care expenses.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had taken no sick days.
Another study, this time from the Health Insurance , specifies that in 2010, 37% of the illness stops were of a duration of less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined to work stoppages than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (whether for health reasons or not) in France ranged between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness arrest fraud represents very little compared to working in the dark.
As for fraud, it only reaches a small scale.
The tightening of legislation since 2002 means systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of "unsuitable or unjustified" cases out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, therefore, 169,000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who have had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little compared, for example, to that of work in black.
According to MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax shortfall per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to straighten out its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said in Parliament on Monday, November 14, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to restore the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of fiscal adjustment," said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on 27 October will be the “main task” of the new government, as the country’s participation in the euro zone “is at stake,” he added.
As a result, Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right wing, on Monday supported measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to further austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the goals of reducing the deficit and debt, and fighting waste, but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without written assurance from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
EU legalizes euthanasia and assisted suicide, says expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to Royal Society of Canada report
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
For starters, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, this rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference, there would be more cases of such overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Downie said.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Eighty-five percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled have less value.
As for people who have committed assisted suicide, the respondents estimate that 41% should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing care for a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee calls for it to be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and for it to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts who signed the report "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over the age of 18 could ask for help in committing suicide,” said Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
“In society,” he said, “there are beacons and constraints.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly disputes the report's data on non-abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, namely in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Leave Power
Damascus denounces "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday outside the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a “plot” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, took a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces have been killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country where Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have been killed in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed "during exchanges of fire and shelling with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "going towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria “will not bend,” he added, assuring that “the plots against Syria will fail.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and is seeking the deployment of 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he said is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the plan for the exit from the crisis decided on November 2, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the grip of the protests and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to exit the crisis, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU commissioner was in talks with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important program with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the president of the appointed council.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a short list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certainly the markets will be patient and will understand".
His appointment by the president was initially hailed by the markets, but the concern has regained the upper hand especially after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should form a team of mostly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti undertook, once he took office, to work urgently and with the aim of making Italy "a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not meet its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new measures of rigor.
Italian boss Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that does not have growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "period change" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconismo", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
A Russian Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. nuclear risk NGO said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents emanating from this UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA last week expressed "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, reportedly worked for three decades starting in the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he allegedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then reportedly cooperated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA cites "strong indications that Iran's development of" a nuclear detonation system "was aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within his home country's military nuclear program."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and misdemeanors against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence declined slightly or made little progress, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has risen very slightly to 6,628, of which 47.3% are motivated by differences in race and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and misdemeanors increase again,” Human Rights First said in a statement, adding that “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a senior official at Human Rights First.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he added, adding that this could lead to improved police reporting on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legislation had been passed after Martin Luther King’s death to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter introduced changes Monday in the presentation of its platform, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" make it possible to follow more legibly, live the activity of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they are following messages, subscribe to new accounts, have favorite messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being released to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast someone else's message, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users debated with "tweets" on the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, intrusive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” wrote <0x40>jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed," said <0x40>dannykronstrom.
Austria-Hungary
Inclusion of a "golden rule" in the Constitution
The government of the ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democrat grand coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "golden rule" budget in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the criterion of 60% maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were lowered by just one notch, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional €3 billion in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, vice-chancellor and Christian Democratic foreign minister.
Austria is thus responding to a request from the summit in Brussels of the member countries of the euro area on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", Germany having been the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal state will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states as well as the municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty to 2020/21.
Yen fort
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historic levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new vigor record since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has steadily risen since, doped by purchases from investors who see it as a “safe haven” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar rose below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency hurts exports from the archipelago as it increases the cost of products made in Japan and reduces the value of foreign income earned by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern Tohoku region, said Noda, who fears that the yen's price rise will kill the fragile recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy resumed growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption led by the disaster.
But the prime minister said the high price of the yen did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", implying that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuance institute increased its purchases of treasury bonds by 5 trillion yen (47 billion euros) to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling on the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the rates are rising, the stock markets are waning
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weaker countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro zone, European stock exchanges are sinking a little more into negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt sells 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With new strains on borrowing yields from struggling eurozone states, equity markets around the world continue to make a portion of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, in turn suffering renewed fears from market participants about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow fluctuation corridor until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro zone penalizes the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it backed down after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, met in congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the “main task” of his government.
Spain finds itself in the spotlight of the markets, as legislative elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
In anticipation of euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, the INSEE revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a 0.1% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, it is really the fourth one that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., as the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If there is one subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is healthy that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place nuclear energy holds.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will result in a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless it deprives a huge portion of the world’s population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to overcome the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity permanently, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is neither the case of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which just intends to build only the latest generation of power plants.
Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their plans with determination.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by resuming construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, an energy dependence exacerbated by the increased use of imported gas, especially from Russia, a jump in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
Within a few months, all these unpleasant effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated on.
European champion of wind, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; under which, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show opposition in principle to this energy, the polls show.
Let us remember that our country’s energy policy has built an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them very creative of non-relocatable jobs.
If France were to decide to exit nuclear, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing as a skin of grief the 6 billion euros per year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years when the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miraculous electricity production, nor is there any diabolical one.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a safety authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power plants and the Flamanville construction site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the French and German safety authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it able to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them free to take the lead in the unavoidable development of nuclear.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the politics of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming in passing that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on both the left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be deigned to be accorded to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande confines himself to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may pay electorally; but it is economically very costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among scholars on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth.
Restricting immigration anemia growth and harms employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace national workers, especially the low-skilled, who are putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mainly working in sectors where there is a shortage of jobs.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows leads to an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of real wages in the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of €150,000 to public budgets on average over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, European democracy remains to be thought of
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would suffice, for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon the Little, that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public mind, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis of the Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also and first of all a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have been a double revealer in this respect: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought of in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to necessity and in dispersed order.
A whistle-blower to the absolute European monarch or a leap into the emptiness of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but a common, full-fledged, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - we can no longer stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that is bowing to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is being humiliated on the international stage.
There are concerns about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
Because together, Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After having long opposed this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Oh, yeah.
But to think of it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
"Contactless" smart cards are becoming more widespread
The world's smart card fair opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end on an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or pay for your purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region and is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces make the bites double.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards.
To take the next step, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed to systematically distribute to their customers in the future bank cards equipped for contactless," said Gérard Nébouy, General Manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology essential for carrying out transactions.
“They were late.”
“But they should finally see a real boom next year.”
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale, too, said yesterday it was preparing to put an offer on the market allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is expanding
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected for a long time, ties between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's deputy foreign minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
“The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation,” he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their captors in an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerien investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the calls made points to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect is receiving financial and intellectual support from outside and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operating methods, which now involve the use of suicide bombs or explosive devices increasingly complex and of the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as an enlightened community of little interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is enjoying rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for sharia law while its militants engage in the fight against the impious central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, multiplying attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, nuanceless.
The army invades the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on, the sect would radicalize and leave its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the secure police headquarters during a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, and al-Shebab Somalis are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic, ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying thunderous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsubstantiated - are fusing.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the nomination of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and question them "for manipulation of their currency", a theme that has carried in an America exasperated by the migration of entire sections of its industry to Asia.
Worse if it means starting a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that “flatters” emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will arrest Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also vowed to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop nuclear capability” – seemingly ignorant of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who backs Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine when it came to counterterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his misrepresentations in Libya, thus sticking a label of weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
Obama’s national security assessment, which eliminated bin Laden, is seen as positive by the public.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to stalemate.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The Nord Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe to Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly connects, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned the wheel of the valve together commanding the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first 1,224 km tube connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second tube is due to be completed at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third one on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction site looks like victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic States.
Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any overland passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close off its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of the energy Europe, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has triumphed over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, gas-consuming Western countries whose deposits are in decline.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us organically," confirmed Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon when he inaugurated this pipeline, demonstrating how big gas contracts are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of steel lined with concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
“A hundred had to be kidnapped or destroyed, as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
There was also a need for more measures to protect the flora and fauna.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts along its entire length: neither valve, nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but project officials gave it up while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state-owned company permanently set up off their coasts.
“In case of damage, we stop the gas flowing in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline thus escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds for a leak every 100,000 years.
The state of the pipeline is monitored by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus that circulates inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, one meter wide, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters second, it provides accurate information on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars on departure, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch company Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company’s entire gas transmission capacity for a renewable period of 20 years.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” Müller said.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was ensured at 30% by the shareholders and at 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure to go back to their expenses, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the incoming gas before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, that will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventure, of hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
Yet the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook of design notes but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which designates a varnished cotton used to cover benches for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought to life an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces sold.
We are far from the confidential production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, because the notebook appeals to both the businessman and the student and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now has almost 100 employees and since 2008 has two offices; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city center and has managed to impose her identity.
“We have followed the times and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched a "Detour" exhibition where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, diary, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a whole range of supports.
A success that made envious: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for Disabled Employment opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy implemented in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is still twice the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the whole population.
Disheartening?
“No,” says <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
“The progress made in the last fifteen years is considerable.”
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"However, there is still a great deal to be done."
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before accessing employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to an average of 38%.
In short, all these criteria that make it very difficult to return to work, and which "constitute the core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, general manager of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit workers with disabilities.
This is for objective brakes.
The unspoken remains, the mentalities that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers interviewed have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disabled ".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law of 1987.
The last known figures, which date from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, general manager of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is that the number of "taxed" institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also translates into real awareness, especially in large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "That of happiness"
Before facing Les Bleus on Tuesday evening (8:45pm) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after his striker's mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
“I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian.”
"I want to move forward," says the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances at the club and in the selection, "it is a whole, he justified himself."
“In Lille, I’m there all year, which is not the case with Belgium.”
“I have to take my marks.”
Famed against Romania on Friday night in preparation for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
However, without omitting the notion of "pleasure".
The Blues, he encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a supporter,” he says.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
Especially since in front, "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We crossed paths earlier."
"To be able to play against them is nothing but happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens for his part spoke of "proudness".
"Pride" to play "a gala game".
"Pride" also to note -as a "neighbor"- that France has "become a team of very high level" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc did a thunderous job,” he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would see himself sharing the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting big,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll realize it in the next games." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal are optimistic about their return to Bosnia at 10 p.m. on Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, both teams were lacking in realism.
“At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao, of which he has been in charge since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to be played, and an opponent, Bosnia, to be knocked out.
In view of the first game (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but they were unable to score this valuable goal, which would have relieved them.
"It's a good result, but there's some risk involved because we haven't scored a goal outside."
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there also boiling, even if the game is obviously "very tight ", dixit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
“We expect a very close match, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The nil reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
One draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it does involve some risk because we didn't score a goal outside," Bento said.
“We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the outset so as not to "give them time to think."
That’s a good idea, as long as you’re realistic this time around.
