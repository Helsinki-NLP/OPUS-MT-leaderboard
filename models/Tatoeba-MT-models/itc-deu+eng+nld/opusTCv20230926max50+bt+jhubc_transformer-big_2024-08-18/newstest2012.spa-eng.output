Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Penal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former prime minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia disadvantageous to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet firm, the appellate court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former prime minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
The victory of Libya
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
It remains to be determined who is the winner.
As is already customary in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of whether they are moderates or radicals.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the sharia, which we already know to a certain extent.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because thieves will be cut off.
Women may already be forgetting to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of by the person of the dictator, society, composed of warrior tribes, will unite by the Quran.
In Libya an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and it probably did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When looking for victors in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, it is not a problem for the locals to expel the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies be able to get the Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible not, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of sharia do not cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are on the hunt for investors
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual states have released their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the quarter-on-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors no longer look only to Italy, but also to Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5%, France’s by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data of the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the quarter-on-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A> the trend towards a gradual slowdown in the growth of economic development conforms.
The results are even worse than analysts’ predictions.
Main events:
Interannually, the Czech economy grew in the third quarter of this year by 1.5%, but has stagnated quarterly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest on their ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest in Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on Czech 10-year bonds remains at 4%, although the situation in the area is deteriorating.
In Germany, there are rumors that the ECB should ultimately lend.
The Czechs qualify for the European Championship.
They won 1:0 and celebrated the classification with a premium of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, the victory was 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically against the attacks of the home team, so it will not miss the European championship appointment.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in detail in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the home team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of <0xC4><0x8C>ech and heroic Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates their passage to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured in the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who missed two big occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup appointment, so that the coffers of national football will receive a gratification of approximately 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes, a good offensive game was played.
Both teams were committed only to maintaining the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicking the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense was able to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying Tuesday at noon outside the facilities and then chanted death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the nuclear technology center in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, by all indications, is struggling to obtain nuclear weapons.
There is talk in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the objective of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan plant but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would be reached.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with overweight, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It again demonstrates the importance of the environment where you grow for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessed children feed, for example, on sausages at least twice as often as children from families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence."
In families of overweight children there is no practice of sports, which is applicable to most families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of the last school year and almost 900 elementary school children from all over the Czech Republic participated in it.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children from the 4th to the 8th grade have participated in the project.
A proper diet and plenty of exercise in the family are determinants, which significantly decrease the number of overweight and even obese children.
"Only half of the children surveyed responded that they have five meals per day according to the regimen: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," one of the survey results said.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each breakfasts alone.
But the worst thing was discovering that in 10% of households nothing is eaten at breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, insane chips are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas on a daily basis (70%).
As a general rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed play sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Build your diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
“The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal.”
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
“The popularity of sweet sodas is especially alarming,” the study’s final report warns.
As the main meal, the pasta is taken from the palm and the poultry meat is closely followed.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a major change in favor of the principles of healthy eating," the results of the study point out.
It draws attention, for example, to sweet sodas, where many children would begin to prefer normal running water.
Children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for the main meal and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of entertainment.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have perfect symmetry.
And that is the vast majority.
Someone is short-skinned, someone has a stylized figure without the proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to make the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez stand out, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress her in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth having at least one extra piece of fabric sewn to measure.
They will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are priceless.
With a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or draped.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have all week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I am afraid that with the assigned task, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom he must design two locker rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I've had to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
The dresses we have to cut them from the magazines or search them on the internet and print them, then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what the complete result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist, therefore, does not only wear physically, but also deals, for example, with the pages of products in magazines (concrete topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
About all this the stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k told us.
But all this remains for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests animated the conference on Saturday with information on all types of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a coat (or as they say in English, trench coat) can be dressed to the classic with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or you just have to roll it up and up your neck to get a totally different image.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value the most is the following advice: "To start working, you must first know all the rules."
“Then you can break them,” Jakub said.
At last it is clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing in reserve than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes works in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> assured us that image and style alone, in many cases, make up half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, it should be borne in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate a size very different from their real (minor).
Then you just have to gossip and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has become fattened / thinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion, but he has to understand outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn’t miss them, he defends their opinions.
“When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and complete it with pretty clothes, you can’t take everything and throw it away and say, ‘Oh, how horrible!’”
“Find at least a couple of things that you can ponder and recommend so someone can put them on,” Mario says.
He himself also showed us that everything should fit into the so-called "placovka", that is, the labor market.
This is fixed around the waist and you have there all the necessary tools.
They are objects such as scissors, such as scissors, hair removers, or unmissable. There are also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special clips of hooking clothes ahead, if it was older (pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing set.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole and much more the exterior could be damaged.
And we did nothing but clothe and clothe.
We could not touch the shoes with scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skillful.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I don’t get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I’ve already realized that professional styling isn’t a rosy path, but it doesn’t matter what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run you can compete all over America.
Resen<0xC3><0xA7>a
A journey, in principle carefree, is complicated due to a series of improper neglects of a routine journey during tomorrow's shift.
To a certain extent it was possible to meet expectations, but this does not help, if, in reality, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new installment, to which The Run is added to the title, aroused high expectations already before its premiere.
It promised to give fresh air to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as shown, appears as a game that should not end up being an action genre again without more.
We are also curious to know how the inserted scenes would look, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case with NFS series, the results don’t vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be taken for granted, but in the total count points are lost due to absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In reality they cannot even be called errors, but rather they are the incomprehensible failure of the programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graphic is equivalent to that of previous installments of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you must be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of opponents (normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (timed classic duel) and then a duel against a single opponent awaits you.
In the middle of all this sometimes appears the police, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you would expect (specifically there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can already look elsewhere.
But a race conceived with enough action is quite suitable for this driving style, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, all in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correctness of driving models, collisions are no longer the same.
From games of this type you can't expect it to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that, when making a very tight overtaking or driving the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or leave the track, the game restores you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race there are only five resets available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is nothing more than a help in case something goes wrong, but it is not very reliable.
Sometimes, even resetting doesn’t help, it just helps to learn the given stage from memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find somewhere "civilian" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes sooner or later.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It is the same when you arrive, because it is programmed because the “surprise” will always happen before your noses.
The adversaries also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always advance you in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming in front of you, so at first you can spoil the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that you will surely be disappointed right away.
And it’s a shame, because even though the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the ranking in the race so it doesn’t fit boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is changing cars during races.
You have to be attentive to the gas pumps next to the road, because precisely there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will suffice what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example on curved mountain roads.
In addition to the main narrative thread, there is also a parallel thread of challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending up with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community features.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is done.
With the car you reach the subway tunnel (pass), where you start to run in the dark on the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km / h (pass) and suddenly, behind you the subway convoy arrives and is carried in front of you without more.
In the drafting we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors really think of us as a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
Well, what a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to be liked by most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for its music.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It feels like the game isn’t over.
The fun is assured, but get ready because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of airport spotlights.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>:
The Czechs have a reputation for being negative and eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
“I didn’t expect a war without a barracks.”
"It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
How not to take seriously his motto "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each organ of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers of the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.
Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also pondered the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
“The first thing that comes up is the criticism, that if he’s stupid, a gray official, capable of taking on any role, but I have to say that he left everyone baffled, because he takes on his roles perfectly.”
“He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, to communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.”
The new post of representative for Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban Olomouc cheese.
Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> has also taken up the agenda for the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good uproar", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the seven-year EU budget, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive the most support and which will receive the least?
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Europe: "About Europe clearly".
“The truth is, I don’t like ugly abbreviations, aliens, or jargon that people don’t understand.”
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban us Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speeds is waiting for us
According to the ambassador, Czechs are known as Eurosceptics and people perceive the negatives rather than the positives.
He also regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame lies on a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman by my side says, ‘What, you have already left, the Visegrad Group?’
In the future, according to Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, the EU is awaiting tough new fiscal policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the procedure of enhanced cooperation."
“It was said for the first time that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, stay out.”
"These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen the Europe of the two speeds," Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> hopes.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the entire EU must be discussed among member states, not only among eurozone members.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were looking for a term that would define IBM’s strategy with great precision, the most approximate would be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet it has already been a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-term character was laid by the firm’s first head, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
Its slogan "Think!" became its hallmark, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully crafted corporate culture.
“For us, IBM involves long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century,” said current company director Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as early as the 1930s, cared for his employees as the Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a businessman in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American operators to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
Already from the beginning the company was able to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to end any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, by which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which arise countless future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that ideas arise, since in the firm almost half a million people work.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technology company,” says Harvard Business School economist Professor and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of the technology,” says George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and software, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on moving forward, you can’t anchor yourself emotionally in the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano said.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and equally, if they don’t work, it abandons them).
And this is the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically always stays and falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one-fifth are from programs and another fifth from equipment.
However, even in 1990, equipment accounted for more than half of the supplier share.
As of the year 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets worth a total of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in buying future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM acts on the premise of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far the IBM company has managed to overcome the crisis.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the company's net profit has not stopped increasing.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be hoped that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From the Cheese Cutter to Spaceflight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The IBM name was adopted as early as 1924 - originally it was a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave rise to IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He owned inventions such as the famous "sign-up clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint signed up the head of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson led the company, revenue doubled by $9 million and the company’s massive expansion across the continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly forty years in the boss’ chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pieces", which established the standard of computers of that time, came to the market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering comprehensive advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for these last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances have not improved, for example, in terms of transport and city administration.
For the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 it opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> about her cheating husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), but also her lover, Darina remained hopeful that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
“Pepe can come home, but not as my partner anymore,” Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> explained.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> welcomed Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ové into her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Eventually, Darina resigned herself, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychyt<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out.”
“But here I would live no longer as my dear, old donkey who was wrong, but as a man to whom I am bound by certain ties,” Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said, adding that she had already disengaged herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
So far Josef doesn't care if his wife has closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
“I will be with Iveta and there is no possible change.”
“My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
"The company is still in place, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I spoke normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> found a new love, he would not oppose it.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that manage to boil the blood of men?
Go shopping
Do you blame your orange stocking for being dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one trapeze a week?
Do you like to shop often at sales?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should allay their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But let’s see, what woman could resist the temptation to just stroll through the clothing stores, look for tight-fitting clothes and then test them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically a hell.
Just remember how many times you have already told your partner to wait for you in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I would need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
“Do you really like me?”
Don't you hear these phrases?
What do you mean?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite loop.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for having soiled a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that cost you so much to clean?
In case you suffer this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should surely not be of paramount importance in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"Wearing panties is left with dirty clothes."
"You want to put on those used socks tomorrow, too."
"The wet rag is not left on the floor!"
If you do these comets to your partner more times a day, know that this way you will be able to get it out of your boxes.
Naturally. You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, on the other hand, would not make so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women also get slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, which is why they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless gossip.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossiping women who don’t control themselves, who love to gossip and often do, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped beat Philadelphia with assists
Hockey striker Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr took part in the NHL game on Monday with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and put Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's move, and took one more step and was declared the best player of the match.
Two assists were awarded in the match and also J<0xC3><0xA1>gr's teammate, Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the meeting, J<0xC3><0xA1>gr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Before the match I told him I'd make a triple."
“I presented it.”
"Sometimes they look like ambush," J<0xC3><0xA1>gr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first trench.
After a while, the team’s second intervention also had a Czech track.
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek took the record from behind the Hurricanes' goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second half they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with J<0xC3><0xA1>gr he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through Wayne Simmonds' fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player on the court, but he’s definitely in the top three,” J<0xC3><0xA1>gr said.
“I never would have thought that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him.”
"I'm very satisfied with that."
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my teammates were playing for me, and that now produces results,” added J<0xC3><0xA1>gr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then Dwyer's penalty again, until they got a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up outnumbered by two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I got it," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With its victory, Philadelphia has placed itself at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an upper body injury.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of defense experience, but also by a two-goal difference, 2:3.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec did not know how to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and play the match only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novices."
“In short, but there’s nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
“So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn’t resist it.”
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
“And so we left gaps,” explained one of the defenders, P.K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed 30 wins to Winnipeg's 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were scored by five players who put an end to a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of the time sold in most cases trips only to the socialist bloc, as trips to the West were very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and travel of Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually, even in socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise, individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but one had to queue up with a sleeping bag and spend the night, or have "good acquaintances" at the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way the Czechs travel has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, that the presently favourite destination, Croatia, could not be traveled freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, visa-free travel to neighbouring Western European states was imposed, prompting a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, were not tired of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in the parks in tents, since our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was taking food (preserves, sausages, etc.) with them to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was rising and with it also the average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in the demand for travel agencies began, starting in 1997, regularly, to prepare travel using the connections of charter flights, which caused travel prices to fall incredibly compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the late 1990s, Czechs were traveling visa-free to almost every developed country except the U.S., which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened as early as 2000, when the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, thanks to a huge demand, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists depart every year to distant and hot countries. This winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this epoch, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, more than 15,000 Czech kroner per head have been spent on trips abroad, including expenses at the site of stay.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, who could end up deadlocked again.
For almost five months Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June not without first summoning his colleagues with the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, a controversy arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (N<0xC3><0xA1>rodn<0xC3><0xAD> d<0xC5><0xAF>m), located in the Prague neighborhood of Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, because the talks had been blocked and not only as to the method of election.
No consensus was reached on who in the General Assembly was entitled to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed even by the Executive Committee, which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically resolved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three FA<0xC4><0x8C>R vice-presidents, who, from the association's management, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round, the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy will win.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that that candidate can win with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," Svoboda said, according to which it would be best not to touch order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Surprisingly, he also agrees with Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, although it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates are more suited to Pelta.
"I would like to have the maximum vote in accordance with the statutes."
“So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as at the last General Assembly,” says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
“All the passions will be appeased with today’s match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will once again play a leading role, and we will cooperate more comfortably," says the representative of Jablonice, which of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
“It’s not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
“Anyway, I hope common sense will be imposed,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, they say, will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (<0xC4><0x8C>STV) which will try to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the lottery house Sazka.
Paclik will fight for the presidency because he can’t find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclik, before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not present himself as a candidate for such a relevant position.
“If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and not running for election.”
"But to this day we have not been able to find such a person," Paclik told the Czech News Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>TK).
What motivates Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the election, which paves the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R).
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too closely related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people I could consider.”
“For me it was crazy to hear some people say that at this moment they don’t even want to identify with Czech football.”
“I would like to change that view,” he adds.
What’s supposedly most annoying to Paclik right now is Pelta’s relationship with Pilsen Roman Berbr’s Regional Football Association President, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegates’ voting in the general assembly.
For Paclik it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
“If he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change.”
“With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will profit even less,” Paclik said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was associated with a wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out with impunity.
“I don’t know what prestige football could bring to Pelta’s victory.”
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paclik, who also takes with some caution his earlier statement that "I would sell Club Pilsen if Pelta became president."
In the event of winning Thursday’s election, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Of the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine him, for example, as head of the representation."
"but not as an association manager."
"I also don't put my nose where I don't feel able," added Paclik, who in September drew much attention for supporting the suspension of the Referees Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He relies on his management skills of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated in May the triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeals committee, producing unpleasant situations, said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k without hiding his antipathies towards Spartan president Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport from lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key issues the new president should be devoting himself to."
“If they were to raise taxes on gambling, as the political parties are announcing, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to end up,” he said.
In addition, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k now does not even take into account his association with Club Pilsner, although he himself claims that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R President must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
“But I don’t see any sense in hypocritically ceding my shares of the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half,” Paclik said.
Pelta promised the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes that would end the deadlock in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would have new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve, in the future, disputes regarding the electoral rules.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the unelected elections in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this postponement of two months could do well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new president on Thursday."
“They feel it’s time for someone to run the association,” thinks the man who mainly associates with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the Association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly passed statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta said.
Exactly the readjustment of the Civic Association’s most important document was used as a decoy to win over delegates.
“If I’m elected president, I’ll take it as a personal challenge and I’m willing to respond in case this fails.”
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we can’t exist,” Pelta says.
Also, in theory, try not to mess with your opponents.
In the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
He had not attacked Thomas Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k for a long time, who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with a head.
"He's been in the world of football for over a year, and he's already achieved some successes."
“Their attacks but they were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign.”
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the highest competitions.
The latter should be a showcase for football promotion.
“I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Immediately afterwards I would engage in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal changes to the squad.
“I would have to know the tasks of each employee first,” he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios being predicted at the upcoming general assembly, he believes delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
“If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would begin to work eagerly.
If the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that if elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
He is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work started by former President Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I would like to devote myself entirely to football.”
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
“With this I don’t mean I would do it all alone,” Rajchl said in an interview for the <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide the executive committee’s competencies in such a way that each member can dedicate themselves to a specific area.”
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
“A lot of people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, he is said to have considered not running again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step," he said.
“A lot of people have told me not to give up, because then everyone else would give up too.”
“It’s about having faith so you don’t give up like that, no more,” he said.
They say it also motivates him to continue the work that has already begun with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work was finished that I don’t want to be lost now.”
"There are processes that had been started and that will have an effect in a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, adding that he was concerned that if the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the association could be the same again as it was before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek's time.
“I believe in order, and it’s something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
“Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a select few.”
“I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
"I try to be objective."
“I want to make football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the elected,” Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
“Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to do my utmost for Moravia.”
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech part and a Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division."
“It wouldn’t be the current situation where we have only three Moravian teams, which is a problem for young Moravian players,” Rajchl said.
Although Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, president of Club Pilsner, joined the presidential election, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
“I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, which chose me as its vice president and knows that behind me are clear successes,” said Rajchl, whose successes include saving a few tens of millions of crowns from disadvantageous contracts, negotiations of television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his share of guilt in the fact that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is “disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football,” he regards the other rival, Paclik, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
“I don’t want to use that in my favor,” he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
One book shows where the best well-being in the water is.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missing in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying with her back on the water, she gazed at the artistic dome on top, swam towards the marble angels, who waited for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and one city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
It doesn’t want to have anything to do with the sport, Meder says, only the water is different.
It only bothers bathgoers that they have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can breathe in the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the cheerful birdsongs in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The splashing in the pool and the ethereal oils in the sauna The well-being factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are taken care of, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, indoor pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of soil, in the bathrooms you have a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is folded optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector, discovers the outstanding specimens of her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as Budapest’s 100-year-old Széchenyi bath, there are nitrate waters in a unique karst cavity (cavity baths in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are made of alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Termalfurdö in J<0xC3><0xA1>szberény).
Many open swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city looks out over the roofed swimming pool in Zurich, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberb from the outdoor swimming pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: The <0xC3><0x96>tztal Water Cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steam rises in winter, while in the background the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people believe they have reached a sanitary toilet.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legame sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for beautiful bathing spots, when she wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she found herself with a blocked terrain.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white, and yellow modernist building, he saw the weeds growing among the tiles.
The decline countered in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction behind them; not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements from the times of its construction in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style Arab hall, added in 1900.
Since its meticulous modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is native to the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit merging different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the commodity business
by Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to one study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents say Deutsche Bank and other lenders are pulling out of the business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive up prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer campaign is directed specifically at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity betting was thought to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have been decoupled from offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than American competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business “deserves to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank.”
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be finalized by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank board, along with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank’s management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “Stakes at rising food prices show especially drastically how ruthless banks are currently harming the public welfare.”
Ackermann stands as the biggest banking lobbyist, especially in bonds.
“Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it stakes money for food price bets,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter if Ackermann is talking about starving people or the fame of Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned in the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation can perfect its image.
And you need to care little about possible losses, that's what your successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were bet.
Many customers of the bank showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
43 percent would discourage such a bank from their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
The 21st house in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and collapsed.
It now reopens as an exhibition house.
Modern post-Gerra architecture is passionate, clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its lightweight, floating construction of steel and glass.
Construction is still considered to be a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was erected after the universal exhibition in the Schweizer Garten next to the Vienna South Station, was reformed in 1962 and inside a 20th century museum was inaugurated, it was called the "20th house".
The building was adequate but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; no wall to hang art, no good atmosphere.
In spite of this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is decaying more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz refurbished the pavilion, now calls it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, has achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only did he significantly reform the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but also because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its move to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade windows was changed, a fiberglass-reinforced insulating glass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light descended between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in antique mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monuments office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office,” Krischanitz says and warns of rough flooring in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and light.
The "Brussels-born" pavilion has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the city's history".
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that’s why I wanted to “awaken the right awareness.”
In this case the 21st house is not in the wrong place, an urban stroke of luck has happened. The totally new and planned "central station district", with housing and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck: House 21 could receive a boost from another Krischanitz building, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall and, as you hear, negotiates with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn Plans a Winter Crisis Package of Millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid train breakdowns in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train failures and delays caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
For this, better availability of vehicles and of the railway network must be achieved even in extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, chairman of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train failures and delays this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered axle breakage at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in fines in the US
After the turmoil over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, Deutsche Bank has to pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million in a deal, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of mortgage bonds.
The financial market regulator NCUA blames many large banks for inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such bonds lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the matter without the parties having to go to court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
The NCUA seeks to repay the losses of millions incurred.
The agreements currently concluded are its first type.
The regulator had also called other major banks to account and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of dubious mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, it led to the perdition of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a tricky wind is currently blowing for U.S. banks.
Investors and the inspection have instituted countless processes to receive compensation or to punish faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most lawsuits.
It reproaches the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand from the FHFA, it deals with businesses worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to be held accountable for "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests heavily in the information technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology as the long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he’s read IBM’s trade report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the Information Technology primitive should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed on economy broadcaster CNBC that it has acquired shares of IBM worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has thus grown to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM knew nothing of the compromise so far.
He praised the leadership that dealt with ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long established lucrative information technology services as the operation of computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old IT pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion in a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
The Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 80 subsidiaries, as well as a number of large consortia such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname “Oraculus of Omaha.”
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s shares on the stock exchange rose one percent.
“The Blue Giant,” as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and ranks, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is reviving.
The murders of eight small-business tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, this news has been reacted with fear and concern.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was thought to be dead long ago has returned, since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence with a far-right background against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The ultra-rightist network uncovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Is bloody ideology coming back to life?", headlines the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The newspaper "Sabah" instead points out that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend recalled the victims of racist violence with a vigil outside the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act on the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary", says the headline of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcaster "Hürriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He points out that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
On the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities have not looked for suspects in the far-right circle much earlier.
Some are shown the less rhetorical about the drastic means: "From now on it is lost here, immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network," Selen writes.
Which means that, if Germany’s internal peace is in jeopardy, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen will clear up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks aggravate the group sentiment of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was then mainly criticized for the lack of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the Solingen arson attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks in Germany contribute to taxes.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media again shows how profound is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time frank words are needed.
The Bank of the Lake Zurich Scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
It is now run by a German.
Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit in July, it became known that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops kind remarks on his future teammates.
"USB has achieved a revitalization."
“I’m happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London evaded all of the bank’s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, general manager of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to attend.
The chairman of the USB board has since been equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber is expected to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank said Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and advisor and has had a period of adaptation surely necessary.
All of a sudden he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven itself to be the "biggest scandal bank in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also cunning, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
At $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s big banks.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: "In the eyes of my students, I have always qualified USB as a model of a good bank."
“From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?”
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it was revealed that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk bonds and had to amortize billions.
To charge for this, USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course that some looked with contempt until shortly before: an Asian, opaque state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard of.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, in 2006 in the second highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS found itself in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought troubled securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was affected, it was affirmed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of UBS’s balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland’s economic performance (see chart).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated to a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
The UBS more or less confessed to having helped in the tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich clients: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
In just a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: investment banking through erroneous speculation and asset management through aid to tax fraud.
And just when it got a little quieter again, just when it was thought that UBS was getting it again, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still does not work well with risk management in investment banking.
“The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: “The problem with UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls.”
So the idea arose of the precaution, with which the Swiss bankers had long presented themselves, to be the custodians of the greatest goods in the world: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli for authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a little bit older.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry stores like Tiffany<0x60>s among traditional Swiss businesses like Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have resided here for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse Palace, to elitist private banks such as Julius Bär.
You enter the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are lined with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bench there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both big banks.
UBS has become too big, he says, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the seven-million-dollar small country decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book "Der UBS-Crash."
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they come up with this?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served for the two different precursor banks of the UBS to complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a big financial bike.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, the modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who managed to make his way from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It’s clear: The folly came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
A few steps went well.
In forex trading and stock trading it was at the top.
However, the consultants of the companies in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of "fixed income" banking, there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine to securitize American mortgage loans and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks he sought the descent for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order turned out to be more complicated than they expected.
The seats at UBS have become projectable seats and are unsafe to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Bank expert Geiger has an idea, to end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking needs to decline a lot, it’s clear now.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank bank split surprisingly from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he prevailed: He must permanently run the UBS business, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Removes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is sure to ask himself at the moment.
So far, he only says that he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market
The impending recession in Europe has frightened U.S. investors at the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain without force.
The restrained industrial production in the continent stifles the hopes of stabilizing at its origin a crisis caused by indebtedness.
The general relief over the changes of government in Rome and Athens might not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has been half-full, not half-empty, but now the problems come back to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are listed on the sales list.
The Dow Jones Index of Standard Values closed down 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.

Companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat’s statistical office.
What created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We are not an island, if not dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do whatever it takes to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
That is why, from their point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws a decade of old principles overboard and enters the American tech sector.

Smart stakes spread in cities
In many places grates are considered "problem birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like it, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grajos have belonged to the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors for the trash and the noise of the animals accumulate.
Although no means have appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
Scratches no longer leave cities, experts say at the first symposium on Scratches in Leer, East Frisia.
There specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected fields; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end up with traditional living spaces.
The hunting, the growing construction and the fall of trees that host them make it difficult for birds to live.
The grates are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to mass-kill the district’s crooks jumped to negative headlines.
Critics have described the hunting of animals by bird traps and the killing with sticks as especially brutal.
"By expelling and driving them away normally, nothing is achieved," Werner Klöver, an urban planner and landscaper at Leer, said.
Shooting nests or throwing trees with water are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals deviate, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Chasing them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we don’t catch them anymore.”
Without the surroundings, the problem in the cities is not solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of chasing animals from sensitive residential areas and baiting them to settle elsewhere is possible.
"Information panels instead of chainsaws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against it in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a beak in the face with aplomb."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger grates teaching circuit in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on criticism of bird noise: "All are forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grates not only take advantage of the resources to access shale bits, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four grades how far the intelligence of birds goes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second rehearsal, the cunning grates had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they caught the bucket in the shooter of the tube.
Three of the four runners got it on the first try.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Euro 2012.

A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his scoring skills from afar and scored 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not show up in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the scorer Edin Dzeko.

Jiracek scored for Czech Republic
Then college student Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of Penati Bosnia, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark filed a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European runner-up cleared everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished with the last doubt in the 81st minute. with goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualified for the fifth time in a row for the European Championship.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) also had luck and had to overcome a reaction second in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal on Tomas Sivok's own goal (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the front lap, very right at Cech's goal.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the world-famous goalkeeper's spar, the FC Seoul striker escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentencing the match.
Meanwhile, Turkey wasted the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink would have to leave his bench seat at the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians celebrated their fourth participation in the European Championship final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks were almost getting a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. Attacker Kazim Kazim also could not send the ball inside the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia took more and more control.
After the break, Croatia did not let him score any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made way for Dortmund's Ivan Perisic, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionnaires of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who triumphed with 4-0 in the first leg prepared for a pre-decision, to the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the invited team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
From the first moment, the defender avoided possible advantage goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he got ahead of him.
After a defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, getting 1-0.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
SAP, Europe’s largest software maker, invests billions in China over the next few years and wants to nearly double its number of employees in the country.
Approximately two billion dollars (approximately 1.5 billion euros) will circulate by 2015, the dax consortium said on Tuesday.
"We will get more R&D facilities and hire workers," Bill McDermott, co-chair, said at a conference in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from 2,500 workers currently to 4,500.
The number of branches of the international market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s more than 176,000 international customers are headquartered in the country of the boom.
Growth plans in China are also an important element of the dax consortium’s 2012 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its sales volume by 2015 to 20 billion euros.
Last year it came in approximately 12.5 billion euros.
Currently the business of the software provider that employs 50,000 workers worldwide, is doing as well as rarely in the past.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“We currently want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott explained.
“Our goal is to activate lasting growth in China through broad instruction.”
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of World War I, “begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one’s soul fall to the feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently start this page and make it your branded pages.
He will get to know these people very well in the novelistic narrative of Mr. Englund, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he rightly describes as “a work of anti-history.”
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
The beauty and pain of battle combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go mad, or die.
Their lives flash here like lit votive candles in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund’s book is a departure from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench warfare on the Western front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" expertly moves through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an untreatable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, a Katrina hurricane that stinks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
“Factlessness,” Mr. Englund observes, “has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"The Beauty and Pain of Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained for the most part from memoirs, letters and other previously published material.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or poignant, but they are more full of life in Mr. Englund’s accumulation of small moments, lost details.
Many of these are about deprivation and coping with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl she says, "Substitutes, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into ram fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, he notes, "837 allowed meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive for savagery and states about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are conceived for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starchy and skewed peach."
Instead a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will find out or care.
“Once one resigns oneself to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly like “a convict being strangled in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” Mr. Englund writes, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in good-fashioned clothes who executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both noble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and soak their genitals in hopes of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often results in lifelong blindness.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war has “unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the Modern Memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like Sin noventa en la fronte by Erich Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Remarque, rather than integral stories.
Mr. Englund’s volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a nonfiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it’s as if he came from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault at the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen Monday night to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscored how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department.
Episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, breaking department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the "squatters."
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye facing Zuccotti.
Agents increased so-called disorder training — counter-terrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing large numbers of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park came at the “last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as “an exercise.”
“To the few cops I know who were called for this, they weren’t told it was to enter Zuccotti Park,” said the person, who spoke anonymously.
“The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department.”
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from across the city district — dozens of mobile agents who routinely flooded high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, such as those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to enter.
“It was appropriate to do it when there were the fewest people in the park,” he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with headlights and loudspeakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages resounding from the loudspeakers appeared to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply picked up their belongings and left.
No stores were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving demonstrators time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering at the perimeter to enter if arrests were to be made at the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many reporters said that attempts were made to prevent them from seeing police take action in the park, and that they had been brutally treated by officers.
Mr. Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the dense tangle of protesters’ personal belongings, including luggage and plastic and paper trash bags packed with clothes, Cleaning Department teams followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, images appearing on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of protesters took up positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to methodically arrest them.
Around 10 people at the camp’s epicenter were locked in their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services officers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made at the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for “impairment of public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the uniformed senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department’s chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not directing operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a series of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protester were hospitalized.
Union of support workers will sue the city for layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is arguably the last weapon available to the union in 37th Municipal District in its effort to overturn layoffs.
Sixty-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s lowest paid lost their jobs on Oct. 7, in a move that union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal last spring to allow the city access to a health care fund run by task forces to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council counterattacked, telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the school’s support staff members would be fired.
Officials in the 37th municipal district said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that he would be sued. A news conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city’s Department of Education as defendants, and features eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latina women, as well as most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and could therefore not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees as they had been chronically underfunded.
While there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.S. District 36’s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for every poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" most often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school payroll to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
“Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,” the complaint’s draft reads, “and not just in surplus.”
Mission over, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats on the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for the participation of the United States to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (D-Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent for Connecticut), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution is to honor the courageous Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It’s an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties quarreled with each other and with the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory — with Congress angry enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee’s resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience to liberate themselves” and “praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as the June bill did?
The latter version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar’s spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
Across the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far been unsuccessful in getting their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicate - the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate - and others with slight variations on each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that will “control federal spending.”
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors — especially novice Republicans looking to refine their resumes — the opportunity to brag that they were the “authors” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while Rep. Jose E. Serrano (New York Democrat) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one banning the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of states.
So enthusiastic that members have been when it comes to proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and submitted 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
Beaten but Not Beaten, Giffords Speaks in First TV Interview Since Shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot her at close range at a constituent act in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along with the Broadway tune “The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow” and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his ABC News appearance "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed walking help.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, passing from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he unexpectedly returned to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and described his recovery as “difficult.”
When asked by Sawyer how he feels, 41-year-old Giffords replied, “Very well.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special “20/20” show, which aired on the eve of the release of the couple’s new book, “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special program looked at Giffords’ recovery from the Jan. 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the early weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, her head shaved and a long scar running through her forehead.
She can only hold one or two fingers up while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head move.
A frown of the lips.
And then his first word: "What."
In a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toasted," a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that the music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
“A lot of people died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Tough, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
“You’ve just been beaten.
And you’re going to get out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to come back stronger than ever.”
Troops make you feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines stormed their posts around him.
The etiquette crowd stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
“They were shown as some sort of orphaned child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring, American public.
The troops are bestowed with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if they feel sorry for those in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity are conducted quietly and privately among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from combat with the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they confronted the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an “angry and violent veteran below the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to stand under the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling his children.
Military uneasiness arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that is unfamiliar with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise from politicians and the public largely focuses on the depth of a service member’s suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
Army Faces Increasing Pressure to End Rape
This week, a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded like an alarm signal,” Lyman says.
However, the Texas native put aside her concern.
I thought, no, she's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he alleges.
This week, on Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision at a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether their lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claiming they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or impart adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going to the army's main floor, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, you will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy — essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the military.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages sustained by active duty personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have been killed and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the army to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on “personality disorder” diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to give them discharge from the service – a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing her of discriminatory practices in the way she handles benefit claims for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been tabled in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense’s Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
However, the attacks are remarkably underreported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, it accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial – half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe his attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 different times to a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her aggressor – from a cut in her arm – was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "" That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment. ""
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was discharged from service on less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
As for whether the case filed by Lyman and his fellow plaintiffs continues, it’s a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn’t have the same incentive and deterrence that accountability poses.
And he adds, "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go its way, Burke, the plaintiffs’ attorney, will queue her other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place,” he says.
“Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 people dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook’s stockpile of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy — the way marketers have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s a whole new way of doing research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
“Those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
DEMOS’ work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in likes, wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is driving a research boom, boosting the number of academic papers with the site name in the title to nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach with a folder on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to poll people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook eliminates all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who talked about their drinking feats on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having problems with drinking than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and step in to help a student post too many status updates with their binge drinking.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
“We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed.”
Facebook is also constantly “pricking” its own population for data.
The site’s Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine’s Day, the expectation of voter turnout in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed – advocates of digital freedom have long argued that the site should make its vast amount of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is an open bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted with students’ public Facebook walls.
“As far as they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know what part of a user’s profile information and wall posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paperweight and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for getting into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about the social — and a lot of the social is still happening offline.”
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik Makes His First Public Appearance in Court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Knights Templar,” he told a packed room of 500 people.
“I am opposed to the court because it received the mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a speech written in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, barred him from media access for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhumane," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked the journalists and survivors in the eyes as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange notion of being part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge determined he is not a mentally ill, and said there is no evidence he acted with accomplices.
Some may be reassuring that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically soften the pain and confusion an entire nation still feels.
“I wish it looked like a monster, but it doesn’t look like it,” said a relative of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it seemed so."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview Shown at a Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in a recently rediscovered Jobs interview that has been dusted off as a preview of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of the products.
He was certainly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and flowchart junkie — a man who believed that many executives suffered from “a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
By that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively at his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the interview originals disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete copy was discovered on VHS in the director's garage.
This slightly reissued footage is the basis for Steve Jobs: The 68-minute Missing Interview, which hits the Landmark theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers – from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely’s questions, pushing him to go faster toward the more important topics or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
“Throughout the years in business, I always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers they invariably give you are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs details his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Disconcerted by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good coverage, and then adjusted with a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine trade costs in detail.
On the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he built himself with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a payphone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and yelling through the pay phone and going back a minute later to the pay phone next door,” Jobs says with a chuckle.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us didn’t know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the U.S. diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the pope himself was woken up to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched Bill Hewlett’s phone book and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode ray tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
She would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste her time with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Soon in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a client if he could assemble the whole team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments ... I was screaming that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On the big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s renaissance, Jobs prophetically foresaw how many industry leaders would stumble into his vision, and lose control of his market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers and printers, so what?"
You have a monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
The sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this class of people who end up leading companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as artistic expression:
“There’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can’t make electrons do, glass does, robots do, factories do.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end it all comes down to taste – it comes down to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has ever done, and then trying to adapt those things you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who casually were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health care law rivals while the court accepts the case
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept President Obama’s challenge to the health care law, two of his magistrates, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were given a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to allow the lawsuit to proceed and, in fact, a historic five-and-a-half-hour plea is expected by March, and the outcome will likely further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court’s decision becomes known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and claim the law must be scrapped will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health care bill.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they weren’t, they could be said to fall under Canon Code 4C, which says: “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related and other organizations, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia and Thomas’ absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This impressive breach of ethics and indifference to the code goes against the claims of several magistrates that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“The judges were entertained in a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they too easily mix the court’s activity with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’ wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Obama administration’s attorney general when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law to be impartial for now.
Kagan has given no indication that he will.
Boeing Receives Record Order of $18 Billion
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle jets, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is aircraft maker Boeing Co. and the selling price for the 50 planes rises to a record $18 billion.
It is as large as the place from which Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft for its dollar value - 50 double-aisle Boing 777 jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would bring the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel economy and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,” Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, they not only have the money to pay for planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the highest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money from the increase in the price of oil.
That’s important because they’re less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates’ order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps to keep at bay its competitor Airbus SAS’ attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing’s win at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which directly competes with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co’s shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n claims that drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the race for governor.
President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n during the violent state’s election, and she claimed Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the front in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for the entire country," Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
“They threatened our candidates, our election workers... They seized the ballot boxes, set up barricades... and ordered the people to vote” in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly overtaken Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, who had led the polls before the election.
Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, a candidate of his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the position of governor, came in third place, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left ahead of the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied ties to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and he chose Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and numerous candidates left local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n’s elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, for next year."
BASD urges Asia to help bail out eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avert a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two fastest-growing major economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the economic bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries observing Europe’s difficulties in an “impartial” way and said that Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avert a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
“So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune.”
“So if China and India can help, let it be by all means.”
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has heightened fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has prompted calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater bargaining power for Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said “India will do everything possible” to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depletion of foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where do we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India’s billion two hundred thousand people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will realize that Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that won’t go well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greece’s many well-paid public sector workers in jobs at poorly run, loss-making companies like the railways.
Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces “downside risks” due to Europe’s threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors, to Afghanistan’s battlefields, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Sens. John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said Congress’ failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called “kidnapping,” would result in 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects impossible to execute — you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building — and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
“We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to fire civilians in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the readiness.”
The cuts would eventually reach combat troops, Panetta said.
“While wartime funding in overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be adversely affected by serious disruptions in base budgets,” Panetta said.
“The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that supports the war.”
“The payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are strongly against this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta’s letter.
“This is not a result with which one can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to occur.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the senators’ recent warnings will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts is yet to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly candid about possible cuts, even though he came to work at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a grim picture of what might be ahead – an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an aerial wing without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries."
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how reductions “generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously engaged around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but supporters say it is the next vital step in improving and tackling potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “stuck” with an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself with his denials quickly rebutted by irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps on school and university exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given the exam responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and deceiving are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Detecting lies, or “locating lies,” is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the last six decades at prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been refuted.
Liars do look into the eyes.
They don’t always stutter, babble, blush or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and timing.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-oriented lies," while women tell more "self-oriented" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they often tell tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the subject’s usual behavior.
This is called “creating a baseline.”
It helps to provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
It’s best to know if someone normally kicks your foot all the time so you don’t make unfair accusations when you see your feet kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for deceptive, verbal, and nonverbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as warning signs, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat may freeze their upper body while trying to remember their story, may point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a “post-interview relief” — that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Often interrogators falsely make it appear that the interview is over only to seek that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson shook his foot to the bottom and used the time gone by while claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use distancing language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question in its entirety.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... even what I... to my understanding."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a wake-up call.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.

Controversial pipeline plan diverted following threat of U.S. delay in approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering unions while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit on a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until potential new routes are studied that avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast groundwater supply.
“This is a real path to progress,” Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year’s election, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed their full support.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have opted for an estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada’s hired lobbyist, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the show.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that disco music diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrorizing her young daughter to the point that she vomited out of fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's diatribe frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when trainee Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up from behind and said, 'You know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'yes,' and I went to get her,'" she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, 'I shouldn't have left your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
“I said, ‘I have no interest in what you say or think.’
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
I had a bottle of water and started throwing the water from the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,'" the girl's mother said.
LaBelle jumped at the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and pulled back to a car waiting for her, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so loud she vomited, he added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it can get to a cancer-supporting association.
“The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when addressing a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, in Sinaloa, unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy has contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, self-denominated change, which generated great expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity at the beginning of the year, there is no growth, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the chances of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost damage, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage in 582,835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The drop in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment in the state during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloa were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter of the year.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out from public policy.
“What we are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a restriction of resources by legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who take dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Detained migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already have many difficulties in finding work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Informal
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is aggravated by the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being listed as a worker before any social security institution.
Along with unemployment and informality, another of the state’s job lags are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to records from the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
Together with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there is the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June of the state FDI added 630,697 dollars, representing a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 312 dollars recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Faced with the scenario of economic contraction, the state government in July requested the state congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be destined for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to revive the economy, the approval of the local congress was in the amount of 2,600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés’ government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensely to recover the ground we lost in this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, failed to align the effort of everyone and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year halted the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
“The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations that we had,” he mentioned.
Redefining Vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to channel the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to be done
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better guides the Government’s efforts.
"In general terms I would say that the government has been striving to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way it conducts public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He was convicted of eight kilograms of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General’s Office reported that the convicted drug addict is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army, on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narco-nudist was driving in a white pickup truck, carrying a black bag in the box of the vehicle and in the co-driver’s seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured remained at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person remains interned in the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
You must contribute to the works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although so far the construction programs have advanced, they are at risk because the State Government has not complied with the contributions that correspond to them, which amount to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State is responsible for 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these becomes effective.
"There are almost 12 million that they have to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part," he said, "we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute on that occasion.
"It happened to us in the previous six years because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State left pending," he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them arrive as soon as possible.
“There are almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth.”
Corte validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, not meeting the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers in issuing the decree that details the actions to be followed to concrete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
In favor of the project only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero herself voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not consider that if it did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate, the rectorship of the State.
The replacement of analogue by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing change, he said, would delay the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision in the public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, “require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the State’s economic stewardship, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the sphere of competence of the Congress, as it is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative, he said.
They analyze the possibility of a count "vote by vote" in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
According to the data released by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor’s election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total 6,74 minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of this year's electoral process in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where according to data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total acts.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be remembered, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal term so that they could enter into force in the current electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines provided in the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that some
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislative power and called the vote of the state president on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal", since he has no right to "sanctify or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may take place in the event that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and counting in the file of the box or does not open in the possession of the president of the same; or, when there are errors or obvious alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the election in question and the one who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that applied for the second of the nominated candidates.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the ordinary count it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second-placed, in which case electoral packages that have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, during Monday, reconnaissance and a requiem mass were held.
According to his relatives, the lieutenant colonel’s last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.

His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, like the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".

Three bodies found abandoned on Cadereyta farm NL
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, on an abandoned estate in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery took place at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place observed that in the fifth, whose bard is beige with coffee, was the open gate wide open.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately notified the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow t-shirt with dark denim trousers, without shoes; next to him was another with a white strap t-shirt.
A metre away was another individual’s body in a red t-shirt and blue denim pants.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with Italy's president to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with Italy's president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, though it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present the president with the outcome of his talks with political parties in his bid to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former EU commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The “framework is now well delineated,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, as Italy grapples with a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former EU commissioner Monti must pass a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain stricken confidence in Italy.
Underscoring pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets put the yield of Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employers' group Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were considerably boosted by the backing of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the majority technocrat government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
On Monday, Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women’s organizations.
He will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite late last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would step down, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before moving the election forward.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be made up only of technicians, an indication of his concerns about a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The Spaniards are superior to the Ticos.
Of the 22 footballers named from Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 candidates reached the 50 games.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 convened by both countries for the friendly today, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, number one on the FIFA monthly rankings, account for an extensive record of Class A interselection games, Tricolor only owns defender Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
That figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
The Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense yearly activity in league championships and domestic cup, and high-level clashes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To this is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers of the European Championship and the World Cup.
Tico footballers, on the other hand, have limited international friction in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish team is the goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationals.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, Barcelona’s brain flyer, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA together with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the ram of Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Almost close to the hundred-year-old figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and close to Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a, are the left-back Junior D<0xC3><0xAD>az, with 48 presences and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var owns only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain's historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 targets, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records more with nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on its two-decade-long celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been more than 20 years waiting, but the band assures that for them also will make reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was confirmed by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour and will make its only stopover in Central America on Sunday.
On that day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with the angelina band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is in The Nation on the Internet.
For their Costa Rican fans, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we’ll be able to stay there for a few days.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What do they say to their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the last 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that puts us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this all about?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and so I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined we’d be in a big rock band and having done it for over 20 years ago makes it sound like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We’re lucky to go to places in the world we’ve always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with all of them still and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we’re all lucky to still be alive and second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too touring because it’s easy to fall into that game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you have to respect the music and what brought it, without becoming infatuated with being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote really good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration because it would last so long and the most important thing is that we are still very close friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do Yellow Ledbetter lyrics always change live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fad?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the bands that came up at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s a wonderful thing because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that might seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs undoubtedly represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his GP said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a tongue cancer for which he has been operated on four times and remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he knows himself innocent.
He was operated on four times from cancer to the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies have been added such as severe erosive gastritis, the cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, arterial hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been incarcerated in the National Directorate of Special Operations since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official entourage, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proper for the exchange of information in all that are the political affairs between the two nations," as published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay’s rejection and the call for consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group made up of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to exit the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) "grey list", made up of countries that have not implemented all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustache plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled tirelessly over the course of 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's head of specialized press in Spain, Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez noted that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for that support", as hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson has maintained that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once exceeded, the more experienced will be able to give a "second turn" to the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winks to fans of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous installments, consisting in that the plumber of the mustache will have to travel mined platforms of danger in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a Luigi "playable".
Colom backs Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he had arranged the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and executive powers, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
He said that during his tenure he "did not get his hands on" court rulings and processed all extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, will be extradited.
What Colom has done is an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional instances had been exhausted to prosecute the former president between 2000 and 2004.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the fall in marginalization of uneducated children
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
To this is added the hundred long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock of an event held in the former factory complex of Fabra i Coats which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogration or in situation of falling into marginalization.
The celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former Socialist Education Councillor, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current ecosocialist councilor Ricard Gom<0xC3><0xA0>.
The current minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the grand hall of the Fabra i Coats.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example for fighting bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Evicted a squatted farm where macrofiestas were made
The invaders had taken possession of 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51.
The 12 occupants left the farm yesterday noon without resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday’s noon the building they illegally occupied, and where they organized macrofiestas that despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from being repeated.
"From now on there will be an access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building -the rest are inhabited-, took all the electrical installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowded parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the invaders of the estate made unfair competition, since they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure space had had to respond to neighborhood complaints about noise, while, she said, the annoyances were not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the squatted house and, above all, by those attending the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago she "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city council, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had demanded last week "immediately evict the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but during the last months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and in some there have even been robberies.
In this sense, he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivism that has been generated on the farm".
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police headed to 35 rue de Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people entering the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies about fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional pasquins of Collserola.
The pamphlet defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again placed, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but above (mountain) -below (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these were until, in September, the city council called a megacompetition composed of 16 contests for as many doors to access Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put doors to the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it supposes of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It’s almost a recurring theme to be grasped when two members of this ancient caste of elect recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, have presented themselves.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel M<0xC3><0xB2>dol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after approaching the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to debate about "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerd<0xC3><0xA0>, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is possible to start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title "gates of Collserola" encloses a "lexical trap": you should not think of them "as accesses to a park, but the delimitation of areas where you have to act."
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers arising from the "uncertainty that is today projecting public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
“To limit something is to set the next step,” that is, its overtaking.
“We have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can give rise to real disasters.”
More closely related to the question, M<0xC3><0xB2>dol thinks that, by simplifying, the Valais side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", for a mere topographical issue.
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat of Collserola that "should not fall into a broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city offers his guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right", he points out) that have had to be created: "Architects should be just a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest a global vision of Collserola is lacking: "16 cross-sectional contests have been called -he says- in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, yes, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that would effect a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino Forgives Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and Will Be Free
After 72 days of entrenchment, the legal representative of Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that followed him for alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which follows a blackmail process against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, made public a series of photographs and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s demanded the payment of an economic fee for the regional municipality to allow the clandestine operation of the bookmaker.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panista mayor and on 2 September he was arrested and taken into custody for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Roots 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days after a second ground order was issued after the prosecutor's office dismissed bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with 1.5 million pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial interned in the municipal cells of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On October 25, he was given an arrest warrant by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who said that almost two months of investigations proved enough evidence to determine Jonah’s guilt, such as the charge of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
On Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, went to Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the regional mayor; so that in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the public prosecutor attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez if the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and henceforth no claim can be made about the process that followed him; in addition, no compensation for damage or punishment will be required.
After the hearing to the legal representative of the bookmaker, about 15:50, Larrazabal Breton was ordered immediately released.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, moved to the jail of the municipality of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come gives details of the plane crash in which the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees 25 meters away where the unit lost its fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that research done in the impact area does not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search, there are no parts or components of the spacecraft elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
“The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to carry passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation can last several months, even up to a year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter operated at cruising speed and that this happened on soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was conducted under the rules of visual flight, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM located suitable conditions for take-off, as the aircraft progressed towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of cloudiness at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew has sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and sideways trajectory.
The pattern of dispersal of aircraft debris makes it possible to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion was detected:
At the site of the accident there is still no evidence of any kind of explosion or fire in the remains of the ship.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During fieldwork parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above average sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disarticulated along that path.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search over a wider area than the cordoned site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Social Security Leads Research to Discover the Obesity Gene in Children and Youth; Supported by IPN Specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is leading research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity', which will allow to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the participation of the population, whether or not they have the right, to go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out on minors, every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He stressed that the protocol began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Mexico State West) and that since October 8, the activity has been carried out at the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Unit (Mexico State East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day is celebrated on 14 November, she said the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on nutrition.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics are applied to all participants (we seek to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
"The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight there was also a dramatic rise," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for the markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they are overweight or obese.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of you suffering from metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors hand it in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV for most of the day and using means of transportation instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, that is, the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics that are analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would prevent potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a blend with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 bumps each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is even adequate, the bumps could be reduced in quantity.
In his lecture A Technological Opinion of the Hollows, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory in charge develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, near 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that on the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warned the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt binder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
By passing through the vehicles and generating efforts, this allows the forces to diffuse very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer opined.
On the asphalt binder, it abounded, a last layer called rolling binder is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt binder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the treadmill also requires having the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt binder.
When the soil gets wet, the water diffuses inside the folder and is difficult to leave, this causes softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a bump, he said, the first to wear is the bearing film and only after that the asphalt binder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed at the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is complied with, to avoid that bumps form frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair potholes easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate from the Valley lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not to reach the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of Princess.
Once again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire for the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico rose with the crown and the scepter (1989), Diana M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>rquina M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>nina M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s<0xC3><0xA1>s M<0xC3><0xA1>s
The big question many people are asking today is what is missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury made to designate her First Princess is that it did not convince with its answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, of the Literary Cart Leamos.
To the interrogator the Caucasian valley replied:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way of culturalizing, I definitely think the book that marked me as a child is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment", it is a universal book of literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
A response that he did not like first for the term "culturalize" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses put forward, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> suggested that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who won all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best handmade costume, and Reina Madre), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage".
And that was noticed in his first swimsuit presentation at the Hilton Beach and his two parades at the coronation evening.
Although he looked confident in both, it was noted that he lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN’s “Como en casa” program, said the fact that Melina was named princess “checks that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest does not remain queen.”
In addition, Valle was very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For something, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects,” he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the back and the fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens trainer Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, which the truth for me was not very noticeable, dropped points on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the Vallecaucana was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
His body was never his forte and here he was charged.”
For this prize, which for the first time presents the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel prediction emerged that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contention that Raymundo granted to Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Contest itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her sweeping passage through Cartagena, was dodging the crown.
This was the work of the cale<0xC3><0xB1>o who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lophoscopist from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC chief: "Alfonso Cano", through the matching of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists who work in the CTI sectional, that week it was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in municipalities of the Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to stay for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the corpses that had to be identified were.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of the friction skin, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar was warned to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being from the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to bring Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz’s decadactyl card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was, he did not recognize it for its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much thinner.
But the footprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that he was the top head of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a typist from the Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at the press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the people captured.
When caught, many criminals present false ballots or have no papers.
We take the fingerprints and search the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to make a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts,” he recalled.
Footprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a family member could be a suspect in the crime and, indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI typist explained that in objects “the fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents.”
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI TV show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective matching is performed.
'Indignados' challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday as they tried to enter again, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square from where they were evicted early in the morning and as they tried to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were crowding in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the "indignados" to recamp there, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square again, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the “outraged” to the eviction of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignados" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved to show support for the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a privately owned precinct, remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday in which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analyzed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and handed out copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the guards guarding the square, prompting "some small clashes," said Bray, who denounced that some officers struck the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing “laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to resettle with tents and sleeping bags.
The councillor personally defended the early-morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people," as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
“The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that in the Bloomberg fund he is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers,” the movement’s spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “lacking respect for freedom of expression.”
“Occupy Wall Street” officials also said they plan to organize “big actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen’s assistant on “Home Improvement,” rescuer on “Baywatch,” bunny on “Playboy,” the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" (Ballist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a pornographic home video in which she appears along with her then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as host in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the Christmas special of CTV features the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a slut during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of declines that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates by the Tokyo government put the material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the gross domestic product data between July and September served to turn the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - is also the fastest pace of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the resumption of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructures, to use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable escalated by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "safe haven values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts of the US, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the yen price.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government does not let down its guard.
"We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the secretary of state for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the world economy highlighted that major powers are slowing down.
It dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone, even, was below the average, which is at the 100 level, with eight tenths falling to 99.13 points.
Athens once again fuels doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives won’t sign any written compromise
With peripheral risk premiums soaring and uncertainty re-installed in the parquets, Greece continues to tangle in the maze leading to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said at the opening of a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the civil servants’ disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear up doubts about his stance: “We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the $8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his go-ahead to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still struck by the impact caused by the Papandreou referendum order, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment unambiguously and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay for the sixth tranche" of $8 billion, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek skewer still has thread for a while.
Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "predominant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place worldwide in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a recalled yesterday that the country has become in these last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" she said lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with a horizon of 2015, and, "especially, in the one that aims to reduce by half the volume of people living with incomes lower than the "daily dollar".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate in the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are “many achievements” and “many challenges we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is intended not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is aspired that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will rise above the poverty threshold in which they are submerged.
The impetus in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a emphasizes as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know on the ground her lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all of them I have been able to see the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the title of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "coach of the poor".
Finally, Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this sense, he explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to periods of economic prosperity, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said that microcredits are “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty”, and now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to the people "excluded who all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who consider that the government’s policy is currently too loose with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and 10 abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes won, with her speeches, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe assumes peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to make way in Europe."
This could be manifested in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to allow for stronger European Union control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "face Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly Wolfgang Schäuble's idea.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country under the European Central Bank directive against the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce Germany's weight.
Eager to calm the mood within her party, the Chancellor has increased her references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither has she tried to win her congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except in passing.
Recalling that two centuries ago there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and deliver a speech on the topic, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the will to save rigorously, but still reminds of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
Firstly, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of absence on private sector workers before they can be discharged.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing on officials a day of absence without pay in case of unemployment (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority also puts the issue of fraud back on the table, this time oriented towards the abuses of work-leaving.
"The controls are going to increase considerably and, in addition, if someone is found committing fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned speaking in the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of unemployment fraud.
In fact, this issue has been constantly monitored since 2002, and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have usually paid off.
The French do not get sick more than in the rest of Europe.
First of all, let us look carefully at the national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), more than €237 million in unemployment benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, casualty subsidies accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity and work-related accidents, while 54% is related to sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6.2 billion euros.
Therefore, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, up from 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, compared to 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in 13 per cent of the 285,000 inspections carried out, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were "duely adapted or unjustified; a figure that, with a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
Undoubtedly, a negligible figure compared, for example, to work in black.
According to the MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9,000 and 15 billion euros per year, that is, more than the total cost of the subsidies for casualties and, undoubtedly, considerably more than the fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to straighten out its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared on Monday, 14 November, before Parliament; he also added that the 100 days that have been granted to his government of union would not be enough to achieve this objective.
“To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budget adjustment,” said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions adopted during the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, since "it is at stake" the country's stay in the euro area, he added.
As a result, Papadémos has forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favor of new measures," he said during a meeting with deputies of his party "New Democracy."
He said he agreed with the goals of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as fighting waste, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties’ support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
Experts say euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalised
Canadians Live Denying Death, Royal Canadian Society Report Says
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and physicians to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code so that assisted suicide and euthanasia are allowed, when the patient raises such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.”
With or without medication, 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And while most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
“In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal.”
“In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Eighty-five percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
Regarding the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, the authors of the report say.
In addition, among their recommendations, they suggest that the Penal Code indicates that the withdrawal of health care, if it has been legally refused, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that healthcare professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses care at the end of his or her life without fear of facing a complaint.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and physicians to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee calls for it to be considered as euthanasia and undergo the same procedures unless it serves to reduce physical pain.
Other experts expressed reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the position of the experts who sign the report "extreme", among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and over 18 can ask for help in committing suicide,” said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value in society.
However, he adds that “in society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called a “pro-euthanasia manifesto.”
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, calls into question especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President El Assad to Quit Power
Damascus denounces "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad’s supporters demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Diplomatic pressure has intensified on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a “plot” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, have spoken out in favor of President Assad’s abandonment of power.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
“If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the king of Jordan, Syria’s neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
The head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has lamented that Turkey’s mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country on which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already been killed in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, the NGO said.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country was "progressing towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damasco from office, which in its view constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not falter,” he added, guaranteeing that “the plots plotted against Syria will fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which he believes is locked in “paranoia.”
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the plan for exiting the crisis adopted on 2 November, which includes, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities held by the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Arab League's decision was "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to exit the crisis, although it did not express support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time from the markets to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with political parties and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a broad program with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has stated that he hopes that Mario Monti will request before Friday a vote of confidence in the Parliament to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, certainly of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its program, he stressed, adding that he is "sure that the markets will be patient and will understand".
His appointment by the President initially garnered market approval, but later uneasiness prevailed, particularly after an unforeseen fall in industrial output in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should operate until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence of the Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work taking into account the urgency and with the aim of Italy "regaining its prominence" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: "Even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new rigorous measures.
The head of the Italian "bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him mate, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot meet the requirements in terms of deficit".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "period change" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconismo"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to put about 200 billion euros in government bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA said last week it was "gravely concerned" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Later, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are “clear indications that Iran is developing” a “nuclear detonation system” with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as one member state has reported to the Agency, worked for most of his career on such technology in his home country’s military nuclear program.
Crimes and offences against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while, over the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49 per cent, compared to a 13 per cent increase in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall 14 per cent increase in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has risen slightly to 6,628, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“Following a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and crimes have increased again,” Human Rights First said in a statement, adding that “the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a senior official at Human Rights First.
"The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses," he said, adding that such efforts could include improved police reporting on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of the civil rights struggle.
The legislation was adopted following the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another called "name" allow you to more legibly and lively follow the activity of other "Twitters", that is, of those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This makes it possible to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they rate a message as a favorite, etc.
Twitter's new formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its poco instinctivo, con termes slightly esotericos (RT to resend a message from another person, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the net, users have debated with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” writes <0x40>jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed,” writes <0x40>dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "golden rule" in the Constitution
The ruling Christian Democrat/Social Democratic grand coalition government in Austria on Tuesday decided to include a budgetary “golden rule” in the constitution to reduce the public deficit and thus prevent a possible degradation of Austria’s sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were reduced by a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional 3 billion euros in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, the Christian Democratic vice-chancellor for foreign affairs.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the member countries of the euro area of last October 26: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with equivalent value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Before 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states, as well as the communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, the public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would step in again to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the all-time highs that produced the intervention of the Japanese authorities on October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been gradually rising since then, driven by purchases from investors who consider it a “safe haven value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar traded again on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic 105-yen bar, reaching levels close to those that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago, since it makes products made in Japan more expensive and reduces the value of income earned abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern Tohoku region, said Noda, who fears the yen's rise will cut the weak recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent over the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption by households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuance institute increased by five trillion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasury Letters, bringing to 55 trillion yen (519,000 million euros) the threshold of funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the guys grow, the bags falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as improved growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro area, European stock exchanges plunged further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 o’clock, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and stood at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Taking into account the new tensions in relation to the yields on loans from the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to yield part of their recent gains.”
“Anxious investors are well aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a 0.7% drop, renewing the concerns of market participants regarding Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes fixed on Europe and the exchanges will continue to take place on a reduced margin of variation, so that investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilized,” Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, said in a statement.
The re-emergence of worries about the future of the euro zone affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, which met Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds with the same term offered 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the southern countries, but also France, continue to fuel the concerns of the auditors.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has affirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his Government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The spread difference between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for growth figures for the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a more favourable figure than the 0.3% forecast, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
Moreover, the fourth quarter is what really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts are worth more than dogmas.
If there is one issue that cannot be addressed by considering short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting should be the time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will mean a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity must be alleviated, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany stands alone in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case either in Belgium, which is subjecting its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or in Switzerland, which is only intended to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, are moving forward with their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such a discourse.
The choice of Berlin will mean an increase in the price of electricity, a greater dependence on energy due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
Europe’s wind champion, who gets 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would subtract realism from the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not manifest opposition in principle to this type of energy, according to the polls.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs that specialize in international markets and can create non-localizable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of much of those SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a Security Authority which exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it had no consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to reactor design and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these advances and cooperation between the safety authorities, and French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is being studied by all the electric players who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subjected to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac fixed the orientation by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has nearly two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a crowd of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his programme, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande confines himself to including trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve the “problem of migration”.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally profitable, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent paper summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and hurts jobs.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pushing for wage cuts.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are rather complementary than substitutes for domestic workers and mainly work in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive influence on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Given the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows means a rise in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of €150,000 to the public budgets on average throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go and look for the growth points that he lacked "with his teeth".
Those teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this since, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote as directly as possible.
We know, since Napoleon the Little, that it was something thought out.
Universal suffrage, while a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and may even become an “instrument of oppression,” as the former republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to turn into a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence needs to be addressed in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature on the absolute European monarch or a vacuum stop of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take effect, but a common, full-fledged, calm and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that bows to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, the one that suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But to think about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new stalemate.
We must take on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
An interest-driven revolution would not suffice.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "contactless" chips are generalized
The world show of chip cards starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases by simply bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to continue to grow in 2012 (580 million units) and account for about 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large areas work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To put the upper gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two large French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminating bank cards equipped with the contactless system among their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile phone payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, indispensable to carry out transactions.
“They are lagging behind.”
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide,” said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay contactless through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, about which it has long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already “has certainty.”
“The way both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating,” he said, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the runways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the debris of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The study of the calls made points to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly caught the researchers’ interest: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but we must certainly wait until we have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such “supports” had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and of the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since pressed Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group as an uninteresting enlightened community.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), calls for the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants launch themselves into the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are oriented primarily to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks against police stations multiplied.
Abuya’s reaction was, as it usually happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested while alive, is killed in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist hub in Africa, which would range from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is troubling for all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making increasingly loud statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a stronghold of Republicans.
The often unfounded slogans spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for nomination by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulating their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that means the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that “overwhelms” emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the surveys, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I will stop Iran,” he boasted.
“If Obama gets re-elected, they’ll have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, shows embarrassing ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing “attempts to develop nuclear capability,” seemingly ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an aficionado and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But attacks are not easy for them.
People are judging Obama’s national security balance, which ended with bin Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he is wary of the military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that it takes economic reconstruction of America to resurrect his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia via the Baltic Sea bottom, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly communicates, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network together.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive in Western Europe each year through a first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipe is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 that will supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk about the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the overland passage by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
All of a sudden, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be harder to influence Russia by threatening to shut it off from Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has achieved greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe’s energy, given that the project has generated a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large consumers of gas and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically unites us,” Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon confirmed during the pipeline’s inauguration, demonstrating the extent to which large gas sector contracts are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the Gazprom executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, measures to protect the fauna and flora had to be extended.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in the waters of Sweden, but those responsible for the project renounced it, seeing that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state-owned company to settle permanently at sea off its coast.
“In the event of a breakdown, we will interrupt the gas flow in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, as they have foreseen joints that, according to forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is guaranteed by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is inserted into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is simply guaranteed by the pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and at the output of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch company Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company, for a period of 25 years, all of its renewable gas transport capacity.
“Gazprom will pay you for the full capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually being transported,” Müller said.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been carried out in 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and in 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom bears the risk of the expenses on its own.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a trademark notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back a taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a design notebook, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company’s consultant, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the stools.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century, to current taste,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Modo Modo.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed, has remained far away.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer’s profile, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its beginnings, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and has known how to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, diaries, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disheartening?
“No,” says <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable.
“At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a lot to do."
It is worth mentioning that the unemployed with disabilities continue to face numerous obstacles to accessing employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In other words, there are numerous issues that make it particularly difficult to return to work and that "constitute the crux of the problem," says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of the people advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité noted that the directors surveyed have “a low level of knowledge about disabilities”, with an “excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled”.
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law of 1987.
According to the latest figures available, dating from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body in charge of collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created a great deal of pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees, compared to 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure generated by this friendly match.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker’s grudge against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
“I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and because he is Belgian.”
“I want to move forward,” Lille’s striker replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations on his team and in the selection, "it's a set", it has been justified.
“In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
“I have to sit down.”
Summoned to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Not to mention the “pleasure”.
He has been cheering on the Bleus since he was seven, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
Without a doubt, this will especially reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face “Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),” he recalls.
“We just faced off recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to “pride.”
"Proud" to play "a gala game."
"Proud" also to see, as "neighbor", that France "returns to be a very high level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to share a plane with the Bleus to Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing up,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You'll be able to see him in the next games." Including the game against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal face with great optimism the return match against Bosnia (22:00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first game, both teams lacked realism.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubts; the Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao, which he has led since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a match to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Considering the one-way match (0-0) on Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given it peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored outside the house."
But at home, in the luminous Estadio de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal ", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the match will be very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012", said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a tie, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we have not scored outside the house," Bento laments.
“We are going to play against a team that has great technical quality and that has players with great individual quality,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to think".
A good idea, as long as it’s realistic this time around.
