Triumph of the populist right in Austria, together make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, a appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the party of the populist right.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of votes, so it loses 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections of 2006.
Worse still has finished the OVP losing 25.6 percent, nearly nine percent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the postwar period and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, deputy chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved as early as Monday at the party’s exceptional presidency meeting.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the vote - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would happen again in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 the BZ fell apart).
For this evolution, Haider clearly bets who already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach the parliament although it has slightly lost and dropped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the four percent limit and is therefore not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles is not solved, it could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York, after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this is not solved then yes, then it would certainly come to this cooling," he said after the meeting, which was organized on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was exempt from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“Their problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
Afterwards, he can request the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises appealing to the High Court and then pardoning would be possible," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convict “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already obtained by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, she insisted to her colleague that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
“We really consider it a shaky mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister evaded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would take care of the matter.
“I’ve received a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech arbitrates a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, on it is depicted Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its chief, director of the Division, Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed hides to this day a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
Petroleum and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to date that themselves hold the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the land
The coastal countries have today begun to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called Continental Rim which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Rim.
"Simply, by continental border is meant the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent underwater.
It reaches to the edge of the sea coast, and often to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Continent, must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on investigations and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of job preparation.
“One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist aid commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have moved forward," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a worldwide repercussion as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominance.
However, New Zealand also got it — the seafloor surface that the commission awarded it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, or nearly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars for their study.
The profit that will be derived from the use of the seabed will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other states are also slowly submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Where the Continental Rim ends, begins the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity".
No nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
“The seabed, however, is no gold mine,” director Mikulka says emphatically, adding “that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime contract-defined.”
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors like a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the Clarion Clipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The background there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
“An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” added Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of such concreteness.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the German special forces command was in the place of action
To resolve the hostage crisis, Egypt’s government had asked for Germany’s help – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue action.
Therefore in the place of release were specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokesmen reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The government of Egypt accepted the help of Germany to use it as support on the spot.
“Fortunately, that moment did not come,” said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as her 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the safe and sound people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
Initially in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return by Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Not Approving Salvation Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress narrowly failed a huge $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s package to save financial markets with 227 votes to 206.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, he did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action the desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the huge $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked MPs to vote, although the plan is not as popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investor concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order to allow the program to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened conjuncture the desire to travel of the Germans remains as before.
As the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the market research institute GfK, reservations for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent higher compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed on the reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar, especially trips to the United States are in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destination points of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Above all, organized trips are highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months travel was well booked, so the volume of sales compared to last year rose again - although according to another study the number of Germans taking a trip, compared to last year, fell.
My first Oktoberfest
The party hits under the open sky in the endless Spa, beer in one-litre jars and famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a custom traditional Bavarian costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: as soon as we are in the tent, the photographers already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with photos - it is very flattering especially because I am first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in traditional Bavarian costumes until this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for that much.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seems to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A Munich woman draws my attention to my apron which I had dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is widowed."
Oh God, now I'm clinging to my back to the left.
“Okay,” he says laughing.
The others don't care much about the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps that say "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, he is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
He looks like "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
She tells me after she puts her glass of a liter of beer she just drank next to it.
He put it right next to the fire hydrant, most people think that's a trash can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
Others aren’t very lucky and can’t consume as much alcohol.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, the sanitary groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear every time in a group - suddenly they are always four people who bring the covered platforms from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They arrive sober, they return drunk.
You can’t see who suffers from alcohol levels and is on the bends.
“They’re the ones who ‘can’t do it anymore,’” a sanitary man answered my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Victim of accident identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in the city of Brentwood, was implicated in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the crash, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey intended to be a member of the European Union, the European powers had a desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set at the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the vaulted box office was over, there was no doubt about the greatness of the company that this was the westernmost door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under
British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then the station has been falling apart and has remained on the sidelines of history.
But today, this railway, gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new collaboration policy.
The Turkish government has excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed on a bunk bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert on foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shakings, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, designed to govern a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has raised some suspicions in the West, and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "power patisseries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The objective of the party’s foreign policy is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today it has to look at the same time to the East and the West.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
“But surely at some point,” I ask, “could Turkey be forced to choose?”
“Turkey,” he replies, “doesn’t want to stand up to that choice.”
He then underlines a point that almost everyone I have spoken to up to that point had recited to me almost by heart: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those rail lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again at the station of Hydarpasha, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts turn to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How much would they have been surprised to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, for the most part, would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt in which continent this fascinating country should claim.
Lives to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (screening, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for those under the age of 21, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were ending our 20s — we just refused to give up on the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the changing mythological being of forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or Messiaen, indifferently if unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
You just have to sing!”
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never imposing, nor too flowery.
Whatever the musical skirmish, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never, by any, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I’ve been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two horses of war well known throughout the world."
We'll miss him so much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25) you state that "in 1946 he resumed his studies of economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he won a research fellowship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's, a master's and a doctoral degree."
This is learned from a note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a hop-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention for their simplicity and for the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second round for Honda bestseller
In November Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz.
If its predecessor already had ample habitability, this new minivan presents an even larger interior space.
To all this are added refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and allow saving more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model it is necessary to comment that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter term than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less well known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, where the Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz will allow to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a growth of 17% in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand managers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to market nearly 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned for the first months of the year, once it is presented in partnership in January in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its dimensions.
Its length goes up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase up to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the boot - which has a double bottom system - rises to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity than the boot of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the 1.4 engine, since the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will have two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre mechanic gets a power output of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 revolutions.
This engine - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
As for the previous propeller, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now it has 100.
This 100-horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The ‘bee car’ that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, specifically, bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an expansion of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles Nissan’s Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is the bee’s compound eyes, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly uninterrupted within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately results in collision prevention.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at right angles or greater to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and principal engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allow it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require storing information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can run continuously with just a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about memory gigas, not even megas.”
This is the first step in developing new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology Nissan is predicting will be introduced in production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles along the way.
Tiemble Before Mortgage
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of fluid to make injections, is not devoid of ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created an entertaining and informative game for the navigator: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the Hotel of bad credits... or messes.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, twice and up to three times if it is time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It certainly has useful information, but little detail.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because to buy a better house we don't even talk about...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock price.
A week after discovering an interim deal, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley common stock at a unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global transaction would be carried out on the basis of a unit price of $29, or 28% above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley was down 6.79% at $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a banking holding company,” said Juan Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to behave much more cautiously than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: on Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for almost $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, “we thought that the stake would have been composed only of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley bonds 7% below their carrying amount.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into common shares within a year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or so, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley says the capital contributed by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined to comment on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had greatly eased its balance since late August.
The last few weeks were tiring for the group, which saw its stock price fall by half while the cost of security against a risk of defaults on its debt took off.
This cost fell last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the other sole “survivor” of the big Wall Street investment banks after the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers bankruptcies and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, after the example of his colleagues and friends, he is the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted “yes” to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" received 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted outside the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a wide-ranging “yes” victory, estimating it to be between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The “Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly”, he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who lead the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, to be held in complete calm, according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observer mission, referred to a 444-point text consolidating the " new socialism " advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution entailed increasing the State ' s power over the economy, reserving it the " development planning " of a country that lived essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the head of state, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and would seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 people kidnapped have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good upon their arrival at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the hijackers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown hijackers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since gone from one zulo to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptus, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of shots occurred, and they killed half of the kidnappers, the others have fled," said this official who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"It must be acknowledged that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our secret service men, the special forces," he said without going into detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an SUV on board which the kidnappers were on, killing six, including the Chadian chief and detaining two.
He also stated that they were related to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), an assertion immediately denied by this group.
Lyrics - Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and occupies the current electoral campaign.
It's better this way.
But one part of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that starve to death?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore it only the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 historical, heritage, archival and genealogical societies are concerned to search history, preserve with little money piles of private archives and preserve archaeological remains.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and desperation when promoters and managers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of Fortis Bank.
The States of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization to the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11,2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at a higher level with the president of the European Central Bank and the head of economic competition of the European Commission.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer from the Eurozone crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves for more than a year, therefore the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense can be considered as precedent.
According to the decision taken early on Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the Bank’s property in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a part of its business, including mainly the activities - mainly insurance - bought last year from the Dutch ABN Amr<0xC3><0xB3>.
Fortis shares began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
Analysts agree, however, that with its 85,000 employees this bank is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company’s shares fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has declined by more than two-thirds.
Looking at current stock prices, the total value of the group's capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management blamed the sharp fall in Fortis shares on the insecurities of the U.S. market in connection with the approval of the $700 billion U.S. package plan.
On Monday, stocks already showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank’s clients so far there has been no panic, they have not invaded the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when viewing drug purchase data.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which to the use of the data of the recipes in all cases binds it to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the henhouse to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the program of follow-up of medical prescriptions.
Insurance companies make the price of insurance and the amount of compensation dependent on the client’s health status and if they think the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before, they sent the client to medical check-up and signed the contract with him, knowing the result of the check-up.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the disease and state of health of the customer.
For example, if you consistently take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has hardly anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some drugs are multipurpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk-increasing factor for insurance companies while the former is not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
The authorities are already forcing them to do this, although they have not received a fine for negligence until now.
Some companies have also recently developed the results of laboratory tests and by combining them with drug consumption data, they get more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
The bill that gives the right to control the specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another issue that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, in spite of everything, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
Global menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually trade partners, this issue in addition to the other mostly global issues dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs but member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit launched yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, current EU President, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, and Javier Solana, the main foreign policy representative, welcomed Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double their trade to more than 100 billion euros in five years.
Bearing in mind that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
Thus they legally harmonized the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of the latter - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also urged, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, just as at next year’s climate conference a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wished to hinder the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the deal would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book expects for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of goods and cultural activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A meeting with the stamp will follow at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors progressively decreases over the total of Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane found missing a year ago
The remains of the plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The debris has been found on a high plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the area of the Sierra Nevada of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
"The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have the confirmation that it is the very thing that Steve Fossett was flying over on the day of his disappearance," he said in a press conference.
The commissioner said no human remains were found on or around the plane.
The 63-year-old millionaire was presumed dead in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Security (NTSB) has announced that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squadron of investigators has been sent to identify the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, again in California, not far from the edge of Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett’s name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett’s search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world tour in a hot air balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world tour by plane and without stopovers.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An off-the-shelf SUV with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
It is this, in short, Glk the latest born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Proper for the content outside the traditional, will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central street of the Milanese shopping, Como Avenue, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed in the avenue Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, there is a ban on access to sports events.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fans either.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these from Sofia have been added a small group (few units, in fact) of the Campaign and from Apulia.
They have three-colored flags showing the city of origin of the militants: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, the Levski.
The Figc had put at the disposal of the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the Minister of the Interior had already controlled them all: among what they had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibited access to sporting events) at that time, none that had been forbidden to frequent a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of stadium crime, were turned down the ticket and the trip.
Now the Ministry of the Interior is waiting to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or who has been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they're not gonna set foot in a stadium anymore.
Thankfully!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty others should be added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way," the interior ministry said.
That's why, "eyes wide open" especially in view of Wednesday's National League game in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of Ultras Italia holders.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the raised arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...".
This is the (unhappily expressed) thought of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the post that was previously of Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste Public Safety where there is a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s anthem: those too are not a crime, but if they allow, they are not educational either.
