A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama's Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Republican lawyers have reported only 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws starting in 2009 that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day, and remove citizens with a judicial record from voting rights.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to set such a requirement.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such an identity document.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect youth, minorities, and low-income people.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
More than that.
Students, considered to be more likely to vote for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
Two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
Republican lawmakers sponsored laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17 per cent in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have enacted laws in five other states to reduce the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same was true of Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, whites who made up 76% of voters represented only 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes from Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that were passed and see it as an obvious goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that the states that passed these laws accounted for 171 of the 270 votes needed for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the APS test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes even more hesitant men already reluctant to pass screening tests.
To pass the test or not?
We have sought the advice of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who did not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that we are between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if we are not detected.
So I recommend the test from age 50, or from age 40 if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
The degree of risk of cancer must be made clear to the patient, by offering possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not harm life in the long term, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest they do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria for deciding who should or should not be dealt with are being precisely determined.
I recommend taking the test anyway.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not we should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from them.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is very damaging to people’s health.
“There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after smoking cessation, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity over a lifetime protects against colon cancer," it added.
The food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too many cases, it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
The meats too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," it says.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one of them noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another instead noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test doesn't give cancer."
The Higgs Boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "least worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but data is still lacking to be perfectly certain.
Suppose, however, that it is the Higgs, since the chances of making a mistake seem slim, and let's see what it is.
There is, in this lower world, a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
But even if particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From here, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they can be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "particles of force", through which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it must be pointed out here, are not all as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in that precise place, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" arises an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, a bit as if it were a frozen pond of which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN's - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Not all particles, not all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold of itself on a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, you know) do not.
Now, what "can bring" all this research, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between observations and predictions of the MS.
There are also many who ardently wish that we find them, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plug certain holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oops!).
But no such gaps have been found at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of this research on the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. All-World are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers at Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work was going to trigger.
They were looking at scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, physicist Willard Boyle — who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 — told us beforehand that the laser was rather seen as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not at all his original intention, now serves as an "eye" to all the digital cameras in the world, and earned him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... <0xE3><0x83><0xBB><0xE3><0x83><0xBB><0xE3><0x83><0xBC><0xE3><0x83><0xBC><0xE3><0x83><0xBC><0xE3><0x83><0xBC><0xE3><0x83><0xBC><0xE3><0x83><0xBC><0xE3><0x83><0xBC><0xE3><0x83><0xBC><0xE3><0x83><0xBC><0xE3><0x83><0xBC><0xE3><0x83><0xBC><0xE3><0x83><0xBC><0xE3><0x83><0xBC>
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
In this crucial area, however, much remains to be done.
The Duty tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that gnawed on him had left him a two-year respite.
"They had given me five years to live, I turned seven," he said, half-fig-half-grape, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home, Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for that,” he says.
Disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Lying in front of an appetizing lunch, he agreed to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, speaks to strangers who work around him, bring him his medications, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
“In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pisses standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Regressing to the child stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept regression, he notes.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and stifled".
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I don’t have any wishes in life anymore,” she said, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
In the coming days, however, she awaits a final visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, we spend, with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed per 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether in terms of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When dying, we will agree to provide mouth care with brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died overnight.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help the loved ones as much as the patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow each other but are not alike.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family gathering in the courtyard, snuggled in his pillows while being trinched in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there are still three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois House and the Société de société de soins palliatives <0xC3><0xA0> domicile du Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that has caused many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care leaders including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing well enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients will ask to die only because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists struggle with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helene Richard's hopes for survival were already low when she dropped out of strenuous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
Yet she told me I was finished!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not acceding to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for Palliative Care at Home in Greater Montreal, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to putting the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: “I want to die.”
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and specialists of the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know about a formidable "system", mixing construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has crumbled since we took the big steps," said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former police chief of Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a thorough investigation into the embezzlement related to roadworks contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only consented in hindsight.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and corruption of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the only Department of Transportation would have saved a billion dollars on contracts,” he said.
The Charbonneau Commission “has already brought down two mayors,” he adds, hoping that it will manage to “demonstrate the schemes behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also engages with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the police of the "Marteau squad" that, since 2009, would have led the "cartel of sewers" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and brought charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly pocketing bribes in exchange for government contracts.
Engineers at the Montreal roadway and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, are also formally charged.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who paid the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed wildly in the 2000s, giving more than C$88,000 (approximately $68,000) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power at the time.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts whose costs he inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts for which he inflated the costs.
Other road officials confessed to grease their paw by inflating bills by 30% to 40%, with fake extras.
Then a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his cashiers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first women elected in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she is insurgent since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and sold... 1.6 million to developers, in full real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says that she "draws a wire to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the wrongdoers".
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we would need a proper investigation unit in Montreal and a surveillance unit, so as not to see the dubious practices return.
Just like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elects aware of the ploy", when they did not sink into the trickery!
Estimated at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the situation, he said: "As long as election spending is not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He calls for a complete overhaul of the system of public contracting and party financing: "We can't go any further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look into their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I move forward with them.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
In a match, it’s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not inflamed.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that every workout is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to cope and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Oh, sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with fancy clubs.
He has played with great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming conversation with him.
I came out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you think of PSG’s first season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as a leader.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th finals with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our pool, in front of Porto, to be able to receive in the 8th final return.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the duration.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this title.
Last season, we didn’t go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a really big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It is normal that we expect a lot of us in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it is sure to be a bit frustrating.
I wonder what people are expecting more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game plan.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer present.
Look at Manchester City, which hasn’t managed to qualify for the 8th finals in two seasons, they’ve also made huge expenses!
With regard to the sums invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
PSG seems to be totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s exploits.
The better to say that there is a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and has a lot of goals.
He came for it and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, the man and the player are respected.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling game time.
I saw things there and I came out strengthened.
Today, I am able to make good matches in the national team.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we must have exemplary behaviour.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires winning.
Just like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) won on October 16 in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around ten dollars (the prices are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
Yet the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competiting with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to progress in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and processes the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both bookkeepers, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually done between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins do exist in the public ledger, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge to computers, the winner of which, as a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hashing phase, that is, transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "shaking" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular imprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to cheat, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the one hundred millionth, which leaves some margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also noted with each increase in computing power.
Network life has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins stolen in deposits.
"The flaw used is not about the protocol itself," said Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Powerful actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in case of success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we punished by considering them terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former chief refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign armed presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they were joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be tolerated when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, took place in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban raids on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and in blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had then been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land to resell to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They disdained themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American riches: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of cell phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already preoccupied with rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the position of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has, since the 1950s and long before, been dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in good condition, no major irrigation systems are repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
There was a rumor that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only here to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already nearly left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s largest employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which rely heavily on imports and exports, will also have to re-establish normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: high school for girls, boys, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of making aids and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has led, and has carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and actions of village agricultural rehabilitation in dozens.
This work, greedy of local labor, could help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of arable areas.
What will we leave as a memory, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they wished for, a small, well-controlled and directly affecting civil aid should be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution in force in Egypt
This is another poker move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its all.
Taking everyone to court, he announced Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state gave this House an additional two months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text for almost two years, which has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "betray his word" and "tread the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as protests rage across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this use of a hasty vote stems from the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers", these are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, overwhelmingly Islamist, voted for the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals missed the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, feeling that they had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, most of the articles were voted unanimously.
Some commentators were amused by the fact that one of the only divergences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, with some members of the committee deeming the constituent's pendulum to be ill-adjusted.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, has 234 articles.
Article 2 remains the same as the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” replied the Liberals, who saw it as a communication stunt.
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are further aroused by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
“For the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not Ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" tempers Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ed.].
And the question may in the future arise to what extent civil judges are competent to rule on it.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extended powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
They also express their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticidal.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no article echoes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will march them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Center of the World and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of biblical truths, modern comfort and wilderness.
Argumenty i Fakty has chosen five main reasons to go to Israel.
Go and adore the holy places
A must-see: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these “baptismal funds” will be touched by divine grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where the fishing was miraculous.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk the Street of Suffering or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the Praetorium), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Anointing and the burial.
It is here that the Christian centre of the world stands, a symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected in the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred site of the Jews: the Wailing Wall which constitutes the remainder of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of Masada Fortress, a former refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins lie on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can go there on their own.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont that welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
The old belief is that pagan gods once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
Unable to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First of all: the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also worth seeing is the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It exhibits mainly the paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of molds of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars are shining.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel's three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the temperature of the water does not fall below 21 <0xC2><0xB0> while that of the air can reach 23 <0xC2><0xB0>.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure water contains brine and very easily retains bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
We come to carry out a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow alleys that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who have come to do photo shoots from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll in the Roman theater, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, notably Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you are going to Israel, do not worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchanged in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, scaleless fish and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, balls of ground chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk haughtily.
We can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars at night.
These cats love passing places and do not refuse to be given a treat.
Renting a car varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visas were cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Who has a language, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are debating what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling “fake” certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to make money to help their families who stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law has come into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
At the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Immigration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law will have to be validated.
You will need to validate your language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained educational certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centers will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions of Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it do?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, respond the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many are talking about defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without an understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will be tormented for months without food and without paper and will have to work between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are cheated, they are taken their passport, and they do not receive the expected salary,” Tolib Charipov, head of the Directorate of Migration Services for the work of Tajikistan’s Migration Service, said in a statement.
Don't argue with me, Officer!
However, many nationals of Central Asian republics who wish to come to Russia for money are confident that they not only know the language of the country they wish to go to, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even a fair primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to make money as soon as the opportunity presents itself.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and weakened."
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will be intended only for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and still these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 rubles.
And then, one can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They are asking us for 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," Tajik national Umed Khuchkadamov told reporters.
“Be quick, don’t skimp, and buy yourself a fine work of art.”
From the first day the language law came into force, it was discovered that migrants' registration papers were not the only ones to be forged.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not take them for granted: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Power representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper tips".
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to pass the first-time examination time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms bearers.
Such is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shootings at weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow jurist Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a gun licence from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter has appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this insane hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that tightening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, today in Moscow you can find any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main canals are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking gun commands
The first is the "military trace", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
“These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians,” Baranets said.
The second type of black market weapons are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stockpiles and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often experienced explosions.
“Certified versions indicate that some fires were deliberately set to cover up the deficit,” he said.
For Baranets, the arms manufacturers are for something.
"We see private weapons factories that do not compete with the competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," said one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from the weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "due to the fault of employees whose work is related to weapons", the report explains.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "illegal searches".
An armoury salesman and consultant who has asked to remain anonymous says that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will look for the new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, for example a TT pistol.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a wire mesh.
“He transports it to the city and sells it for €900 per unit with two chargers,” he says.
“It’s true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be clarified, they make a control purchase from illegal arms dealers,” he added.
"Like in a luxury shop"
The seller and the buyer usually find themselves through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun was given to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
In order to find a gun, I have to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you have to also come saying for example "From such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give them to him.
Young children are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former militaryman Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s as he prepared to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he said, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want".
“I thought I was in a luxury shop,” the soldier recalls.
There is no secret to the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the seller in the forest and set up a target.
“They let me shoot and when I’m convinced that the weapon is working well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
"It is enough to have a precise amount of money," it is written in an advertisement on the site "Buy a pistol or a combat machine gun".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And sell to miners?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People run over food like hungry wolves and then find themselves mining coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I have heard of this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take the lead.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"In return, he receives a photo and instructions indicating where the gun is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the right to a gun association.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can end up without a gun and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
“People run over food like hungry wolves and then they end up mining coal in Siberia,” he says.
One Makarov for $100
Buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a gun", one can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It came out of the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the ministry, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the number of such crimes in Russia overall decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles, while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs fell by 7.8%.
US: Fast-food and supermarket employees are on strike
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teens go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has mounted against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave is going to grow or wind down quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Alongside the rise in low wages for basic workers at Walmart and fast food chains, protest organizers want to see unions set up.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday," as a swarming rain of sales gripping millions of people swept across America and sometimes triggered splinters.
That day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize strike pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores, whose products are aimed at consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to shotguns to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid Walmart employees shop only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply due to the low salaries of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests demanded a salary increase, they complained that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who earns $9.5 an hour, this is an amount he cannot afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That’s 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart were to transfer the entire wage increase to consumers, every ride in the store would cost them 46 cents more.
They will spend just $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did no harm to the group.
"Black Friday" continued in stores from 8am in the evening to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over that period 5,000 items per second.
Its cashiers have made a total of 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that in all "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a "com" operation among many others on the part of the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned not the Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not much appreciated, that is why they are not there yet) but the McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s announces to sell billions of portions and then they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you for the work you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast foods increase them over time, but on average, its basic employees make $ 8.90 an hour in New York.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with this amount in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum we find comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you are going to feed them with.
The protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters with bullying or layoffs.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, grabbing fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary turnover of the staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces to sell billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the work you honestly did!"
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio who said that "we all need to support fast food workers to get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized the event as the largest in the fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not to mention that not all of them were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult to say at this moment whether this spark of mass movement will make little ones.
"At the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, Google unveiled its current model at its annual conference this summer and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, shows that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained at the moment pixels on flat screen and sometimes touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in motion control.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although the Kinect has rendered the physical interaction, a lot of things take place on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of the information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for now, not really.
We're trying to change that and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out into ours, into the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It is appreciated, but isn’t it overrated?
One cannot say that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not large gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or can't do at some point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be for example laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we are interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, it adds work to algorithm designers.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution along the axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond lab, gave the touch of the sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 <0xCE><0xBC>s, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames per second.
Shouldn’t we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem.
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how it could help define locations.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone with your hands raised is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transient" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes their strength (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It perfectly registers the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really meant to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a precise point where the finger is and that gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work with perspectives.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is still a task down there that will take a long time to work on: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that they are walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the "Petersburg avant-garde" project dedicated to urbanites who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors of the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city’s border and have found recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that can be found near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the trendy parties and openings.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always bring crowds together, no matter where they are exhibited.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical Petersburger storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbary and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role because of his existence, his philosophy and his image as a bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you walk around the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a couturier specialized in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image maker and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were.
I knew it was my way.
Then the wave of the old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I began to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevshchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to find myself at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where the best creative forces must meet.
In 1995, I took place at Pushkinskaya-10 which housed before the works a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy playback songs in tight-fitting jerseys, including Igor Vdovin, a modern-day composer.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg ran a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that is when his great career began, but his training and his basic education, it is at us that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees have gone there as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named Painter of the Year, and that's when my reign came to an end.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong current and acuity.
I'm going to have an exhibition programmed "The Russian Museum Through the Clowns."
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's scary to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything disappears, the tragic falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and obligatory disguise.
Today, it is the clothing that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit in his face.
And the lie will be blotted out by the disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the organ player of Barbary. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else but me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be neat, delicate, liqueur.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Previously, people were divided into herds, bohemian supporters loved one thing, fooled them into another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw away who come to see it, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and at the end of the day it's less management, less money, it's all gone.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually those that are painted at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
During the reign of the good tsars, it was not like this, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow today, there are good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are dismissed, because it takes higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and pave the way for them.
Currently, it is the "kingdom of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time pushing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Childbirth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate change or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with earthlings on board set out in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to make our species live in weightlessness or on a planet of relief?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, we were still experimenting with plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then, we put in orbit insects, small reproductive Drosophila flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how a weightless embryo developed.
A completely normal chick is obtained at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chick has to find support, it has to get on its legs and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
When they could not find any support, the chicks were agitated in a disorderly way.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We rolled their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the "Bion" biosatellite will carry only species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about biosatellites, and then it's the only experiment, and we have to do this kind of research," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to carry out reproductions directly in space.
It's not a small matter.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans are capable of this in principle.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our gull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would stand after a space flight.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
“No one answered that question,” said Vakhtang Vatchnadze, a retired rocket and space worker.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice in orbit and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbital flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train for extra-vehicular exits.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
To the extent that the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's belly, it is easier for him to then get used to the water.
This is in principle logical, because from his birth until his first bath, it only happens 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on birth simulators.
Of course one can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get it out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite reflection on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the attraction of the earth, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
One cannot dress an infant like an adult with a special training suit.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experiment that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely misfit," said Igor Pestov, Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their spaceborn offspring.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institution for the Control of Public Finances) said: "The control of pseudo-self-employment (in Czech "<0xC5><0xA0>varc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it lags behind in its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution, said in an interview with Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its enforcement must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint check by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar findings.
He cites Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' approach to the "<0xC5><0xA0>varc system" as an example of abusive practice.
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the SDG is not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls; is it allowed or prohibited?
“The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from inspecting the law,” Kala said.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation stipulates how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation as well as a proper practice follow.
We have collected all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more stringent and of better quality", nevertheless, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continuously develop more and more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote oneself to the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it mean for you?
A common control of this kind should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and to improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering the market thresholds will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork that those who seek it will find far more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our CSI or a different mode of organization?
As for the institutions, similarly to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is similarly organized, it also has a council constituted somewhat differently, but these two institutions proceed basically in a similar way .
The powers are also, to a certain extent, similar, but with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has such courses of account at the level of the various Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our country corresponds to state resources.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities are there controlled at the level of the Länder's account prices.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model but it certainly cannot be said that it is doing better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider to be a model, also faces a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean to you as an institution, are its effects already being felt?
Since this amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out ex post checks, there is a certain delay.
Our comments concern only, for the moment, the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched a new "risk of mismanagement" instrument with which we have screened nearly 14,000 public contracts - where these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulatory regime, the claimant (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programs) forced the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the market law meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really helpful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it, but not punish those who make formal mistakes without affecting the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDG is not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system - what does it mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demanding compliance with the law.
He may declare, "We will change the law and authorize it," but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing was wrong.
The Law on Contracts contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be performed, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
Roads are sometimes frozen, but most remain practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practicable this morning, but in frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures have dropped and range between -5<0xC2><0xB0> and -10<0xC2><0xB0>C but they are expected to rise slightly in the day.
Snowfall has ceased in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
However, the ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né hory) are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service show that visibility was reduced in some places due to fog.
The R6 highway and national roads in the region are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance remains to be taken, for example on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-category roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There is still on some of their stretches of frozen snow and in places crowded by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be more vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
The Directorate of Roads and Highways reports on its website that some roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by ice formation and that traffic-packed layers of snow can be found on roads in mountainous areas and located at altitude.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region located at altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, mainly on departmental and third category roads.
Routes I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed by traffic is present on the roads in areas located at altitude.
In East Bohemia, the weather will be dry, mostly clear, and overcast.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3 <0xC2><0xB0> and + 1 <0xC2><0xB0> C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practicable, although in some places increased vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions are required.
It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3 <0xC2><0xB0> and -9 <0xC2><0xB0> C.
After the last snowfall and the subsequent cooling, some routes of communication can be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to pass through fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is shown by the information provided by the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is practicable almost without difficulty, however, the maintenance services of road communications recommend increased vigilance between the 80 and 131 kilometers.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some stretches can be frozen in the Pilsen-Sud district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on less busy roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region must now rely on a layer of thick, soft snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, after chemical processing operations.
Snowfall last night forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field; according to the services in charge of the road, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the roads are easy to navigate.
" On the heights of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district are snow remnants.
Drivers driving towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k should expect to meet at the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass a layer of thick and soft snow ", said today in <0xC4><0x8C>TK the head of road maintenance services of the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
Their colleagues from the Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k district also visited the site overnight; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are easy to drive, in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk the drivers should however be careful in the stretches in forested areas with roads remained wet.
Regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec
From this morning, the road maintenance services of North Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
Police data show that in addition to some snow-covered or ice-covered areas, the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice na <0xC3><0x9A>stecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially to the south-east of the Bohemian Central Plateau, there are, on the contrary, no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic problems have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, especially around <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow melt during the day, clear skies and frost at night.
Difficult conditions on National Road 13 on the border between the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec regions are also reported from the main traffic axes.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Kninice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of snow until reaching the roadway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy. "
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news stories, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh and say that we are the only group able to collect a remnant of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project to our readers in more detail?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for the past two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end virtually by the time the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who's got this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world called "End of the World Cancelled" (Czech: "Konec sv<0xC4><0x9B>ta zru<0xC5><0xA1>eno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it at these charity concerts?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also be joined at some point as part of a very unique live broadcast on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings there as well...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and it amuses them.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training center that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and whose realization we are working on as part of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, with the Tap association, and that for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Institute and offer activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several bands and performers take to the stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria do you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program that is aimed at all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere will perform with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will be playing for the first time in the Prague Spring; there too, we will surely prepare a quality programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic house in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not as bad as it looks at first.
We have five members in an electric chair whose gear has to travel in the hold, of course we also pack a lot of luggage and instrument boxes.
So far everything has been more or less always going well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Through your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all is still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there, too, an association is being created to focus attention on the problems of people with disabilities.
How do we catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are on the contrary at the forefront of progress!
Public respect and easy access are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or jurists among us.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to get involved in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we lost a bit of control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
It's true, building connections with well-known singers and actively working to promote the band helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to subsidies from the European Union, we can, in addition, afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
Show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity on.
They are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them but for society as a whole.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be uncompromising in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think that's completely normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
Only one, L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We are an open group, people come and go, we can't do anything about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the day before the planned day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
The event will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when The Tap Tap's song "End of the World Cancelled" will be sung jointly.
The aim of the concert is to raise financial resources (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre located in Prague in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in a number of ESA projects.
Poland's journey to space, however, began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld's lecture at the Astronomical Observatory in Warsaw on December 6, 1933, in which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his work "Introduction to Astronautics".
Doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned propagator of astronautics, his contribution was notably rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon.
In 1925 a rocket engine was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the draisine.
The only information known about this draisine is that of the press of the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The records show that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric fighter rocket, drawn by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" was published by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects using the rocket technique were led by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other aeronautical works were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal Probl<0xC3><0xA8>me, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and by the fall, the PTA had become a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902–1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters was 80 cm long and weighed just under 5 kg.
Later an improved version, RM-1A, was built, and in the summer of 1959 flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket began in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962-1965 succeeded the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 litres, while the Meteor-1B had a volume of 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C had a volume of 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965-1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Later versions of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is still worth mentioning the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision has sparked a lively public debate.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the different economic entities as well as the national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and free (unlimited) movement of private capital allied with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (wages) generate a tension on prices.
It is necessary to put the following meaning under this term: a producer strives by importing low-sold goods to resist economic competition by "making" the price of the competitor more expensive, with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increasing his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either moving production abroad, buying at low prices, or disappearing, the result being significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the state necessarily increase.
All this situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is manifested mainly in the amendments of the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the dictate of private capital prices, especially in the field of wages.
This is due on the one hand to a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other hand to the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
The result is growing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot provide for themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for wage earners to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay an extra fee so that they reach the vital minimum.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all southern EU member states undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day their private capital will be invested in their country.
The question here is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, tirelessly, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the led economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is therefore necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, and even direct, politics today, according to its own selfish interests, and by the same token, the whole state.
The answer to that question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is an almost all-powerful lobby present in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the drafting of laws to law firms closely related to industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as Western-type constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State was long in decline and functions were assigned by violence.
Bribes, illegally obtained favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The under-the-table and the corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with already sold voices" ... ... "The honest people did not seek at all to obtain positions, it resulted once the state was transformed 8 months without consuls".... ' We really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy, but that it was necessary to choose a man with energy "
In conclusion, as in antiquity, present-day society is based on the preference for personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as in the past, is an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that today’s elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long run.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international level and at the internal European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution consists of reforms with socio-political aims, which will strengthen investments in state capital in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
“Nothing will ever come out of the violence and it will never be able to,” Sting says in the song titled “Fragile,” whose main verse of the chorus is “let’s not forget how fragile we are.”
“If my sons did not want wars, there would be no wars,” said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have arisen.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing for its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view "behind the curtain", on the one who benefits mainly from the tensions that have already lasted for more than 95 years (since the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East countries.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others emerge from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
In every age, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living in an age where global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been able to take place in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Very little is written about them.
Of course I did.
In the nineties of the nineteenth century, they acquired the world's leading news agency (Reuters) in order to stop the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase of their fortune or both.
They own major stakes in almost most of the world’s central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such stakes (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only of 4, meanwhile Russia put the Russian central bank under control).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America's status as a central bank and began issuing his own money during the civil war (I hear it well) and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 as he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for world power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing more than the beginning of such an absolute, final solution) and, in the end, acquire.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following the chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed to avoid the repetition of crises such as those they provoked in 1907).
After successfully triggering the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers let the politicians create a situation of latent conflict: they, on the one hand, imposed massive war reparations on Germany, thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished German masses (they then only need to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing fingers at the culprits, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand,
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundation for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
World War II broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held him; or whether everything he did was planned, however, the fact is that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that war reparations imposed on Germany led to World War II, the founding of the State of Israel lit a fire that could cause a third world war.
If the international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but on an international level (just see how people sharply divide between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is the culprit and victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong breeds another in an endless cycle of violence and where one finds, at the origin of everything, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
Here we have to differentiate between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, like at home, international bankers only offer to the people in elections their own candidates.
The current naval prime minister of Israel is a typical example of a world-fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to the adherence of that country to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) expand to become a world conflict and, given that Iran's
David Rockefeller once said, “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their view, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a fully controlled being.
“Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to wear a red iron mark on their hands or foreheads, so that they may neither buy nor sell anyone who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: that he who has common sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number designates the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of protesters made up of Islamist students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, further aggravated by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused in the United States a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated adventures, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a shocking cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make sightings for the shooting of a sci-fi movie.
Combination of genres
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan called for Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a realistically conceived political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, of a betrayal - as, for example, in the Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirty trilogy.
The atmospheres follow one another: Tehran sequences of documentary style (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to arouse ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It’s also Affleck’s first film that doesn’t take place in his hometown of Boston.
A place’s sense of atmosphere is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real events; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive for its clarity that also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occur when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that offered in fact few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
He does very well, he sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the airstrip are quite hair drawn).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with a moderate interest, appreciating the direction and retro style of the 70s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in a certain way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the trick.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a public survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the contest of the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, adopting a quota of 40 percent of women for the management of large European companies was the origin of our decision," said the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher, to the newspaper Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
Among the absurdities mentioned are, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because, objectively, they pose a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to higher prices.
Criticism has also been expressed in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto).
The interests of lobbyists are also, for example, behind the fact that in the Union bananas must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonizing inhomogeneous national standards that complicate trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some states, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize can be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that must include on inflatable balloons a warning that children under 8 years old should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a U.S. survey that said balloons are the leading cause of child deaths from choking among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
We have some weird ideas here, too.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Laissez Faire" association of liberal economists, the server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com named in this investigation, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation concerning the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks that could be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and risked a heavy fine as a result.
The organizers of this survey found interesting the idea of paying sums of money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for subsidies.
These ideas, however, do not originate from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund," said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and as a result of the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without sea access.
Subsidies for obtaining grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), these were to be used, concretely, to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Weird regulations are rare".
While regulations are often criticised in Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning as well as its overall development deserve praise.
More serious, for example, is the problem, according to experts, of the use of EU subsidies for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries in the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a struggle from which it is not always the winner) is a source of great emotion for the Czechs.
If, after six years of battle with the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", as for the name "Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum" which dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not on beet sugar, may bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, we find today in the company of world-renowned cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0xBD> carp ("ch<0xC5><0x99>eli<0xC5><0xBD> a<0xC5><0x99>epo<0xC5><0xBD>").
Pardubice gingerbread ("Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> pern<0xC3><0xAD>k") and cakes called "Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice cornets" ("ho<0xC5><0x99>ické trubi<0xC4><0x8D>ky") can also be proud of their Community trade mark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not being a senator or a president that matters to me.
If everything worked out smoothly in our country, I wouldn’t be a candidate anywhere.
But I can’t stand to see how the country has been looted for the last twenty years, that thieves are not under locks and taxes and the retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don’t like, then I try to bring a solution so that it changes.
And since I am over forty years old and independent, a member of no party, I have no other way of influencing the situation than to run in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out for the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said that I'll start the battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Subsequently, I made it clear that if I were elected senator, I would run in the presidential election.
My goal is not function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we grumble at the bar or in front of our television set, but it is also that we trample on coughing those who are trying to bring about change.
To this is added the press that breaks the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I bribe journalists or that I was Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek's advisor.
Let's come to your visions.
You have begun the struggle for the Castle with the themes of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK] as a battle horse.
To this end, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for tourist guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly rejected and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I have a much better chance of getting the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you think of yourself as a left or right-winger?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people place me rather to the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
The important thing for me is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but that people are brought together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the SDGs, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone says you’re a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have talked about them.
But without the support of parliament, you have only slogans left.
You won’t survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should eventually explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President by direct suffrage, which was achieved thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without a doubt, to be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just got into politics and I'm trying to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to a number of personalities and asked them to run in the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1> who revealed the oil frauds.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, for the most part, gave their vote to an establishment representative.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
In spite of everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I also don’t have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my “transparent” account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about $60 million.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I've always loved James Bond, who drove in cars, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
Do you drive in Aston Martin, have a heritage worth 60 million and don't have any money for your campaign?
Do you want to change the Republic but do not want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I get in debt?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program doesn't attract much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the compensation I will receive as a senator.
But I could not live on it, for example, to pay my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I won't run for office.
Are you going to continue your business activities so that you can live?
Didn't you say you'd mute your business?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You can find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Pr<0xC3><0xA1>va.
The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be convinced, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large nearby company, tells us: "Yes, this building is indeed beautiful."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes willingly to one of these nerdy libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing appealing at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 people has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give back a few neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty little miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, baffled and shrugging, Maas, the cheeky, piled up his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by activist arguments with one: "Common dear!"
Here she is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain sprang from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and semi-detached houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this dull little village, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall of a mind-boggling ugliness, whose white facades invite one to think that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched with a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
True, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you walk on the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant street lights speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, the library shelves are along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Willy Maas.
We have completely disrupted the classic spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been skillfully arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black shelves of the library, which are sometimes paneling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircases.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in a Frisian farm an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membranes of one millimeter thickness have been used for years as substrates in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and you save time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” Trouborst says.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass bell, the sun illuminates the interior only for a short time, even on sunny days.
The thick wooden beams mounted across the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade serve as a sunshade, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "at last found soul".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure filled the gaps in the library that was not yet fully filled (today it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library."
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV achieved the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page in literary history.
Although she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian demand for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
- Why? - Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must exercise caution, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not overly critical of Israel.
During the Libyan insurgency in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore clashed on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still groping for this role, but they are on the path to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term “normal” foreign policy mean for Germans?
It shows a willingness to take positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and abstention in the UN vote?
Germany first had important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to hit public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this, because it is not an exclusively one-sided relationship.
But this is, in any case, a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I think the divide is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, views on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, of course the government cannot defend its position publicly.
I believe that real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm about Netanyahu’s policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes it any easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must affirm their singular position.
This is what they are currently doing on the euro issue.
In my view, Germany will take on a locomotive role in the future and push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been a delicate one.
But in my view, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international scene, does Germany just want to take on a key role?
Or is she still struggling to take on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable for it and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a bigger role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
That doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with very varied neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this gap, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
And even if they do not like it, even if it is unpleasant and if they are only less appreciated, it is life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, D.C., an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America analyze together the challenges of the transatlantic community.

"Marketing protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, she's not sure she'd win.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the firm Taylor Wessing, which specializes in infringing property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few extra letters to register their marks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also being legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a folder containing the registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: his constituents task him with tackling the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a related brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially for costly flagship products.
According to data from market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the world's third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market.
However, it is not easy to remove dubious registrations from the trademark registry and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machine builder Sany, the same company that had just bought concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's acquirer, used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW's. The dispute was settled and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against plagiarists in Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits, however, that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office reportedly moved last year from an “emergency situation in the course of work to a restored normality”.
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have fallen by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 cases remain outstanding at the Office.
Acting is expensive
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and it means that China is for the tenth time in a row at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly had 1.8 billion yuan in registration fees.
In other words, each record earned an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg illustrates.
For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese plagiarist.
Certainly, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the impersonator was able to maintain his Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany,” says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office therefore rejected the objection of the Munichers.
Freudenberg certainly won in the next two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds, "the procedure is long, challenging and costs us a lot of time and money."
Internal costs are also difficult to assess, and the archives department has even had to review the records of the past 100 years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered the opposing party a “big six-figure euro sum” to settle the dispute in vain.
“This is what we see what it means for us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to spill over to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file the name Freudenberg in Germany for a shoe and leather company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it had still been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler added: "Vigilance is required."
Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should rather "register in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs can be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and Swaziland’s AIDS orphans rejoice in their arrival.
This is the story of a link that spans much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, pumps for ladies and moccasins for men look for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers amplify slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they get carried away, enchant and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he leads the orchestra with his gestures of a wild flexibility.
It is Monday evening, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers between the ages of 23 and 69 came from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorister has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Be Helped to Help Yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a godfather.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "singer of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it brought to Germany to now return it to its native region: the South of Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers by air from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Estjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or dirt huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the ills that afflict Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population hardly ever accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s population is carrying the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in mid-thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongi mostly saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, it was just a few people who personally pledged to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, an association that has since taken care of orphans living with AIDS in Esitjeni in an almost professional way.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often appear in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, infections related to chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and the human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany; however, some 20% of new HIV infections are seen within this group.
In young people, the rate of chlamydia-related infections is significantly higher than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a one-tenth decrease from the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or through close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who often changes sexual partners undergo regular examinations.
Most quickly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, donations, but especially the funds that the choristers raise thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulating.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Estjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well housed, in one of their grandmothers for example.
The gogos, so called the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them host up to 14 orphans, provide them with a roof and ensure that they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
“AIDS is a real taboo,” explains Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a topic that touches on sexuality.”
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
These state-sanctioned customs, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
There are condoms on every corner, Lennartz adds, “but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to promote cultural exchange, the choristers of Imbongi travel together every two or three years in the South of Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition such that it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears a few formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esetjeni, where the choristers visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esetjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
“Go to Esetjeni, you will find light there,” say the people there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers in the air, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choristers who kick their feet in the rehearsal room of Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of an ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one makes a link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other life essentials have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small gaps through which infinity is observed.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union's new definition of the term.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the birth room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where stars are born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope photographed the flaming glow of a dying star.
The donut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer Telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, star clusters also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope puts more emphasis on colors.
In this infrared photo, the Helix Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent earned it the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the biggest puzzles in astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three streaks of dust divide the shining heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpent: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush toward each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is composed of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than common household dust.
This photo was made from optical and radiographic images taken by different telescopes.
The black hole circle is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way galaxy.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosetta Nebula, also permanently create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy of light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is not yet dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see further and further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economical construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great capacity for collecting light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Scientists are listening to the universe for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by using the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for ESO’s site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A gigantic new telescope is also expected to be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration makes it possible to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury’s South Pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
With the launch of the Messenger spacecraft in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97.
The journey to the Talysh Mountains is one of flamboyant romanticism.
At the turn of the many turns of the road, the small bus rides along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it almost looks like the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh lives, about which little is known, except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani perfectly and have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town stands out with its too aggressive Soviet-era architecture that does not match the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is much too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The province has yet to take advantage of the legendary wealth the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year, there will be the festival of the world's oldest people here," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
We can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region that are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he reached the age of 120.
Have another child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man allegedly married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he would still have conceived a daughter.
Would <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades when calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about the elderly man of Central Asia.
“Surprisingly old people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the non-existence of the documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is a fact that people in the Lerik area often reach an age worthy of the Bible patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tour guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of the people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, saw Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical of seeing it throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a barratta, whose contents she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children also play in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armadus glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are long braids of a dark blonde that her son proudly reveals to us.
I’ve always washed my hair with milk, and that’s how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I never used shampoo,” adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly Retirement is Enough to Live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who nevertheless ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats monthly (about the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-greying son is right: "elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The “Rights of Man” omitted in the Constitution
The revolution was reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep divide in the country.
The draft Sharia-based constitution is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not greedy of words filled with emotions.
We need to make the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he told state television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also especially for Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
For all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world don’t really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hastily drafted by the 100-person majority Islamic constituent assembly during a 15-hour night force tour are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
This was and still is a question of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
In any case, this suggests a newly introduced article stating that, with regard to all matters related to Sharia, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would de facto result in the judicial power being placed under guardianship.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the probable maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts worked to suppress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military.
The state must also protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematographic art and literature.
In other words, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording implying that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution is Reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on Cairo’s Tahrir Square, promising to bring down sharia law before it takes effect.
“The revolution is reborn and we are going to win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft constitution is "to be thrown into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to foment a “putsch against democracy.”
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for,” said Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition, according to Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
“Clean up our country!” they asked Morsi, claiming that “the Qur’an [was] their Constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft constitution, as well as its supporters, spoke loudly.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box the direction the country should take.
The project of the Islamists will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process which should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new constitution," he said during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto strips him of all his powers," Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could pay off.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: Is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to the locals’ appetite for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothing.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s most popular dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, ubiquitous, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When darkness sets in and it’s cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also called "Rakfisk General", who is in charge of managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” adds Havard.
Drinking kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it sounds like a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses lessened by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, a vital, though fragrant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often make mention of it in international news, which is not to his displeasure.
Here, people are unwilling to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about the “July 22 incident.”
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their own may have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason for our success,” says Anna, our waitress, with blond hair and a piercing blue eye, the image of Nordic well-being, with a plate of rakfisk in her hand.
We are, as you say, prudent people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out the window, in the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep its purse strings tight.
“As long as you can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"Not to mention the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and queue to buy food - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger made of momentum, a real discovery, it is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It looks like the Eurovision contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here's the points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish fumes.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a tough start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a security dam has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico’s economy is doing well, from the results that we owe to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populated and sprawling state that encloses the capital. In its land of choice, the opinions regarding this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises attribute to him the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once bumped and full of cracks.
Plaques bearing his name hang outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to bring about lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a congressman and party member of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economics in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so badly needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years spent outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, there are many expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who blame the new president for lacking charisma.
He is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image the people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more blatant.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years have been found on the edge of landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate far higher than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez – a place infamous for the number of innocent women killed there.
Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto say that at best he failed to stem the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” says Se<0xC3><0xB1>ora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the cadaveric rigidity had already begun.
While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old cunt, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
“But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has vowed to make it his priority during his tenure.
"I hope he will be as good as he was when he was governor," Congressman Olvera said in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during his detention.
The trial is about Manning’s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to file the case on the grounds that Manning's abduction took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to show on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the largest leak of classified information in the history of the U.S. military -- has missed numerous opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion demanding that the Manning case be dismissed on the grounds that the abduction took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified of his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms the officers had filled out after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he received from his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in prison was "overall very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed orally concerns about certain issues and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would take care of them, but they did not record the issues raised.
“They wrote ‘no problems’ (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn’t mean I hadn’t raised any issues,” Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a January 2011 interview with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed to indicate a “risk of injury.”
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was okay, and I wanted to be removed from this status ... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Marine Corps Base Military Prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he planned to commit suicide while in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also pointed out that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him so that they could see his face.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning’s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked for an entire night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge’s questions Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard’s order that he must release his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the rubber band on his underpants or flip-flops to injure himself, but he hadn't.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence should he be found guilty in a court-martial, a trial that is expected to be held early next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty to the less serious offenses and fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defense.
If all charges are upheld, he will be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two paths: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which way to go.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" all my life.
It’s an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves “Irish,” or my friends in New York when they call themselves “Italian.”
Then I became a Mexican-American.
But here it was Mexico.
And, on the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualification or a bond.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle an interview in one or the other language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed to the "Foreigners" line.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their preferred themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk it in the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede in writing half of their territory to the tip of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are undermining their neighbor's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
Do you want to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason for the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And more often than not, this person matched a typical profile -- dark, uneducated skin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are living the American dream right now, we have gone to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we are living, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocated.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they cough up us as if we were individuals of inferior strain and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who immigrated legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, as Mexicans more firmly claim their identity and Mexican-Americans are upset.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexican-Americans I know don’t feel like they’re part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, given the pervasive wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to deal with this on your own, amigos.
That's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still like the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought we were.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is yet another failure for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments for who started persist, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to believe that this could help them out of this deadly deadlock.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even though the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, this week’s fighting has bolstered supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has run Gaza since 2007, will brag about forcing Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has suffered a beating.
Having killed some of its leaders and pushed Gaza’s 1.7 million people back into one of the world’s most miserable and overcrowded corners, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a burgeoning regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken a stand for Hamas; as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s wealthiest and most dynamic states.
Hamas members rejoice and say that the Islamist crescent is curving around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its dominance, to Syria, where Islamist-leaning rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders more easily rely on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hardline supporters will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in the box.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America is renewing its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the source of the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared from suicide bombings, notably thanks to the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more hawkish party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, is on the bright side.
Why pamper these fucking Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they were to lead the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of the head.
Perhaps the hard-line supporters will win; but the Arab Spring may change the game.
Even if the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to address the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories – much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to stand up for this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to end the flow of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in line with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute far more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state at the UN.
Obama also has every interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packs have come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packets that are all the same, regardless of the brand
This law came into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible pictures of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking their parents.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous depiction.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their branding,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed for example that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has been lobbying against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said this would re-launch black market trade, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
“Negative consequences will result from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Forgers in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others have said that this law has boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-run company, said demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to hide horrible packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in Australia's high court.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 of them to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only boredom, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship and requiring retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you’re working in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the place to be par excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has bothered to make a video, or if this is an agency-orchestrated marketing campaign?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulation in place rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions – these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning pictures mandatory in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know about them.
"You take a cigarette and put the package away," Victor El Hage said when buying a package that featured a picture of a mouth tumor.
To be honest, the only reason I'm going to be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney, said uniform packaging made it difficult to store packages on displays.
“Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
“The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it’s okay, we stop and we put the key under the door,” he added, raising his arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to entertain you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us – and our children – to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, even to nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The boredom goes back a long way,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After scouring through numerous publications and submitting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists "of wanting to do something, but not succeeding in embarking on a satisfying activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though they would like to.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a sullen mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can look like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two can be linked, people who get bored tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we get bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants were listening on tape to the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some bands heard, coming from the next room, the overly loud sound of a TV show that was unrelated, others just heard the TV show, and the third band didn't hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they struggled to concentrate, but didn't know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, “like looking at objects on a assembly line, music can help you not get bored.”
In fact, he says, now we know that when you twist or scribble, these gestures, often considered signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to squat learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay still,” Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monochord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Boring Predisposition Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Of the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blushed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know if today’s percentages of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” not least because children and teens don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Boring is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t be bored anymore, but he won’t have learned to take care of himself or self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child doesn’t just learn to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Nor do I think we should criticize it.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant bubbling that activities and technology generate is the goal we should aim for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom arouses a keen, frenzied desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate downtime.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directives for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and soccer player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and materials that could be used for its consumption - minor offenses, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are being treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is there one?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on location than law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been classified with no consequences.
Police have stopped charging adults aged 21 and over with minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative constituencies have called for accelerating existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-licensed marijuana sales shops in their neighborhoods.
“Things are changing so fast that I don’t know what the future holds,” said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police for Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a licensing system, authorizing the production, manufacture, distribution and sale - by the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states when it comes to marijuana regulation, first for therapeutic use and now for personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and it’s a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent on which we could rely,” he said.
The Washington law, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal vacuum of one year, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees proper access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis sales shops within a 30km radius of a school, park, playground or nursery.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis sales business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Center, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an email to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" (public prosecutor's representative) would no longer prosecute people aged 21 and over who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop charging people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said police would enforce the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly in order to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them face other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed an offence that, at the time of the incident, was a recognized offence,” Buck said.
Reactions were complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the restricted marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer show up adults for possession of limited quantities.
The county prosecutor’s representative, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to dismiss all marijuana detention cases without further action.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent a good part of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so they have a hard time accepting that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are on the verge of becoming a case law for legalizing drugs.
While advocates and state officials are planning a new frontier of legalized sales, they are anxiously awaiting directives from the federal government, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization are hoping the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana sales businesses to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it’s true that police aren’t likely to push through the doors to grab small bags of drugs, there’s a good chance they’re opposing licensed marijuana-selling businesses for personal use allowed under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales businesses, even if this is only a one-year postponement.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose that ban next week.
“We don’t want to end up in a situation where someone is granted a permit and then we find ourselves faced with a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It’s not just today’s students who are being attacked for their opinions.
For as long as I can remember, I have always dreamed of entering the University of Oxford.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of knowledge, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were disconcerted.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that undergraduates had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said facetiously that I was gone after being forced to drink from chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I've run away.
Yes, I ran away because I had been bullied and was constantly bullied.
Not because of my rather outlandish name, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of so-called knowing, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about it today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students is undergoing the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s student hall (JCR) said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted” because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative on the University Equal Opportunity Committee so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", devoted to student politics, which portrayed the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among them was the student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", who travels in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and moves with a chrome-headed cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as scapegoats for implementing increased tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, a vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "there is growing left bias in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think so during my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and paralyzingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, because of reduced funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know each other and the professors, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I found that teachers not only participated in sarcasm towards Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy about striking miners, privatization and the government’s opposition to the apartheid sanctions in South Africa were engraved in the woods of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I've lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a pustulous face, was easily carried away.
"Are the Thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
“I suggest you take French classes in your free time – finally, if you’re not too busy making friends,” he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
I'm afraid that's the case.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Tory people claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher had said.
This scheme has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken up the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
“How do the Tories make love?” asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have just been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after nightfall?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my family and friends in the city who were more open-minded.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained to him why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreamy bell towers.
Even my communist friends had impeccable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a session of directed work the following week, when another history professor suggested the most serious in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Inwardly blushing with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who dug the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I was stuck in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can call me a weeping wet hen.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such bullying in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the highlight of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his cottage in Gstaad," says the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of beauties from the past such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
Even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
There were about 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the week of Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Nobility lineage parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves well-educated people with the biggest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium sixty meters wide that proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to scroll on the podium to admire a "public " dream wearing the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor who had chosen Jackie Kennedy for his marriage to Aristote Onassis.
Among this audience of models are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It’s a gift he gave me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier’s muses.
"I prefer him to all the others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty," added the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager living in Italy, she dreamed of being the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Eventually, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bustier and a drop-off neckline.
"It was a dream come true," Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow said.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses of the couturier with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that it conveys".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier calls his seamstresses) to make this dress in ivory silk with inlays of pearls, twelve kinds of different lace and a sleigh of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of haute couture of the late twentieth century, "the return of the clients of high society".
Obsessed for years with the nobility's "know-how", Valentino is now its best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of his clients.
"His refinement, his calm, his neat and perfect appearance have always struck me," admits de Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says so...
The World's Toughest Job: Kawah Ijen's Human Mules
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living carrying the sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with air.
After collecting large rocks of sulfur, which weigh in total about 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano that culminates at 2,386 meters of altitude, but worn out carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb that distance, at a tortoise pace, keeping balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur mined.
Once upstairs, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and painfully carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euros) per kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what he would gain in the fields.
“The income of miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the porter who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I'm going to Java.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Mishandled by life, this friendly and intelligent young man might be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wood measure with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not cease to spring at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater and lights up with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not receive a sub of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) increase per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for animals, not for humans,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent bearer who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", as he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weights.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, can only carry 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a weed-ridden goat path.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of her five children, aged 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but the misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this lack of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem implausible that these lyrics come from an advertisement for mint lozenges, but despite that, or perhaps thanks to that, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychinelle in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way through this ad.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill “their national duty.”
It’s only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of births, so we felt that this was a topic we needed to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like launching pheromone scents or hosting speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought to ourselves this: what could be more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take this so lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, lengthens maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its leaders’ conservatism and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the rate of renewal, was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, said it was due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family building,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and to delaying marriage and births, resulting in a lower birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound in barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of taking down wages and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore last year had its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small dwellings in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards raising the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans who work in the central financial district, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people put it off," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to have my money and my time,” another young man in his twenties tells us.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
So, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, the Singaporeans themselves have the final say.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from intrusion".
What is the private domain for children under the age of 16?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five young boys, between 10 and 15 years old, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level with "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
“I won’t reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says Jorge, 10, as he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them but not everyone,” he said.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I’m not going to share one of my photos or someone who would be a fool,” he said.
The boy admits that it is wrong to post obscene photos, nude people, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine Twitter followers.
The majority are family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password for one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they’re answering me, I just post them,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or with my friends, quickly,” he says.
He said he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust anyone who would recommend a foreigner to him.
The case of José, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people registered on his list of friends.
“It doesn’t bother me because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any advances or asked for his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would just remove them from my account,” he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberbullying are no stranger to the boy.
A relative of one of my friends was robbed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close his account.
"He only passed it on to a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I were angry or angry.
“Even though I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that, to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she said.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master’s degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book “Digital Natives and Immigrants,” uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, children and young people who are born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or said at an age when they do not have the necessary maturity to do so."
“We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents privacy is to use questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify photos of parties, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“Outside of the Internet, everyone has to act with respect, morality and other principles, it has to be the same on social media,” she said.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and education advisor, says it is essential that parents read the conditions of use of social networks conscientiously.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The UNASUR Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially indicated that it would be disclosed after the closing of the summit, and then claimed that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian government's website.
When questioned about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by Peruvian President Ollante Humala in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly restricted.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the journalists was that given by the press attachés of some of the governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, Peru’s presidency sent an email to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was President Humala’s speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this was requested by the press, it had not issued the declaration also known as the Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited to the maximum the obtaining of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague that decides a different border between the two countries.
Peruvian Presidents Ollanta Humala and Chilean President Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both sides in the trial Lima filed against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing before this international court today,” President Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era said, shaking hands with President Humala, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely erroneous.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from UNASUR since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of $ 17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, cheap Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our people,” concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give any further details.
Similarly, the outcome document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," President Santos said.
"We will revise all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask to have a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Similarly, in the framework of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take Europe as an example".
President Correa, who participated in the VI Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that the Europeans "had killed each other during the Second World War" and during other conflicts, "but they are now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the UNASUR member countries.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president has been in favour of reconstituting the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of diminishing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José pact on human rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum grant to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa says he does not regret his decision, because he did not betray his principles himself, but instead respected his "deep democratic and human rights values".
He concluded that at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish court, which has demanded that he submit to interrogation on its territory concerning an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish legislation itself allows this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked up in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
“It affects the health of anyone,” he concludes.
Correa reports that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the assignment of a safe-conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he points out that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the WikiLeaks closure.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, has launched a whole series of proceedings before different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted safe conduct as early as tomorrow, it would end".
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows, and as it has already done in other cases, interrogated Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or interrogated him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not malevolent or perverse politicians but bad journalists in the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this perspective, he welcomed that this is not the kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than highlighting his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should show firmness and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
It is necessary to solve them as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the proper resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and said it was "beneficial for Latin America to refer the matter to international forums if the two countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it is".
Referring to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to running for a third consecutive term, he noted that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primaries, he would retire from public life.
On a personal level, power has never interested me, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it will be my last presidential term and then I will retire from political life.
If we ever lose, I will too.
“This is my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s new medical treatment in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of the state of health of President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the test: HIV positive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the moment of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful," in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to inquire about it and his hardship was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and no more stigmas.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as a reference that this information was validated in a scientific publication of this year April.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of immune system affecting patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who did not use drugs at a rate of up to 50 for a CD of up to 30 years.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who would be diagnosed with HIV positive at age 25, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems until he is 75," the scientist explained.
In order to put this progress in context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of AIDS-related deaths has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to UNAIDS' annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients identified in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years at least, we have never lacked medication, the problem is that patients reach very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or else they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
He gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, we must offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who request it".
Specialists and members of the State AIDS Prevention Council of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffered from the tumour of Kaposi.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better that I blow three times a week,” they say, not me.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To this day, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of the World AIDS Day.
That they do the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
Its message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
The most important thing is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packs of a hundred, it is very good, but it results, that even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question, "What are you going to do with it?", posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents don't want to hear.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold at the counters, but that they be found in the vending machines of public toilets and in places frequented by young people.
This is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez had responded when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"That's not how sexuality works, it's best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he said.
Numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The State is the fourth-largest state in the country in terms of the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in terms of the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections occur through sexual contact, 6% through blood and 2% through perinatal contact.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for every recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a bad precedent for all domestic companies with ramifications in the neighboring country and with solvency problems.
Therefore, it seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment handed down on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s top glassmaker to sue the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the trial judge states that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says the main proceeding is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, that is to say the "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A fact omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had been facing since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, repercussing the costs in the country.
For the time being, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family company will appeal to the same appeals court for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance remedy will claim non-prosperity and require review of the trial by a higher instance, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") detailing Vitro's proceedings under the Business Bankruptcy Act, noting that this freed him from the agreements signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he pointed out that the country had complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency, which ensure fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they stun Vitro and they stun the country.

They're besieging the Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend in an amphitheatre at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society have approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the Great Wall country, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East area in order to oppose the monumental project that is partly located on protected areas and represents the largest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a requirement by the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under his ACTA English acronym, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it did well that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball globetrotter "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of the lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 90s," Reyes recalls during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball is my whole life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his unusual itinerary, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves most are those that remind him of his time as a player with the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
“It’s been my best years, the ones I’ve enjoyed the most because I’ve had the chance to compete in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
It’s been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired to the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great manager, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a strong player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
That’s how to start Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended to me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At the time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's charges on the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came in fourth and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn’t made us replay the last game, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the Le<0xC3><0xB3>n brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the World Cup of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but they gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Houruitiner replacing the players suspended by the Pan American Games imbroglio in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as did Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you need to do?
There are things I would have liked to have put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys only play in their area and only play teams from other corners of the island in the national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, passed away.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the ironic role he loved the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her press secretary Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
“He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking heavily for many years.
In 1995, he had been found to have a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and took her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film roles include critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their loved ones aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan “Who Killed J.R.?”, invented to maintain the suspense around an emotional episode in which the character of Hagman is virtually murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to charge her with prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
“I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R.,” Hagman said in 1988.
One should write, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is in the works, the channel said.
So far, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who became famous with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the stage of New York theaters in the early 1950s and served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Les memoires merciables de J.R)
“I didn’t write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to be operated on and after," he said in 1996.
I try to offer them some comfort, like, “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a little while, but it’s going to be okay.”
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing there an irresistible hook: the end of the "big count" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the coming months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal chasm that some have dubbed “the Armageddon of debt” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists thought the apocalypse would break out.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we tell it, it was a very good time.
And remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he’s not the only professor to give lectures on “the end of the world” this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled “The End of the World.”
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn’t disappear,” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the very night of the supposed end of the world,” Restall said.
The classes proved quite popular.
“It was complete in two hours,” Restall said of his high-level course for 35 students.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and infirmary student, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us they believed in the end date of the world on December 21.
“Our first project was about Maya prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” says Julie zegle, a 21-year-old Temple senior from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back centuries, that makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge in these speculations.
“In other places around the world, people don’t think about it,” he said.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that classes were being given here on "the end of the world."
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, there has been talk of the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they thought they were going to parties "at the end of the world".
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
