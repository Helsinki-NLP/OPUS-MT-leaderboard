The Prague Stock Exchange at market close had a negative crash.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
The transactions of the CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has picked up from the crash of the day before that was almost 6%.
Behind this decline is the collapse of stocks on Wall Street.
Thus, even here, there is a market reaction to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilization plan for the local financial sector.
Collapse of stocks in Asia
Asian stocks suffered a dramatic crash on Tuesday, although the indices, however, later wiped out some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day erased almost 4%, but later also a part of the losses stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8% while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange were down more than 5%, but in the end the losses were 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
“The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world,” said Hong Kong Currency Bureau Chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy on its own, so without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposed financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will also suffer the consequences.
Massacre of American Actions
The US Parliament on Monday rejected the financial system support plan, for which $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion Czech crowns) had to be allocated.
Lawmakers have ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a massacre and major stock indices recorded the biggest crash in more than two decades.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a similarly large drop was last seen in 1987.
The index was already lowering before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not being passed, it went into freefall.
Congress has caved in: the U.S. government can allocate $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of economic support agreement for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have broken the ice in the dialogue over approving the bailout in the form of economic aid to the U.S. financial system totaling $700 million (nearly 12 trillion kroner).
But it is not yet said.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
The president of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters on Sunday.
In the Senate, according to some sources, one could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor that can awaken the financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, the aid of the markets can be obtained.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
“We have taken a big step forward.”
“We have clarified our differing views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers’ delegates met late Saturday and Sunday with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give final shape to the government’s financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead to serious losses for financial companies and jeopardize the stability of the entire system.
“We are completing the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.”
“We still need to carry out the recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on stock markets that are collapsing sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
That is to say, they want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of Congress.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Houses of Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount envisaged for system support shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has demanded.
But Congress can block allocating the rest of the sum in case it gets the impression that the program is not performing its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the 350 finals.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President can veto this decision, Congress can overwhelm his right to veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, namely to get finances to buy passive mortgage securities, the price of which has collapsed because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
“We have processed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," as the Republican senator mentioned.
US President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush is pleased with Saturday’s positive performance and appreciates “the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of gold parachutes
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief spokesman, said lawmakers had agreed on responsibility for the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the balance sheet of reductions, splitting the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called golden parachutes for executives of companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard and we’ve made a big step forward towards the deal that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans as well,” Paulson said.
The plan relies on helping homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new installments of the mortgages it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly expenses on installments for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive in how the losses will be divided between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
“Most importantly, Congressional representatives will agree to support this plan this week and name it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this moment more important,” Marek stressed.
Duel to the Last Blood: MP3 Players vs. Cellphones
We will advise how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
However, there are many reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this there is not even an objective reason.
If, however, hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyl is crowded on your shelves, at least you dream of such a turntable.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns for a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digests the market’s twenty crown headphones.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It is the battery life that decides.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just play music, but they don’t do it by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as the mobile phone.
Besides the primary functions, phone and text, it can read music and videos, record both and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe it can even navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and handhelds you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle that no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on the mobile phone and first the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
Reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap cell phones don’t count that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add, from time to time, a few calls, get another charger to work for safety, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours at continuous functionality with a charge.
Another problem is when you download music to your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without an adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, with a few exceptions (iPods), do not need any special software.
Simply fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players create themselves a multimedia library sorted by the names of the performers, album name, genre or by the user's classification.
Some devices reproduce only the tree structure of the folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, be especially interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly ease of use.
If you need music above all from the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you just need any cell phone that plays MP3.
This is clearly happening on any mobile phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about which formats your phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by the company Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument to buy a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is poor and is usually limited to hits of the moment of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phones behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to a little snoop in their pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every mobile phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than 3,000 kroner.
For 3,000 and 4,000 crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an input for common headphones.
The best and most technically equipped mobile phones and also with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15,000 crowns.
Instead, the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) we really do it anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or maybe the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally bumping into the start-up of the mobile internet network and consequently a giant bill for data transmission.
What device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2 type, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, you fall within the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service so it comes close to the same MP3 player.
In this area Sony Ericsson has come a long way, which mobile phones of the walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, generally up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Possibly
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing here – a virtual operator that forces traditional operators to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be missing for a long time.
Of the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
After all, <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> also confirmed this, pointing out that the price of SMS is higher for us than for the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regularisation of roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in relation to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking the competition that would really like to start the clash.
Perhaps it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage highly above 100%.
Mobile telephony operators, on the other hand, like to complain about the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense he also often emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network no longer probably has many possibilities. (Moreover, perhaps it would be difficult now to find other frequencies).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a significant drop in prices, to which then the traditional operators should have reacted.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar rumors were echoing in Britain as we did.
However, it has been shown that the place for operators of this kind exists and that they can be really successful.
After all, for example, we don’t have to go very far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator has managed to win over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta to which U:fon belongs in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry back, that is, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the offer of the narrowest services
So for example Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that cost at least half compared to its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move to bet on a target group as well.
This operator focuses, so to speak, specifically on men.
"Real men choose Mobilking operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company who produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept can be asserted here as in Poland.
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of services it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"There is talk of the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have much expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will take place rather in the other countries of our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, the press spokesman of the financial group Penta, said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz.
Thus he indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not very supportive of this thought.
Rather, they try to do everything so that you don’t create any potential competitors.
For some time she has not hidden her interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefonika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner it is done, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already managed to make progress in negotiations with some of them," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator we will have perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nika O2 press section mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also used by other operators.
T-Mobil press spokesman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both of us, on which it is possible to continue to build."
“On the T-Mobil network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point we will have to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon.”
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of the customers, the most productive.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Competent authorities - with accomplices
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around the U:fon creation testify that when operators care about one thing they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> during the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to the information of public access from the web pages of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for which not to accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> commented: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has been little enhanced with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Regarding the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place on him and especially on his high demands services.
The attitude of mobile operators is surprising, however, the complete lack of interest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not only the attitude of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> that unfortunately in the Czech Republic – unlike Great Britain and other developed countries – has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, has taken on its typical position with regard to the whole problem.
"The virtual operator's entry into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the lease agreement for the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer from potential buyers has probably not been attractive enough for traditional operators," said Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS External Relations Section in the answer to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
Instead of the office that has to defend the interest of consumers and, moreover, deal with the fact that no one takes advantage of its position in the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: “Abroad where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services.”
But obviously the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices are not in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost emotional harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence arises on its own.
Just as the identical price of gasoline for all petrol stations is the result of coincidence and competition.
"The section has not found any signs of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No trader has a dominant position, so he has no corresponding greater responsibility for his behavior on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be lacking for the telecoms regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many controversial points.
Of course, there is <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s analysis of the relevant markets, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, no Czech trader has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator the agreement of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator, logically, has a monopoly on its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a little alarming that three mobile operators proceed in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS is kept out of the whole thing.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the update of the recently approved telecommunications law, despite the fact that, from this, many experts expected the situation to improve.
This fact the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
You can do it when no one is watching.
While without us noticing it remains the operation of such pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are even some in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only pre-established people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company towards the operator is listed as a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major customer you then receive special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar pre-sales.
"If the cases you are talking about, which we will be interested in, could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and could result in the conclusion of cooperation with this company," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> answered the question in question.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
In other words, they derive a profit from the activity of these companies and at the same time – unlike the real virtual operators – they are not harmed in any way by their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the regular customers of mobile operators.
But that should be a little strange at <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, there is another issue for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes in the face of such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where operators were born, traditional operators were more or less trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - market too small, to the limit too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in developed countries, in these cases, the regulatory bodies have intervened in defense not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then came the creation of the first virtual operator and others joined him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing the whole case from one to the other like a boiling potato.
From our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes it more than comfortable.
But let's not throw in the towel.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator will really appear soon, the Czech mobile market will start again.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only <0xC3><0x9A>OHS could hardly remain impassive to the rejection (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, choir pitch and instrumental edition.
The song is conducted by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the anthem are Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already before he told the radio "<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas" that he has specially chosen to sing solo variants, singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
“From the beginning I tried to make sure that both of them, and also the choir, have a clear diction, that the text is understandable, that they are in harmony,” he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j" was first played in 1834 on the stage of Stavovskéh divadlo in the original work Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
The MHD Wednesday in Prague will also accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers who will have an electronic card in place of the paper ticket will board the metro, tram and bus.
At the moment, about 100,000 people who have their own Opencard can get it.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day and annual ticket (starting January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged at the Infopoints and the offices of the Transport Company and at the metro station Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>rada and Koby.
The coupons can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet on the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was taken advantage of by more than four hundred customers before the afternoon.
Those who start using the internet service can completely forget the counters at the metro stations where until now they had to make long lines for paper tickets.
The coupon is purchased via the internet and on the Opencard they reload it on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a desk with trained staff that will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also record on their card the credit acquired," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to upload the electronic vouchers on the Opencards in ATM and self-service that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they resemble ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1> metro stops.
“There are now five in the whole city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,” Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> concluded.
The coupon will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Simply insert the Opencard card and upon payment of the coupon, it will be charged on it.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
“In the trains added to Prague’s integrated transport system there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they check the validity of the time and zone,” explained the way Filip tickets are checked by the Ropid organisation, which sets the timetables for Prague’s collective transport.
City buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s checkout.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the determined point next to the cashier.
Thus the driver checks the validity of the loaded coupons.
“If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information,” Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who take city buses and will not remember, when the validity of the voucher expires, can go again to the self-service ATMs, where they load the vouchers on the card.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the United States.
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include <0xC5><0xA0>umava in the United States.
This is the result of the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States at least.
With this desire, according to what is said, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned in 1945 to the president of the United States.
This is most evident from the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the “<0xC5><0xA0>umava district” – occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia again.
“We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units will arrive in German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “The people who care about the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava with all their heart.”
Because, they say, the annexation of Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives Sudeten Germans only hope for brutality, lack of regard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the <0xC5><0xA0>umava protectorate now and always.
“We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and uproots ethnic minorities and has not contributed at all, at all, to the victory of the Allies,” the letter states.
The reason why the perpetrators cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge on the part of the “Czech oppressors”.
If the president of the United States should doubt the conviction of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would be enough to organize in the district a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the control of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to in the least guess that it would be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten peoples.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German from Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the Baltic Sea maritime power.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the prison camp at Hol<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n, dozens of other Czech Germans went to visit him for him to teach him Czech.
“They thought that once he came home the Czech would make him feel comfortable,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia during the war, according to him relied on the fact that on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
You don't think you'll pay!
The Emotional Campaign Will Attack Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, we could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to start on Wednesday.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek's office expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour at the wheel.
The 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put on his belt before he leaves.
It wants to touch in conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
What will appear in the commercials?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this is also witnessed by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you will pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his own life.
The commercials will “shock” viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It promises to bring down the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
“With drivers the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of fine or accident.
You have to remind drivers of the risk," says Transport Ministry psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n of Na Homolce Hospital.
And so it takes information campaigns in the press and especially negative publicity, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the signs that warn drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed warning panel has been installed, it will probably soon become confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Israeli Provisional Government Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
“We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will have to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli zones), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual restitution would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the screeds or planers to pass over him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which lie within the Old City.
“He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he said.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was the prerequisite for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan," he warned.
“The Syrians know what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shia movement); they will have to give up the permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism, Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq,” he said.
Questions after the accident: Are bus stewards illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you cannot walk on the bus that makes long distance routes
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua, the student agency bus company has come up with the question of whether the stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the ride.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident last week that killed a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less safe place of the bus at the time, despite the fact that there were still two other seats allocated.
But the bus can make an accident or brake sharply even when distributing coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the registration form.
If it is not approved, passengers must be seated.
The buses of Student Agency have no standing places, confirmed to the website Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x95>.cz the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
“We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the ride if they have the assigned seat," he said.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role.”
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from carrying out the services.
The road traffic law recognizes only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," Hanzelka added.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> believes, however, that the law takes care of this problem enough.
Depends on whether the bus has approved standing seats.
That's all," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban where there are standing places and the maximum speed limited, interurban with standing places with maximum speed higher and long distance without standing places with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet ride there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on planes.
It’s not even safe there when turbulence comes and the flight attendant can hit his head.”
"If the bus brakes sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Same as in the city bus or tram.
The transport company must solve the safety of the stewards with a internal regulation," he says and also intends that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to suspend the services.
The Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of the stewards.
This one takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their job dangerous.
“As soon as I feel like I have to consider the job of the steward as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they board.
It would also reduce costs,” he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who runs a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency, motivated the lack of stewards on his vehicles as an interest in safety.
“We don’t have a hostess, we oppose it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz said less than a year ago.
There was an immense tragedy.
In the accident of the line to Naples, a young hostess from the region of Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who had worked for the company for two years, died.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the coach.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sudden maneuver, but hit it with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewarts had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-distance coaches, they are inaccessible."
The company intends to report the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the court ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to specifying the movement of stewarts on board buses.
“But they have not achieved any concrete results.
Buses don’t consider them so much, they take more care of the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone while driving,” says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewarts as a major threat to the safety of passengers," said Havelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The hopes of Düsseldorf are focused on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the director of WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the capital market center of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of units of the Düsseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a “competent block” with lasting profits in such a venture.
Moreover, any such union could be a decisive impetus for further links in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is how it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity for action.
Because the afflicted WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having pointed out some time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is straining in search of a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the clients of the Savings Banks themselves already know because of their investment funds, and WestLB have certainly been talked about for quite some time, even by Frankfurt.
The head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas reported at the end of August at the time of the presentation of the turnover of the first half of the year that a merger of the house at via Mainz with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the board of directors of Deka, which is half run by regional banks and savings bank consortia, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint bargaining.
It could be market trading or parts of it.
But the conversations have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important in the Frankfurt business district, not the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings sector.
In 2003 it seemed for a short time that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
Of this association of three nothing was done.
As soon as the drafts were published, the regional bank of Hesse was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they often thought about it for a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, chairman of the Helaba board of directors, spoke out against design games to reunite with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that cognition is created, that it is necessary that the different houses of the public sector are brought closer together.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg may first occur.
For Helaba, this is not good news at all.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, partners will soon be missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far he has overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hessen-Thüringen Savings Bank Association, which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, closed the meeting with WestLB.
Only the NordLB will remain.
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand there is also the question of how the different business models of the individual houses match.
In June, Merl pointed out that the decisive question, which business model would ensure the future of regional banks, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end, the division of West LB could also come out, which on the part of that is of course not desired.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
We will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l. barrel of the brand Kaiser stands a massive bearded and shows the approximately 200 travelers what deep tones it can produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a pat and then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to the Porta Nuova station, four couriers depart this evening at 23.45 with destination Munich, Beer Festival" , expected arrival at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another they only travel Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It’s so noisy, Marco says, that it’s not something for Italians.
Marco who wears a long coat with faux fur lining and a pair of glasses with wide silver splints belong to the buses.
They have been going to the Oktoberfest for 5 years, this year there are 3 tours.
The departure at night, during the day to the party, return at 10.30.
Staying overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with Kaiser beer, made according to the rules of Bavarian genuineness, the health insurance and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better yet, they will still need their strength.
They stop at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 a.m. at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others regroup, Marco explains for the last time the program of attack.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent it means running!", quotes Marco early in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, but we block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, divide into the adjacent space!"
The mug costs 8.25 Euro, Marco shouts.
And don't forget to tip.
"To show the security service that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they disappear!"
Third: "Tonight at 10.30 p.m. we'll meet again here! Understand?"
We're leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as you follow away the yellow caps to the trees, to the street signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as "Italian weekend".
Exact data does not exist, we talk about 50,000, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police of Munich are reinforced with 7 South Tyrol agents, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic on nationalities, where the Italians are in first place with 200 medical treatments in front of the British (about 60 medical treatments) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned, that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started over the weekend.
The real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turmoil.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday that the support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested part.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the affiliate Depfa.
The state lender, according to a newspaper article, has refinanced itself in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserves were reduced by 95% to 2.37 million euros, while its share of equity also fell from 1.6 to 1.45 million euros.
Current income and net income from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared to last year, profits from both demand increases and certain shares as well as the liquidation of loan provisions fell by more than 70% on the 5 million euro.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the repayment of subordinated compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and from the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 had lost himself in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were split into Aareal Bank.
Given that income in the classic state financing was too low, Depfa has been more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate now has to amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group’s profit and loss account.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is a major state and infrastructure lender.
It is more dependent on market refinancing between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the lending between banks has largely dried up, because the banks accumulate liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually needs refinancing resources for a portion of Depfa’s credit portfolio – about 50 billion – in the short term.
According to the notice of Hypo Real Estate the financial needs of the group were covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of the mostly non-functioning international money markets.
From other sources we hear, that thanks to the money the refinancing is assured until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the contrary, said that the HRE group will not need money markets anytime soon.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE group is still assured.
This is hoped for the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
The funding may not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank, as it was learned, was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the spirits.
The stock price fell by 75% to 3.30 Euro.
They're pretty good at mortgage rates.
While debts of anterior degree are almost immovable, the courses of deferred credits give way.
The most affected are the mortgages of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo, understandably the beginnings with a maturity beyond 2009.
Before HRE loans seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and of the institution itself, which with the relief of the Depfa has worsened the crisis.
As long as the least damaged central banks, governments and banks are still ready, one can count on an amortization of annualities within the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, which no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But when it comes to information overturned due to partial statizations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will mostly create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to split from their commitments.
Short-term investors can conclude the carry-over of losses for future capital gains compensatory tax payments.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop, the first day of school, is due to show up at Tachibana High School, the girls start giggling: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Trade Log tells of Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had a crush on going to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road on my own and luckily I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the first hour of the lesson does not seem to have been fixed as by us in Lower Saxony.
Schoolchildren arrive slowly from 8:00 a.m. until 8:40 a.m. begins a brief interview with the professor, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who speaks in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old host mother's skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I stood in front of the chair and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, chuckled and waved and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I knew her from my mangas.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls to survive and means "cute, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me grinned, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the class had continued quietly, but when the gong played, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They were all talking and laughing and teasing me with questions – then it’s really hard to understand the Japanese’s English.
In the pause everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the basket for Lunch- it is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu..
I don’t even know what I eat in Japan.
Things seem strange and taste completely new.
Fact is, that everything is really good.
Maybe except for the salted plums, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a self-made Bento, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of then getting to know the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious, if I can find out.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
I have been reading Mangas for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn a bit of the Japanese language.
I was completely convinced that I would come here once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care a lot about us here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends – on the other hand: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen in my life.”
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach runs away when they feel the danger. Does that mean that they also feel the fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it be verified if, when they behave in the same way as we do, they have the same feelings as we do?
For some years now, articles by well-known scientists have been published in the Internet newspaper "Edge".
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impractical territory, because the base of reference does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do, that is, it pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to transmit our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human awareness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide zone is much more developed than in the other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the basis is thus admitted on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should appear in the way man speaks: since much of life is linked to language, it is often said to be linked to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the animal’s awareness, as it is done, surely differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through one's own experience because of the special hardware, their research will pose great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would be easier to access.
One could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies of the short memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, we move first to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
So what does it mean for feelings?
I impute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies working memory.
Seen in this way, the feelings are closely related to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With the speaking nature subtle nuances of feeling are created, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings result from more primitive activity of the regions of the body of the sensations of the cortex and the paleocephalus, similarly to Jack Pankseep, who however focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict it, but I consider it indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and humans as fear is likely to be felt by the senses in both cases: but how could it be, if rats and humans experience the same thing when they behave similarly?
A cockroach in case of danger runs away as if he too felt the fear?
In my eyes the mere resemblance of behavior can yet prove no vital resemblance.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalies, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleobrain responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to humans: how would you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, here there is progress at the neural level, as long as the same procedure is renounced on rats and men.
As I don’t do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t do research on their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually bang against a wall.
I am a practical emotional one.
UEFA President Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
Both host countries lame in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stadiums to be used by Europeans will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to work as fast as possible," Ukrainian association president Grigory Surkis said.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer."
Numerous members of the first division only in the last season were convicted of manipulation, in the end it was even necessary to postpone to the last moment the beginning of the League.
Dennis Quaid indignant
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now he has a lot to do with the former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared her former Dennis Quaid an adulterer.
He foams of anger and strikes back.
Delayed Roses War for ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors now quarrel with each other over a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for marriage failure: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the treachery you would only come to know after the separation.
The occasion for the “soul stripper” was Ryan’s press work on her new film “The Women” – the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to her being publicly declared an adulterous husband was clear: it would be “unheard of,” the 54-year-old told the “New York Daily News,” that “Meg for the umpteenth time repeats and reworks the history of our relationship.”
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, again "be publicly reminded of the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from the split lives alone, Quaid is married again and will soon become the father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrow: "My life goes on in any case.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that has everything going for the best.”
Prices for airline tickets and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and hotel overnight stays have again become more affordable - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter saw a noticeable decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already at 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees as the reason for this the weak dollar quote, which would have led to a "calling desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centers such as Frankfurt and London would also be hit by the hotel price recession more than industrial centers such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter is still up:
Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June, prices for Economy Class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but price changes in First Class and Business were far weaker.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9 %, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 %.
As for domestic German flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price crash would be on the one hand the downward economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, because of the agreement on open skies, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, there would be increased competition pressure.
A sign of the crisis would be the suppression of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that would have declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
At Borussia Luhukay he still can’t find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the lucky landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first came into the game late and failed with a shot on the crossbar
His message was precisely formulated, it passed on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right
“We need the second goal,” exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the hallway of the Hamburg arena.
It had not happened much in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of them sat back in their place.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for almost 3 decades, enjoying an even greater esteem than certain old players.
And so his admonition also found hearing in the higher spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have played in a similar way: here is the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
“Not everything here has been nice to see today,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have been "more relaxed".
For the 1 to zero Hamburgers have to thank Mladen Petric's header (11) and the fact that the many weak players in Gladbach could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
“It was a dirty win,” Martin Jol said.
The SV Hamburg on Monday will be 121 years old.
Spectators have already celebrated before, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which has legitimized their sporting society as before the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We’re able to put everything right,” said Marcell Jansen.
He has a feeling, that the provisional certificate from the table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new late arrivals – Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric goal as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern – finds itself slowly, but has not yet managed to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling,” Jol says.
After the defeat of the vote
In Wall Street there is fear.
The first reports of the failure of the rescue package temporarily collapsed the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the one-day space in its history.
Later the Down recovered a little bit again.
Around 20:30, the world’s leading stock exchange barometer traded/detected with a good 5% shortfall on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange stood firm with a deficit of more than 7% out of 1548 points
The biggest loser at that time was the Dow American Express, which gave us just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do it.
The shares of Goldman Sachs fell by just 10 percent.
Only a few days earlier the great investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
As part of the rescue plan, the financial funds for the hoarding of so-called mortgage documents had to be allocated
The sum must be paid, however, not in a stroke, but in degrees.
By referral the State had to keep the Aktienoptionsscheine of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with an adequate course of quotations , to reduce the charge to the state funds.
The stock price in Europe and the USA in the downward vortex
The billions in aid for banks in Europe and the US do not erase investor doubts.
The stock price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate falls sharply and tears the German stock market index downwards
The U.S. Dow Jones Index is settling down despite the planned bailout of the financial market through the state.
Spectacular loss of the course of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have pulled the index of the German stock market into deep deficit.
The shares of the Munich real estate lender have lost despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks temporarily 3 quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank has ceded more than 20%.
The index of the German stock exchange DAX slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is quoted with a deficit of 3.7% out of 5,839 points.
The global stock markets are falling to their knees.
In New York Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors have feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package may not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost in the first hour of business 334 points or 3.3% out of 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate could follow the first of October.
The other European stock exchanges were only able to move in one direction: in London the FTSE index has so far fallen by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Nikkei benchmark after initial profits was 1.26 % short of 11,743.61 payers.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins’ general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has flown through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fast-freezing fuel pipes, death by freezing now looms over her.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of the Swing-by
Swing-by is a manoeuvre of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/push/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical device as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What astonishes scholars for years: rockets do not behave completely as would be expected under the law of gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the anomaly of Swing-by.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton believes as firmly as before that Einstein did not make a mistake, and tries to explain the anomaly of Swing-by by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
“The responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter that could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about 10 years.
From her comes evidently a force of attraction, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is shown.
Instead, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation whatsoever, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter makes up at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
Kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a pre-release shooting, six kidnappers were found to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released
We are looking at their state of health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The backstory of a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear, so the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the end of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army unexpectedly killed 6 of them.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It would have been "still just a matter of taking the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot and killed 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of 6 million euros from Germany; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release women hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
The abuses of the stepfather "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather have led to a woman killing herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise molested and blindfolded her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Ms. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle’s friends, who had been a great surfer and cyclist, had been “emotionally dead,” and that she had “dipped with life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She is believed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: “I tied and bandaged her.”
"I didn't sexually molest her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when you were only seven years old.
“This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended up in front of the court."
I notice the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother describe having had on their daughter over the years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy successful young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office official who left top-secret documents on a train in June is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was away from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
“They would have thought that this was being dealt with internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause that concerns the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qa'aeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of over <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the bailout of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has given 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take money from savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) general manager Adrian Coles said it was “irritating” that companies and their members have to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14bn loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the construction company association, told the BBC he believes it is unfair.
“It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the home market are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been far less prudent.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant bill,” Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk rises to 5 pennies per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five pennies per litre by Monday.
It’s the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves if they want to dump the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many corruption charges hanging against you.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is expected in the coming weeks but her party, the Awami League, has called for the country’s military-backed temporary government to give her full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on parole, it is unclear under the terms of her release, whether she will be free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The high court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina on the grounds that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical treatment," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government seized power, but was released in June, to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan anti-polio campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign because of violence related to the Taliban, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it cannot reach the children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this was despite promises by the Taliban that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission’s decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeals court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation impeded competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin CEO Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom’s regulator objected to the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special public prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was sparked by fears that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Series of allegations concerning potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or substantiated,” said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the fired lawyers had not been rated worse than so many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was politically motivated.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the lawsuit against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against Democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and pursue lawsuits in court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for dismissals, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officers resigned.
(The Inspector General’s report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the case, saying he held a primary responsibility in dismissals, had abdicated his leadership role, and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officers, including Bush’s former senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold award at next week’s ceremony in London, said he was “honoured” to earn the recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the track title of Meat Loaf's 1977 album hit.
Coldplay will lead nominations for this year’s awards, being on the nominee list in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loafs.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album remained in the charts for almost nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf – real name Marvin Lee Aday – has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an operation for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossroads, some famous, others merely of use.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and long-time residents find it difficult to give Extra Place’s location, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and goes north from the First Road – without taking the Second Road – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy street.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The road, however, must have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the newly built luxury buildings on First Road.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include long-time neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the stately neighborhood of the past.
But the city’s preservation and development department, which has control of the streets, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the land use committee of the district municipal commission some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director for Community Board 3.
“There’s very little space left for the city’s ownership, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,” he said.
“There could be proposals to fix and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access.”
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that it wanted to reopen the small street and install seats, including some to use for a café to which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main concern is to renovate this cul-de-sac and turn it into a public amenity,” he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said it was indeed the city’s desire to sell the road and noted that the agency’s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous sons and the narrow strip of land was not reclaimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
“The terrain was beautiful,” said Danny Fields, the Ramones’ manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, scraps of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers writing about “gentrification” of the East Village, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of almost nothing changed city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Little Nostalgic Look at the Endangered City"), published part of a Discourse on the History of the City that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, dead-end alley, dark even by day and bounded by rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows, with week-old newspapers fluttering along the slums."
With a few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran nimbly through the back of the street near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti, and an empty 22-ounce beer bottle lay next to a group of cool abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby have said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest it would need to be a little embellished.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “were in black, dirty, disgusting places.”
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior fellow in California studies and the senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School.”
Attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Obama’s campaign notes that, “African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama’s education plan specifically supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English learners.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom teaching of languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The school’s students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth graders, an astonishing 100 percent of students took the top-level test in the 2008 math state exam.
An equally astonishing 93 percent of fourth graders took the expert-level test on art-of-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient from the one Mr. Obama preferred.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant assessment of skills, and an "no excuses" attitude.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s obstructive approach to English students is “full immersion.”
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We had a fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you would not have been able to pinpoint which one it was.”
"It works," he observed, "for us it works."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Spanish-majority schools with English students?
The school’s achievements make the answer to that question very easy, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Association is a long-time proponent of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevents predicting Mr. Obama’s answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the topic trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about “English-only” legislation.
Instead, he said, “you have to make sure your children are able to speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than scorn or trivialize them.
Oil falls sharply and economic fear renews
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the U.S. bailout for financial markets may not be able to lift the economy.
Crude futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in morning trading.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street’s financial turmoil, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plummeted to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before climbing back up again amid tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety affected investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend negotiations had led to a bailout deal "seem to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to ease.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape contagion.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for the coming year as oil consumption home due to slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time in the Jets uniform than anyone else in the past eight or more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals matched the grayness of the menacing clouds overhead with a dim play.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tuning took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
“I didn’t get out of my path,” Favre said of all the passes that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people might think."
While Favre and Coles played catching games, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner hard.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a roaming pitch and re-launched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fumble.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals went ahead of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had picked up the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, for a 34-0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets conceded 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Rested Gebrselassie breaks his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathoner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile run under the 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a favorablely flat race win in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered his previous score of 2:03:26 last year in Berlin for 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record for a career so stunning that it produced a world championship or a world record at any distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at start, 55 degrees at finish - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a scorching average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-skiers like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went the long distances, the marathon record has fallen more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had calf cramps and missed a week of training.
Clearly, rest left it cool, not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well.”
He has been a bit criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival – for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars, relying on the forecourt as if it were a half-bottom race, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie’s competencies as a marathon runner.
With the pace cadenced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, competed in Gebrselassie after the forecourts vanished.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final spike to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best time by nearly 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German national, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but was cured to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing her calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a large detachment, picking them up after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Tucked away in the expansive theme park on the outskirts of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the enormous, lies the quiet city where pride and the complications of the African-American experience come into life.
Eatonville, the first all-black town incorporated into the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as he described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, Harlem Renaissance’s most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city he described — and which makes tourists stop by understanding it in the Florida tour guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project — remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that "knowing so little of us, he doesn't know what's missing."
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, was called up for an opening speech on race, many here remain wary of the outsider’s gaze.
“We are very cautious about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and a member of the city’s oldest church.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical black power grab model and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of rural culture of the blacks of the south - sometimes disdainful, sometimes rewarded - born from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really began with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Rout 17, a road that runs through the often-forgotten center of Florida into a backdrop of black history and human drama.
Low in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out the street to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white trim, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passing rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this was not Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
“Zora said it like it was,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s girls whom Hurston immortalizes by citing men singing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family moving to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that when Hurston was in the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts of decent clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, Mr. Franklin says, while others were sighing.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging in his chair on the patio at the back above Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no great conference.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a 2003 biography of Hurston.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando’s expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 across the city’s western boundary.
The proposal came as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had ended the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community's front door.
“During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at people sitting on one side,” says Mr. Franklin.
“We actually had a girl who got killed by that one time.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor to my race."
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, despite being positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville’s cohesion and jeopardizes the confidence of its youth.
“Black kids were used to being hugged — I remember this — hugging your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher -- I mean, there's a cultural division there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines such as: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to Hurston’s license plateless grave and began fighting for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway's acclaimed Hurston biography hit bookstore shelves, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had again caught the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state backed away from its street project.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the city’s self-image.
Those from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the public record in 1998.
A new single-storey bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a side street in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to search for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, some things — such as the murals on Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man, which show black men in the fields — are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a plump teacher with a soft spot for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of citizen pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and proud, creative, hardworking, silly and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, which he said might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"A lot of people, if they just walked in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said after Mass on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a pretty city.”
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stalls and the huge television screens of Times Square, they wouldn’t notice being in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that glass offices, nestled above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York City are living every day the worst “bad day in the office” since the collapse of 1929.
The porters shake metal carts for tea through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken ironed shirts hanging from a cane on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 on a working day.
It didn’t seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had planned it to coincide with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desk, to collect money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "trusted banker", were in line for the same reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken the savings from smaller banks in places where commuters do business, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken the money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit unions and types of city savings banks whose branches only operate within a state, and they say they treat customers like family.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and while New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The employees and clerks standing in front of me, fearful of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
The common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank gone bankrupt, and its emaciated general manager Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge, almost fifty years old from my condo, has changed the subject from our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry road signs like those representing mosques with a red line passing in the middle.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties earned a lot in national general elections.
More than 90 graves were badly damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations driven by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is related in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which occurred towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria has meanwhile embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have campaigned with vehement anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans have been defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burqas and also voiced his opposition to foods that are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming they are political symbols of a continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the nation’s strongest political bloc, indicate that change was brought about predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Forbidden trip abroad to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to go to Spain via France.
The travel ban was granted to Kent police last Thursday after they provided prosecutors with evidence of Glitter's previous arrests for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the court hearing in Ashford, Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford Praetorian Court, Kent Police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the sex offender registry.
He must report to the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police seven days’ notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authorities may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or Glitter’s possible movements in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have the right comprehensive systems to manage any potential risks more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of convicted sex offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter came he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not pass him to passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities refused to let him in and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge prefecture, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him in the register of sex offenders.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source at the Interior Ministry said Jacqui Smith, the secretary of the Interior, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master far from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no ruffles, no old clothes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments far from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they must not go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots with singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser-known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, which is growing every day," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" they could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists who can convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
Because their personality and character are inner.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With a passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and the material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not the dancing, the singing or the playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
His passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love portraying people, getting to know them and being able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think portraiture is the hardest genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters you sometimes don’t even know or who only give you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concretize my ideas.”
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, at number 20 of via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "chance"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in Congo and has crossed the Amazon.
Always a favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a risk" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I would not write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens’ book “Our mutual friend” filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer has found himself in front of an audience to which he has flown the memory of Victor and his work, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humour, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "to live beyond what I lived", as he writes in "Alexander".
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," underlined Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "it makes people more unconventional."
The weather hinders the Festival of Pozoblanco, depriving him of the runs
The celebration of the bullfights that were supposed to seal the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the bullfights had verified that the soil conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, has decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The weather has hardened against this Festival preventing it from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bullfight.
On the billboard were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who would face a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting off three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having bullfighted with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two runs collecting greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by virtue of the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, he earned the whistles of much of the public.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish passes the checkpoint in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
The agents call the Alt to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping, flee.
Officers subpoenaed the Alt to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping fled.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents, after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years, identified as A.A.J., according to the statement of the Interior Department of the Basque government.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The accident occurred when some officials of the Alava road were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, violating orders, accelerated sharply and passed the checkpoint.
Officers chased each other until the vehicle, after a couple of miles, stopped on the side of the road and its two occupants fled to a wooded area.
The Ertzaintza agents then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took note once they inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish loaves, which were in the back of the vehicle, were later placed in police custody for in-depth investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since officials found that the matriculation had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with that reported in the van's documentation, the arrestee was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
Prisoner A.A.J., 28, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving on Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda from the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her performing risky maneuvers as she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California streetcar.
The witness specified that around 4:30 p.m. the Locklear "knocked the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to take the car out of the parking lot with sharp maneuvers back and forth.
Soon after, the witness, who at first glance apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby street and had exited the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was concerned about Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, he found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed confused," and for this reason agents took her to a specialized drug and alcohol testing center to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was collaborative and the excess alcohol hypothesis was discarded from the outset, although "as noted by officers at first, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was rehabilitated from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of the formation to make a decision on the case of the former councilor for Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of patronage.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt regarding what has been until now an aide in the Seville council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigations to have maximum transparency."
He also pointed out that the training is regulated by “very strict ethical codes for all public offices.”
"Sangre de mayo", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Episodios Nacionales by Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, Jose Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD> repeats in Sangre de mayo the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a leading a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s's literature, Jose Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD> claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before shooting a commemorative film for the second centenary of the 2nd of May in Medrile<0xC3><0xB1>o. The director had accepted provided that the story was based on the novel Episodios.
The 15 million budgets allocated entirely by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate sets and customs to portray a "bewildered Spain that misguided the choice of leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII."
However, the director regrets not having received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes foreseen by the set design that he had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver a beginne, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the work of the director lies in going to the theater and to the cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the performers, some of whom are in the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his machine, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos - do not represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "that should instead be known."
From this film Garci does not expect awards.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize you’re only working for prosperity, and at some point you’re content to just shoot an extra film,” explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Sevillan essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer pays homage to another dancer equally from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with her family to London.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and pioneered female emancipation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this character. It seemed incredible."
The dancer says: "We do not pretend to tell her whole life, but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested to me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic,” she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as face in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been her student.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I’m happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about that.”
The set also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussions of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez "who played the role of eternal accompanist of these artists who have always been spay and all round.
In the work there is also in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, usually, she resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her, because I think she is one of the women who has had a huge influence in a given historical period and now nobody remembers her and much less considers her work as something of value,” Bayon said.
The show will begin today, at 8.30 pm at the theater of Lope de Vega.
With the publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" the Triennium also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Poet Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Department of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized for the anniversary of the 50th anniversary.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel house-museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia with New York, is expected to arrive
In addition, the Department of Culture of the Andalusian Government has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Poet Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the highest value Andalusian poets.
America likes it a little less without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman left.
It took him a long time to give him an Oscar.
Since 2007 he has been retired.
It was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died in a particularly dark moment, from fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on the ground, desperately seeking new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so hard, men are so devoid of virtue and people to admire, you don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone it embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and won cases, from the anti-drug foundation created in honor of the first-born dead of an overdose to the creation of the brand of homemade and organic food.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without regard for nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that no man died, an era is over.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
“He has set a very high standard example for all of us,” says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for rectitude and to have a serious and private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some try, and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful although he certainly did not miss the opportunities to not be.
"Why am I going out to eat hamburgers today, if I have a steak in the house?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, something not so common in America.
“Among all the great roles he played, no one was as proud of him as he was of a devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather, and passionate philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race," but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if later taken into account in the evaluation and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the dorsal, which assumed that you would go earlier.
It didn’t sound like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, it’s to pick everything up (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, I don't.
You had to go just to get the dorsal (first nonsense, go only for that) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they only had T-shirts size 'S' (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are insignificant compared to the day of the race itself.
In addition to having to go very early to pick up the chip, the waiting queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race expected by more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race began that we had not even yet deposited the backpack, although, once successful in the venture, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even result in the ranking in the correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, did not register the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it will certainly not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented a preview of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company's campus) assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group those present into conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be at her disposal shortly.
All without a blue screen.
Awesome.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for “the least”.
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
Perform the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You take your computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and spend more time daily surfing the web than in a remote windowed environment.
What are half the applications of the operating system used for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services into a viable alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and here is a small example.
I took the picture in this post at one of Microsoft’s employee recreation facilities in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soda machine a sign prompts them to use their own search tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to search online.
Last week, it was confirmed the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be put on the market in early 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shined in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the uniform typical of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the strongman with the sharp mustache lifting the weights in the traveling circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's t-shirt, with the cotton interior, tight and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as English speakers call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the t-shirt carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not only about the famous "tanks".
It also includes sweatshirts for college, retro boxer shorts, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marinara shirts, baby dolls, mini shorts...
Underwear designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to wear them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new business in the fashion field very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities lending their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango firm made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, it conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let’s say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the 50s and 60s, from here we derive various inspirations.
Then, I love getting lost in the city and watching how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it often.
Dancer, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, even if in the end it all comes together and there are many elements in common.
When I was a child, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to browse my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dressing.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to essays, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you are given the wardrobe is the moment when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for stylists and professionalism.
Not too long ago, you turned 30, you went into crisis?
Oh, no.
Never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience of savoring life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was a child and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body is asking for it and also I want to be a young mother, this I do not want to miss.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are waiting for several films shot last year to be released in different theaters.
That's right, and I really want them out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can not always be so.
I want "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ" out.
Let's see if you like them
A few days ago, you made your runway debut with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the catwalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to attend a charity parade for her organization Women for a Better World and the clothes we showed – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned off to raise funds for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that I, who have known her for a long time, can confirm to you that they are not so true.
Besides, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to do the pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help third world women, you can't back down.
Repeated drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, install in his car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of intoxication or if it does not blow into the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since he will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
This initiative, in addition to the General Prosecutor for Road Safety, will be attended by the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Istituto Tecnologico per la Sicurezza del Automobile (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving while intoxicated then return to drive the car.
The alcoholock would avoid this, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents you from starting the car if the driver does not blow, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce up to 65% of infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviors before they become criminal offenses.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and undoubtedly the reform necessary for criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some commercial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 5.40 pm, second schedule, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced them to use their hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the principles of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the hangar of the airport crushed on the red carpet and the military cordon made up of 27 navy soldiers who offer the salute of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, hair in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps she was told that in Mexico City threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before passing in the room where the official entourage awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a humorous Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award than Paris and there is probably no more exquisite and bont vivant stylist than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango showcase at number 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Moreover, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal’s most exquisite canvases, Mango’s presidential gala table was even more spectacular.
Born, with broken heart and making of necessity virtues, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take his breath away and to the arm of his son Luis - a giant of almost two meters in height - he accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the dinner of tribute.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of home and knighthood which he finished, along with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had sold them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirts – designed by her hand – transformed herself for dinner, wearing a long black dress very sensual and got excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the room for the ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and she "plaed a big"
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the building, but she had shown us the photos of her son on her cell phone before.
The next day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez - another big guy who moves on motorcycles - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously made sure that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic everyday life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation in the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine getting caught up in the hectic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the difficulty of disengaging from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga poses, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole "menu" of options tailored to everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 Ways to Relax" and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to the publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "handbook" denies that belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as staying in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline doesn’t already flow into your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who talk while staying asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you take a scare, but it doesn’t really matter much.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquium.
It manifests itself with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once in the month ...), the day after the baby no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason for this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nighttime fears, nighttime bedwetting (peeing in bed), or sleepwalking, but this is not necessarily the case.
As already mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stressful situations or overexcitement.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that is still understudied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks in a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (shouting, screaming, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to see if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety such as outflow to the situation.
We have said that it is a benign alteration therefore there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stressful situation).
What you can do, however, is to consider a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the baby too much before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiring to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the sleep talks appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if it appears very distressed and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what it says but not see what it is dreaming to say it, so you need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it might lead.
Never tell your child that you might ask him questions during the night to learn his secrets.
Not even for a joke.
Such a thing causes enormous anguish.
In short, do not worry, it is nothing serious, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern has finally found its way home to victory after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Black-Yellows created the most net opportunities by turning one into the game win.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves with difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the guest team Kauffmann who touched the seven with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirn high, Romain high and again Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block in the center of the field, leaving only the wild Riahi at the point of attack.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the first goal of Marais for the Illhaeusern, well positioned, resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But the gunner of the Illhaeusern will not be able to savor his happiness for a long time and will be expelled a dozen minutes later thus leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, backed just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rocky action, the ball touched the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
Before the demonstration of fishermen who brutally prevented Monday access to several Breton and Norman ports, the president of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome it "with a constructive spirit" and hope that "it will present itself with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the surge in the price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president will "discuss with them about possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and to make the working conditions and remuneration of sailors safe".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le were not interrupted.
A roadblock has been put in place on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors already showed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, as demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where fishing boats remained at the pier, or to Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire Atlantic, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the well-known Total refinery in Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting that will be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give in" and "they do not intend to move to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the fisheries committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is reached only with a diesel of less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy's unforgettable performer died of cancer at the age of 83 in his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and again Sam Mendes greeted film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with the delivery of 215 aircraft, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially for aircraft in the 30-120 seat range.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, set up by U.S. monetary authorities, would divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its assets, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the newspaper said on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The AIG board of directors met on Sunday evening to consider any divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to divest include the aerial leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these divestments, FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities seize 80% of its capital.
Paris: history Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic crash on Monday, after the House of Representatives spoke out against the Paulson plan to bail out financial institutions: the Dow lost 6.98%, a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the stock exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of major technology stocks, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, according to final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the bailout of the banks, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favor, the representatives refused the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
Approximately two out of three Republicans have rejected the plan.
“It’s a negative signal sent to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this signals how much the market counted on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it may already be "too late" to adopt one.
“If the project were actually dying ... then the witness would be quickly passed to the Fed and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And further highlighting the state of emergency, “every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution,” Piegza said.
After the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities arranged for the acquisition of Wachovia’s banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging emergency intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis," added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on Treasury Bonds with a 10-year maturity fell to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday evening, while that with a 30-year maturity is at 4.161%, compared to 4.357% the previous day.
Obama takes lead in first TV duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House, here is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic campaign proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, while deserving, was not brilliant enough to allow him to curb the drop in polls five weeks into the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll released on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49 percent versus 44 percent for McCain), shows the Democrat had the upper hand.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% are betting on McCain.
An excellent performance by his teammate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm on Thursday the advantage of Obama.
“Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition,” Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his undisputed foreign policy experience, stressing the "naivety" of the opponent regarding the issues addressed during the first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that he has often stated on multiple occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president,” he said.
What has been a constant target for the Republican TV campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, pointed out that his election would represent a new future.
Without lengthening, it proved concise and precise.
He promoted his readiness for the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
“McCain never understood, unlike Obama,” he rebutted, this weekend, a democratic spot, reprimanding the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to cope with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in the rain, for an election meeting.
He hasn't even uttered the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial crisis is in favor of Obama, considered by Americans to be the most suitable person to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
“Next week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s economic insight to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic nominee, the current collapse “is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reiterating his intention to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans despite Wall Street riots, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates shunned demands centered on the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you not notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge the results of the legislative elections in advance.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening after polling stations in central Minsk square were closed to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While still waiting for the results, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "What for? They will do whatever they want, of my vote", says a boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a fine appearance before foreign observers with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and a freeze on assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the stripping of the votes," said Yuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It is a change of face," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former candidate of the opposition in the 2006 presidential elections and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case it is the executive.
If opposition deputies enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings and bills."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the organization for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the ballot.
He points out that participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has given rise to all sorts of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? Asks the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will have been at most five members of the opposition in parliament, the most suitable in power.”
The night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The meeting - The blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, it has regained the public’s trust, seriously shaken by the infected blood scandal in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a tragedy and public outcry, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, directed by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was delaying a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of devising a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its business, only 38% of people said they still have confidence in the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve blood safety and field research over the next few years, we have regained the public’s confidence,” he said before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec’s population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases of the human variant of the mad cow in Europe, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one who has been president since 1998, the year of its foundation.
“And we absolutely didn’t know if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which, when there are doubts and serious illness could result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, measures of exclusion are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that without any doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode showed us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NATs) that allow to directly recognize the presence of the virus in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have reduced the window period, from the moment the person has contracted the disease to when the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be shortened to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to detect them has thus decreased considerably.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion is detected.
I believe that today you can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover your health, says the head of the Héma-Québec board of directors.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
You have to be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continues before stressing that in addition to having safe resources, Héma-Québec must also provide enough.
“Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors, which on average makes up only 3% of Quebecers acceptable as donors.
However, all healthy people who have reached the age of 18 and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who volunteer as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is widespread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
“With this 3% we are able to maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
Cases of shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they grow older and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so hectic that it is difficult to find an hour to donate blood," says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being deposited with Héma-Québec which manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abounds blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the inclusion in the bank of our thousandth cord blood sample and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
They should start proposing them for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection practice as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - L'Impact in the semifinals
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semifinals of the Serie A qualifiers, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a decisive second quarter-final game, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90'.
After a goalless first half on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
Remember that in the first round-trip game on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thundler filled a first 3-1 in the return game by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still be in the semifinals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed later in the day.
In brief - Decisive network of Kovalev
The Canadian and his aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and collected a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab's preparatory games.
The only network signed by Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to overdo it in the first period,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation.”
Charest Point to the North
The prime minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
Following the conclusion of the Liberal Party’s general council, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc, (left), is trying to get elected in today’s by-election.
"Expanding the boundaries of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday at Levis, by means of tools with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Image Mill".
On three maxi screens, spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc. were confused.
Great means as in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the prime minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, although he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labor, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the Prime Minister's most recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but did not comment on timing or investment quotas, nor did he explain what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
At the very least, he has merely pointed out what he believes deserves a priority position: hydropower, forests, but above all the mining sector, which as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure has undergone several improvements.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "territory twice as big as France," is here, is Quebec.
It is not only here, but it is inherent in us," he insisted, as if to solicit a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold fever in Abitibi, the national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70 percent of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the press conference.
"It is a position traditionally held by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government,” he said.
“Considering climate change, we need to reassess the North,” he said of the Northwest Passage, which will be open year-round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.”
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the PQ of Ungava), have already launched the consultation of about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position, has started work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a time when "common visions will be provided."
The development of the North would, moreover, adhere to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to stand out in order to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Station into the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he resorted to another reference, conservative this time, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest said its commissioning would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will make it," he confessed to his militants, arousing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who in April claimed there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a poll in the fall, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very engaged, particularly in a Federal Council mission to China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend's General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform for nationalist resolutions, in particular of "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smooth as oil: the PLQ above all demands recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
As for the opposition, the draft of the North Plan was skeptically accepted.
PQ leader Pauline Marois dusted off the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, did not respect its application.
If he had, "we would have made progress today," Marois said alongside Jean-Talon candidate Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the government's adoption of the North Plan.
"What we hope is that all this is not simply perceived as a spectacle," said Sébastien Proulx, a substitute for Mario Dumont, returning from the holidays today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
It was Vic Toews, the former minister of the "Justice" (irony of fate) of the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor in this way a woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the entourage of the prime minister and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated a citizen detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
Please note, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are calling for the return of Omar Khadra so that he can be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely the same government that closes its eyes before torture: it cares little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We don’t realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of freedom and of “democracy,” a word that Harper never ceases to flaunt and that sounds so senseless on his lips.
We have come to a time when there is no morality: you can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until now a minority (to see what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches virtue, respect for law and order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
There's shame right here, Mr. Toews, in renouncing all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, senior vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world’s largest gold company has filed a six million dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house squatted with the intention of initiating a “transparent public debate”.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a defamation lawsuit, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely obscured by Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to hers.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the writers and the publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend a substantial sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decidedly odd weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by the practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these unequal-arms struggles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual settlement that muzzles the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to speak out again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates are usually held with an exchange of views and not with a beating.
It would therefore have been enough for the company to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and badly rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Canada Nero.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public" debate when his contempt for that same audience is quite evident?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers exclusively to the lavishly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak out.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not from the perspective of what many perceive as a kind of gag (seeking the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum urging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver’s surreal discourse, the Barrack Gold lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies en bloc the right to citation of authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are inconvenient to the richest companies in the world, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific norms as the authors of Canada Nero do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the university world, as is the public debate in Canada itself, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive complaints.
Operation – rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, representatives of the Republican and Democratic side, finally reached an agreement on the largest bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to curb the financial crisis that has been plaguing Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
It includes, in particular, checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses forfeited, as well as a right of inspection on the salaries paid to the managers of the protected companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Rep. Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an effective market deal,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the American economy and people from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
“It’s the crucial point: if we hadn’t acted in this way, inestimable disappointments and turmoil would have spilled over into the daily lives of Americans,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The time limit agreed corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Later joining the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential elections showed themselves quite in favour of the agreement, without, however, avoiding expressing their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with having added some provisions to the agreement, particularly the one that will allow owners to keep their domicile and the one inherent in the salaries intended for executives of companies covered by the state.
“When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there’s nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he said on U.S. television.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote in favor of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
“From what I’ve read, it’s something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward.”
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to repurchase with taxpayer money the doubtful, risky and unsold assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgage-at-risk (mortgage) loans, then extended to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of liquidity and the dumping of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in office who blew up the first draft of a deal last week.
It seems to have come out of that dead end since the Democrats accepted that the “toxic” asset of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision was added that, if the government were to face losses over the next five years due to such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its own balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which a further 100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of $350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in protected companies that will earn dividends in case of profit and which it can resell when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay foreclosure procedures related to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and severance payments paid to the managers of the companies involved.
As of today, the plan’s architects would like to submit it to the House of Representatives vote, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the green light.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the Republican and Democratic side.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House finance committee, told voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Not to take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed “the caucus of skeptics,” Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Laureates, have written to us to say: We ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the test of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) for the crisis of at-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
“It’s not money lost,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, they collect influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are announcing uncertain.
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British government seems to be nationalizing another bank at risk for the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take charge of all the loans currently underway at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weak point.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the spellbinding smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to real sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who passed away on Friday at the age of 83 on his Connecticut ranch from lung cancer, remains one of the last American film icons of the years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spokesman for freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the last mark of quality.
Since he was a country full of the safe made man, the Pacific War fighter, proud in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, he later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television and early cinema.
That same civil rights man was also the car driver who ranked second at the 1979 24 Hours of Mans, as well as sex symbol, though part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadows of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to the scandals of show-business, whose mystery will never be fully revealed, leave with him.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend Paul Newman’s passing was a heartbreak for moviegoers, as his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed again through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy (1969) and that boy unable to crave his fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) are confused in memory in The Cat on the Roof Burning adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep its promise.
Many more Paul Newman have gone down in history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Up Somebody Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and retaken after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute villain in the excellent Left, Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's The Spaccone (1961), Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money won him the only Oscar out of 9 nominations in 1987.
That face through the years, it was his.
Again him.
The epochs follow one another through its path.
Young people mostly know him for the cult movie Slap Shot (1977) by George Roy Hill, as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, by the Coen brothers.
The circle was closed with a final role as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Era mi Padre, in 2003.
Unlike film legends who soon left the business, Newman will remain in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its glamour, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French amateur filmmaker, called it, with a hint of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging his performances to be exaggerated.
The profession has not always been a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholic or desperate, of which he expressed scorn and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, modest sensibility.
The first time Jennifer, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, traced a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the innumerable tributes that rained down on Newman yesterday, his great friend and old comrade Robert Redford (they had starred together in The Left and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness, “His presence has made my life and this country better.”
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of Hollywood drift, is thus extinguished.
We will have seen her face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
The proceeds from those sales were, however, earmarked for his Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, instead of lying down on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said, "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
To be there was a privilege.”
And it was also a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Model citizen, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & Societies?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal trial against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and partners will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed within the framework of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecution, the money obtained from competition calls was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the carrying out of the activities through fake invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million florins, ended up partly in the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, disclosed by the investigating authorities, they have withdrawn money obtained from tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the invoice blocks were purchased at the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, while the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue the invoices, it was established among other things during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag had sent Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados.
According to the latter's confession he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for the drinks, on the model of these then invoices were prepared to be sent to the calls for competitions, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the City of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, has mainly drawn up the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of the "travel studies" of Lados was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and members in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurateur, would not all enter the restaurant together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later called Együtt in Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, is full of formal and content errors.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there overnight, however the invoice included 130 guests.
But the compilers of the imaginative invoices exaggerated when they reported Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, in whose accounting - according to the information released to the judicial authorities - the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> were not even listed.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s director, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and they showed him the invoices, he immediately realized that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and the VAT number of our company were in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons it was not even the fact that according to the invoice were accommodated a hundred people, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
Moreover, the invoice was for catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The frequent invoice compilers did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice only arranges trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with cash payment trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also shown on the invoice, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favor of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company must apply the VAT at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, while the invoice was written.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as activity carried out the transport of goods by road, as is known from the prosecution proceedings, activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition for formal defects - due to non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it was found that the invoices issued in favor of Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, of XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The falsifiers did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület ate there, precisely for this reason the curator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied having issued him that invoice.
They sent out invoices knowingly.
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezrédért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft, which is currently in liquidation, has collaborated with Zuschlag and its partners. In 2003, it provided invoices worth about 5 million florins to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület Economic Association, behind which there was no real business.
Neither movement of money because the invoices prepared were then returned, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those that are connectable with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized at the address of the general manager of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, which deals with the trade of fuel and vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of IT equipment, worth about 18 million florins.
According to the data of the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, purchased these invoices.
The general manager of this company was a Romanian to whom between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would forward documents concerning the company.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and Együtt in Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and the counter-value was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian bricklayers founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies were operational because, according to the defendant, they had not received work.
The companies were still useful because at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the founding documents of the companies, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: the Atlasz and the Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3>.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued to the various entities 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The prosecutor's office believes that Kubatov pocketed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition call.
Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Szövetség at Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért in January 2006 submitted a call for tenders for the Socialist Party's public utility T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins each but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the call.
In order to avoid this, they presented to TMA five fictitious invoices received by the Kft Works Team.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing a part of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecution, will probably report on the progress of the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the number one defendant, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
We must see if it is in his interest, it may even be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could have been offended for now as his demands to ease his conditions of imprisonment, i.e. the granting of house arrest, have so far not been met.
While perpetrators of much larger, non-compensable commercial crimes can freely walk around or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The Psychology of Excess Bidding: Why Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers are likely to spend more, overvalue the goods.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have managed to uncover the neuro-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study appeared in the journal Science men do not want to be left behind in a race such as the eBay auction, so they are willing to pay a higher price as well.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "match" at the level of the nervous system through experimental rods.
One group of volunteers played the lotto, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active brain areas of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the striatum under the cerebral cortex comes into intensive operation when you lose to the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price increase is explained by avoiding the vehement reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial tracking survey.
In this survey three groups bid against a partner under different conditions.
They told the control group what the real value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
To another group besides this they promised that in case of winning they will receive another prize of 15 dollars.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the group members would have lost the money in the event of a loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
By testing the neurologists’ hypothesis, the members of the group that played “against loss” were willing to make higher stakes than the control or “winning” group.
“These results are not deducible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These in fact so far explained the phenomena found at auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so we came to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University’s Faculty of Economics.
Hepatitis: When to see a doctor?
Nearly half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver diseases are among the leading causes of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients is one hundred thousand, of which only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name for contagious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. infected food and water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For those who travel, it is useful to get vaccinated against the A and B virus, against C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots form on the skin and the whites of the eyes, the stools become light and the urine dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not know they have contracted the disease because pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooed.
In the world today, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease, it is worth contacting the family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30th is World Hepatitis Day, first organized worldwide in 2004 by disease associations.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford ran an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the rather bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out on 12 Catholic believers and atheists, while all were observing a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University take part in addition to academics.
The test was carried out exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the virgin Mary painted in the seventeenth century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci's hermeline painted in the fifteenth century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to have a calming effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time frame received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care" of them and "they were calm and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious-themed image they found 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but you have to find the right image.
“We have to look for an image that they have very positive feelings toward, like a mother or a father,” he said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it manages to change our personality,” Wright said.
After the excellent results, only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of such a caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the 10th birthday, Google can claim to be as much in people’s pockets as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they’ve spent their holidays, which clinic they attend, and what interests them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s directors, this is not enough.
What concerns the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google’s main purpose is to collect as much personal data of its users as possible and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of the founders of Google which was: “let’s put all the information in the world into a system!”
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years’ time, Schmidt replied: “Would you like to know how to answer questions like ‘what do I do tomorrow?’ or ‘what would be the right job for me?’, but the software doesn’t know how to answer seemingly simple questions because it doesn’t know enough about users.”
Not all Internet users are aware that during their Internet searches, exactly the words they are looking for are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
By means of the Personalized Search started two years ago, users can memorize their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked on, then in the long run they will generate much better tailored results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if my data is being used against me, if they look at what I do? - ask users concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, Internet users’ counter-reactions are provoked by the fear felt for the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not for the sense of guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire for freedom or even for the rebellion to power.
However, one fact is confirmed, namely that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of this in recent times has been the coordinated action against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internet users worried about personal rights instead sighed for relief in May when the company - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even after that you can not force Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government has successfully ripped out nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to get individual user search lists and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data scourge Google because they believe that this will affect their intimate sphere and privacy by starting to use its services and rise with the rebellion due to the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users who have appeared in numerous countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is kept always up to date and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies one of the keywords most often repeated in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can link them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that list their musical tastes, all of these can be inserted into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which their latest photo galleries automatically appear stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common tour of friends, comes easily to know with whom she spent the night her perfidious boyfriend or a company can fire his employee because he wrote a sincere opinion on the corporate summit: one thing is sure, the concept of privacy has now completely reconsidered.
Those who live a life online make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid the monopoly of Google can do it (starting for example with Scroogle using the Google search system but at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are not a few people who do not purposely register to community pages to not be found, the online applications of Google, from word processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not related to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far.
The public is not even waiting in secret for the moment when Google will pull out its claws.
Currently the company with its $156 billion in value is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords / AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, services introduced in record time instead cause major hardships not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development companies.
However, the critical observers next to all this find alarming points: the company summit, for example, completely rejected the protest of the employees after having doubled the right of the company kindergarten, considered too expensive the repeated daily catering interests of the employees, all this however diminishes in the face of the fact that in 2006 Google has bowed the head to the Chinese government and under their agreement all the results will be filtered.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is however certain, that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years will move the world at a point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines of Google will take on such proportions that the company will soon find itself in front of this American Supreme Court Health, others we can refer to
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled tale of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped <0xC3><0x93>zd’s double murderer disappear
Police have questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, who are well-foundedly suspected of helping to remove traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod region police station said on Tuesday.
The young people have admitted the crime charged to them, they are currently accused of favoring.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves freely.
Facilitation is punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated manslaughter for profit.
The investigation found that the 23-year-old owed a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, which is why on Wednesday he tricked his creditor into a construction site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a sign is the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
Police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech kroner, for the purchase of 100% of the stock price of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of its shares within a few months.
The Czech financial daily E15 says that the supply of Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have tendered so far.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all those interested the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Bank <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second September 11".
The global financial disaster happened thanks to the American president - accuses La Repubblica - who was not able to compact his party behind a law drunken in a hurry, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire superfinancier Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 9/11.
A section of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has put the world economy on the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing more and more and the whole world will suffer from it later.
Bush’s plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the biggest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat - mentions the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a lifeline to rocking financial institutions and with taxpayers’ money they can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as if in a domino effect, then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the member states of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control over the dismembered financial markets.
Only on Monday weakened financial institutions have obtained more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which the anxieties that even European taxpayers, similar to those of the United States, will have to put their hand to their portfolio to remedy the crisis seem increasingly real.
The EU has so far not cared much about the crisis that has traversed the old continent like a tsunami.
The "saviors" do not have to wave the 100 billion euros immediately, however it would be better if they established in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
Intelligent machine mimics the flight of the hornet
What could be the best method to develop anti-collision technologies other than mimicking the sensors of obstacles found in nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the hornets gave Nissan engineers the initial strategic inspiration on how to build the next generation of collision-proofing systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimicry robot BR23C, a robotic minicar with the properties of bees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system capable of avoiding all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really looks a lot like our protective shield - explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technologies and research and development at the exhibition.
Important is the role of the bee's view, capable of a 300-degree view in each direction.
The engineers drew on the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee's view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the necessary size to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, in a different way from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If this were not the case, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees the deviation can not go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to avoid other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lighter, high energy density lithium polymer batteries, which means their lifespan is longer than those of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneousness of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of the data or even less the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some inputs in a matter of seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvre data, so it only uses a memory of a few tens of KB.
There is no need for gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, they predict at Nissan, within 10 years can be installed on standard vehicles.
Further possibilities of application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding the obstacles present on the road leads to the destination.
They also found the name of the very expensive child.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue law was drafted for the purchase of the disproportionate credits, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the amount is spent.
In new deals stretching until midnight on Saturday according to East Coast time, congressional leaders have decided on the $700 billion bailout plan after a days-long debate, Reuters reported.
“We have made serious progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise plan.
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson, speaking of the outcome of the compromise, said: the programme will work and it will be effective, but there is still a lot to be done.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8:00 a.m. Washington time (at 2:00 p.m. Monday night Central European time), but it did not bring a large growth in stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the bill called the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 regarding the program, after which it will be up to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the news of the deal to the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight and greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that the $700 billion would all be spent on buying the bonds with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step you can spend at most half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of Congress, with these the Treasury Ministry will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the program in which the president of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The spending of the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can buy at the same time credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits.
The purchase can take place through auctions and in a direct way - announced competent of the ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for interested companies to take part in an insurance program where the Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which the companies will pay a price appropriate to the probable damages.
Henrz Paulson said: The law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to come in for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it be the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to make ourselves ready to introduce the law just signed," he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their success, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
Limitations on payments will only occur in some cases, furthermore the limitations depend on how the Treasury will offer help.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, if they do not retire the fallen bank director.
When the government buys disproportionate credits, it will intervene aggressively to ensure that directors’ money is not exaggerated.
To this it should be added that the already existing contracts of the golden parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to incentivize participation in the program.
This is the first case in U.S. history of a legal limitation on the remuneration of directors-general, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn if the economy, and along with it the bank saved, will recover.
The bill includes that in the next five years the president must present to Congress a proposal that provides for how to return the expected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa.
His fellow Ohio Democrat Mary Kaptur believes the measures were taken by the same people who are responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industry prices continue to rise
Prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - reports the Hungarian Central Institute of Statistics.
The export sales prices of the industry in July 2008 were higher than 1.1%, compared to the previous year, instead decreased by 3.9%
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than a year ago.
The prices of domestic industrial sales compared to the previous month increased only by 0.1%.
The domestic sales prices of the manufacturing sector also rose to a minimal extent, 0.1%, compared to July.
The biggest increase in prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoe processing sector (2.8%), especially bags and belts by 4.6% and shoe production by 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemicals and products sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimal extent in wood processing (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In the other sectors of the processing industry there was a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the supply of electricity, gas, steam and water, prices rose in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the authorities' dominant effect of the increase in gas prices since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, considering domestic sales of the processing industry sectors, the largest increases were in the petroleum product processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacturing of products derived from metalworking, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in the production of foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco representing a decisive weight.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.3%).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price increase varied from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total in the manufacturing industry over the past year prices rose by 10.2%.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector exceeded those of last year by 18.7%.
In domestic sales among target groups of sectors, the largest monthly price increase occurred in August in sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors that produce consumer items prices increased by 0.3%, in the energy and subsequent use sector prices did not change compared to those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the largest price increase was observed in the energy sector and subsequent use (16.8%).
In the sectors that produce consumer items the increase was 6.8%, for investment goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
The prices of industrial export sales calculated in florins increased in August by 1.1% compared to the previous month, compared in 12 months decreased by 3.9%.
The Hungarian guilder weakened within a month against the euro by 1.7%, against the dollar by 7.1%, compared to August 2007 by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement can enter into force - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago with Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion "now everything depends on the fact that overseas is built in time the electronic system of entry and control".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be an entry permit, however before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will hand over the medal of the Cross of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and engage in talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain have also backed the bailout plan.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for president of the two major American parties, on Sunday guaranteed their support for the government’s $700 billion plan to rescue the banks, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Treasury minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days on Sunday night announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on the bailout plan for the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market release financial package have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more fit than their rivals to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the focus on economic issues, Obama has regained a bit of an advantage once again, while McCain’s advantage, gained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin as vice president, has dispersed.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He underlined that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps which were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly ... the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn’t let himself be dismissed as outdated by McCain’s economic ideas.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that “all of us who are going to have a hard time putting this situation down ... but doing nothing is not a viable path.”
The Republican senator reported that the proposal includes the creation of a committee of control of the minister of finance and the limitation of the good exits of top managers, things on which he was the one who insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a role in the deal, but was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi on Sunday reported that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-aware - so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider’s party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-socialists have been modernizing Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The epoch change is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so is Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been achievable: the undisputed hegemony of a party-state is over.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had plummeted to 47.7%, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50% threshold.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005 again in the period of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization carried out in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists have predicted this 40 years ago, but they have made a big mistake in time. However, secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences for voters' loyalty to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities and the political consequences are obvious.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the CSU has been distancing itself from the classical bourgeois groups: the self-employed, the artisans, the graduates and the graduates.
Support for CSU fell below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily "Who with whom?" In the article "Party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with Austria's confused internal political situation created following the elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> intends to deal with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the intervention of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss a coalition.
The elections have been made, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast on public television the leaders of the parties have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of SP<0xC3><0x96>, has confirmed that he wants to negotiate with <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible, in some regions and the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor.
As he stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any event rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in <0xC3><0x96>VP’s internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still an open matter in the party, the issues should be discussed in any case within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Jörg Haider, leader of BZ<0xC3><0x96>, repeated that he was open in all directions.
“To prevent the Red-Black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for governing,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun, organized this year by France with the rotating presidency of the European Union.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, Fidesz MEP of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenum as the main rapporteur of the congress drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and also the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz EP, recalled, in addition to discrimination in hiring, that Roma are being excluded from the labour market in the first place because of their low schooling.
"The majority of young Roma do not have a middle-level degree and as a result of poor quality elementary education only a very small number of them can achieve a higher degree."
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in enforcing human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of EU member states.
In her view, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the wider context between Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma starts school, the greater their chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market; through taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the national budget.
"The right of European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - underlined L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the MEP, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the desegregation processes of schools and for this reason it is of fundamental importance to respect the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be stopped, the Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens to the future of Europe" - asked the J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year since the Berlin meeting last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of Huber-Beckstein will be decided.
Although the bad electoral defeat has not yet fallen heads, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the discussion of personal issues has been postponed for the moment.
Party president Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in their seats, the question is how long the pity lasts.
The fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes will decide the extraordinary congress of the party on the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have made it known in any case that they are not attacked with all their strength to the chair.
They so tried to soften angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union achieved 60.7%, now instead after the coup against Stoiber dropped to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of Germany's GDP.
However, there are still conservatives in the southern region who are of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, but in the future they will be forced to form coalitions.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the small exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Electors exposing right-wing values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup opportunity by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treated without regard to the woman of great ambitions.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber, who until now was plotting in the shadows, will also get an active role. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU called 28 September the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some statements to the CSU, according to which they deserved more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is re-established with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment over the fiasco, the CSU’s loss of ground will not negatively impact on Berlin’s grand coalition.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, the crisis of the social democrats on the other hand still lasts.
The SPD reached its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria at 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not a single opposition representative entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's election.
According to Russian observers it is the sign of well-being and stability assured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it is explained by the frauds committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people of a country of 10 million inhabitants has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (SDGs) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential term renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections held in some "sece" circumstances.
The SDG has thus renounced a boycott previously assessed.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians gas pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz crossing the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians considered anti-Russian can not enter for the political situation bielor.
It referred to a relaxation that the OSCE's assessment of the election campaign focused on positive movements rather than shortcomings, such as a ban on one-third of opposition candidates.
But the OSCE's quick report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not practically appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition, there is a noticeable improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even if Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on the paper, considers the two countries independent already for a month.
We have made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - Aleksandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the presidential candidate of the opposition in the 2006 elections, it is hoped that it will remain despite the fact that "the power was afraid to let even one opponent enter a Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not plan to protest for the results but rather tries to get the message of the need for economic reforms to the voters.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print the newspapers of the opposition in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that not even the officially most helped class, that of pensioners, considers appropriate the Lukashenko regime which considers the creation of social security as its main result.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security "reminiscent of sepulchral silence" - Milinkevich believes.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers considered the elections to be democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from now on this new measure starts against the smart ones, against those who stamp and then go to have a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services," says the minister.
“Now a new season of accountability and transparency is opening up.
This is reformism," Brunetta said.
Palazzo Chigi completes the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, the secretary general assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta’s words suggest, smiling, “a beautiful cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a conference at the School of Public Administration
In three months, absences due to illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60,000 more people at work in a year.
He added that it is necessary to make public administration more efficient.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants have joined together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree, adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Functions today flags numbers about the lower absence from work due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'operated faunillons' is constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands of correct and productive public administration employees in Italy who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree.
In particular, at the Tar will be contested the exclusion of additional economic treatments for illness dependent on cause of service; the extension of the time slots of availability of the sick worker, within which check-ups are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths were around 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the president of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association for the Mutilated and Invalid of Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "strong appreciation for the constant associative commitment in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
“There has been, of course, an indignant ‘enough’, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality proposes us again dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to linger in the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "that the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to put an urgent end to it".
"The data on occupational injuries seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but that does not take away from the fact that the number of white deaths is still impressive," said the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
“We would not want this ‘downward trend’ to result in less attention, because it is precisely when attention is relaxed that tragedy explodes.
“We believe that at a general level too little is still being done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion, more controls and inspections are necessary, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school".
"We need a further effort - he added - with regard to communication and public awareness.
But above all, there needs to be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation protection provided for victims of work" and the "assistance drift towards which the system is pushing in recent years".
"The objective is therefore to give back to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - so that the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on spontaneities or grants from time to time ordered by the legislator".
Mp3 players on trial put hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is according to the European Commission, which in a statement released in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
“From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day while holding the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high noise levels may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” says Kuneva.
“From the scientific findings, a clear risk emerges and we need to react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public.
We must also review the existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the widespread use of portable music equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from it.
Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and related equipment.
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
You can greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment who listen to music at high volumes (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limits on the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno launches the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which was set up this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will finalise the guidelines for Rome.
Once closed in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bulletin" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - he wants to emphasize Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for an idea of development of Rome that the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the City Council, can then use.
There is no overlapping of roles but only the will to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise timeframe.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is crushed on the management of daily life and on the emergencies that happen from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and farther, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences expressed by the Capital".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, neither closed nor immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a spirit of unity to its future".
A future that, clarifies the mayor of Rome "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
A well-known American politician who wants us to pass as independent wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote in a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big tough face: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that has had in all two governors and five black senators!”
In reality they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly attacks of a racial nature and do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? Then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Again, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the booth to vote we know well who the American patriot will give his vote.
It comes out one side of the American mentality kept covered up to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll figure out where to put the cross, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, which almost certainly appears the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89% answered: Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicking in the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Yet Iraq for the majority was Bush’s weak spot.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to do.
In the US, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, the "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control regarding the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put together the newspapers, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the general public understands it to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapers and senior executives are convinced that the national newspaper is following a wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishing houses open a door to the internet, for many seen as the "murderer" of printed paper.
The “economic pressure” journalists are warning of has increased by as much as 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will “do something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between those who run newsrooms — that is, the editors — and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “job security”.
Executives who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% nationwide.
For staff reporters it goes to 30%.
"Safe work" at the staff level (our editors) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under a contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it”, take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to reach a total of 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, get “sick” often during the year.
It's all about the climate.
UNIPOL: COURT ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYING IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate developer Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city ', Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation counter pact investigation.
During the trial at his expense, last week, he obtained the release from the domiciliary turned into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel the route from the provincial town to a house in the capital.
According to the court, however, these moves (to which the PM gave an opinion against) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the House vote against the $700 billion bailout launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times yesterday confirmed that the current crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those in Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the central and southern states.
The soul, for that matter, which has become powerfully alive with the vow of which I said at the beginning.
This is, however, only one example of the changes, of the great changes, which the current economic earthquake may foretell or already reveal: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
In both the US and Europe, the crisis seems to act as an accelerator for long-incubating phenomena that solidify in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category State-sovereignty in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that have, yes, deep ties with abroad, but that, first of all, see the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, involved to a very large extent.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: namely how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be out of the question or not to have much to say: the obvious proof is given by the European Union which as usual divides between the different interests and between the different state strategies fails to decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each individual state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all, the disbursement of funds: since when you get to the straits it is only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things in order.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, under certain circumstances, of which no market and no international organization will likely ever be able to dispose to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that more recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the net, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will have to reckon with the very immaterial things that are water, the harvests, the oil.
All things that, look a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are still absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So he who finds himself to be sovereign, certainly possesses several more cards than he who is not, to those who have the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, however, which foreshadows a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective needs authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, economic species, revealed to be so inadequate and full of shadows.
And together something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: a discredit, an insufficiency, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
That is to say, it seems to be coming more and more, in vast sectors of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the hitherto booming social elites, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the general sense of the term, to have made their own time and to be more and more foreign to the opinions of the majorities.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branching but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and the traditional political structures, which is manifested in the sudden "revolts" of the elections or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of these last and last times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the consensualists.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats, would say, are finding it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not now taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and which the economic crisis is invigorating, growing, potentially agitating.
In the face of all this, to speak of a "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not at all.
The superglue for walking on walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutions has come very close to it.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters the scholars managed to glue a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the gecko’s legs, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "detaches easily from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
“This material could be useful as a transient adhesive,” adds Dai Liming.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also devoting itself to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented an adhesive made up of microfibers like hair that self-clean from dust while moving on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time with some life-saving drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness depending on the case with even serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with taking certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice benefits to reduce the absorption of certain drugs, while canceling the life of some drugs.
Grapefruit juice was already under accusation because it was responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs to levels considered toxic.
The same Italian Agency of the drug had reported in an information bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY POMPEL - According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: “These findings are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually change the drug information notes.
So always read the leaflets of the medicines you are taking and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not make us impress but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification," the expert stressed to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies of business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 bombings, in the days when Enron was failing, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked not a few controversies and that for years was blamed on the economist, but that now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “great economist”, but also a “very aggressive” whistleblower, particularly critical of the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the more well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by voluntary developers, behind whose back SUN Microsystem guards, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and to the revised interface and made less spartan, more substantial ones are added such as the native compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and the support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) standard 1.2.
Attention is also paid to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some interesting features specific to some forms such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the ability to import PDF files in the graphic processing module, while retaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which match the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the word processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognisability during revision.
Some companies are also working to bring some features of OpenOffice to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and was added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation CD can also be shipped home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of gratuitousness can be a drag for the diffusion in homes, it is precisely in the business field that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there are also companies that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding videowriting of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the emulate presentations of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the jersey of best climber.
The news is on the website of the newspaper L’Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Analyses of Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity to Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will face the two years of canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka dot jersey for best climber.
NEW YORK TIMES: IS ITALIA RAZISTAN?
Italy "from a country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" reluctantly welcomed.
This is what is asked in a long article by the New York Times, which dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
In confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend underlined by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Student victims of expensive-rents up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for college students knows no crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants’ union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characteristics to the point that it excludes entire groups of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the high demand from students has so distorted the market that it has triggered a process of generalized increase also for residents".
In the majority of cases, the rental offers then contain a series of violations: free, unregistered contracts, no limit on fees, sub-rents linked.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room it goes from a minimum of 650 (Black Bands area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed you need 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city's economy.
Finally, in cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is an additional anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% in the fee applied to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historical halls
Historical cinemas close in favor of Multiplexes.
“A city without movie theaters is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the great multisales and the consequent death by consumption of monosales in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem inescapable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and full of memory, "it is as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom we have shared a piece of the street and many emotions, "says the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall perhaps and the nostalgia for a way of life.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, speak for themselves: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the biggest expense is the cinemas in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna stands out with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to show that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, “it is useful that new structures are built, but we should guarantee the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund in favor of traders: the previous debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year".
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, decided to run for shelter with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-room cinemas both in the historic center and on the outskirts.
Among the rules foreseen are tax facilitation measures for operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
“It is an initiative that I like,” Giuseppe Tornatore observes, “and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna’s example by putting in place other measures.
It is certain, however, that to counter the overpowering of multiplexes traditional halls must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New cinema Paradise", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the billboards blackened by the dust I turn to the other side.
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to harmonize the choices of the Municipality with the interests of the Piromalli thigh."
The accusations that the magistrates of the anti-mafia Directorate of Calabria are heavy to the mayor and the deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in mafia association.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, namesake of the boss, already convicted for association for criminals of mafia mold, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
"In defiance of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed willingness to pay advice to the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been granted to the thigh - write the judges - to officially enter the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already huge, of control and direction of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusion between local authorities and organized crime" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the ‘Ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean.”
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the thigh Piromalli.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a center-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He screamed at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having designed everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli shell had even come to ask for the variation of the project of the A3.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the PM, emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Pyromalli, harmonizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cage".
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones now come into the field.
It is an exterminated field, occupying more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources they have their eyes on, and now they are trying to get their hands on, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmental demands and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore swell facilities.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Colossi in the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in Northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later to bet on marine energy are more and more and among these companies always devoted to traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesman for a company affiliated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a not a small sign, especially considering that the US continues to extract oil in Alaska and recently President Bush has initiated a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power are on the path of energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested so far, though not known in detail, indicate, according to observers, a rising interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small in size and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, we must use technologies with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which causes the buoys to move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure causes a turbine to run, which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent ashore through submarine cables.
For now there are four such plants under design, pending only federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power is already producing power for a shopping mall and parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water when there are tides rotates turbine blades, creating a rotating motion that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electricity Research, deserves the potential of tides right now.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It is precisely on tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others overlooking the coast, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and planned investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
