European inflation slipped into food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the dizzying rise in food prices.
The price increase in the month of November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro zone, registering - after 2.6 percent of the month of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Bureau of Statistics of the Union based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent likely, Bloomberg reported.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut core interest on the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and reduced forced unemployment, would trigger a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "we have to negotiate" on inflation so that later it does not have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, registered in Germany, broke the record of twelve years; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation soared in the euro area as a result of galloping food and energy prices.
Wheat futures rose by 88 percent and soybean prices reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid for vegetable oil and dairy products in 2007.
The price of crude oil in the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching almost $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while for 2009 it will already fall to 1.9 percent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months at around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to double interest rates in 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stalemate, by early December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while the Gallup never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the party’s safe voters – due to the greater steadfastness of the opposition voters – would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) versus support of one-fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the limit necessary to have some parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who judged the economic situation of the country especially bad, while another 46 percent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
With regard to the coming year, the majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate and only one tenth expects an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the President of the Government performs rather poorly than well his functions.
13 percent of those surveyed trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny very much, while Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n has the support of 38 percent of those surveyed.
54 percent of the population do not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to control the discontent experienced in front of the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year, 35 percent felt it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, this ratio is currently only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believes that the only solution is holding new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation answered that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said that it is likely to participate.
By comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" would participate safely only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believe likely participation. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study fees, 79 percent of the medical consultation service and 84 percent of the hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of study fees, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average price level increase of 16 percent was maintained by the hypermarkets of Budaörs’ gold trading triangle, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g
This year also saw an average increase of 16 percent in Budaörs’ gold trading triangle from the Napi newspaper’s usual Christmas basket, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth than 1,000 HUF.
As prices in food supermarkets had already "fired" in December last year, so there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the nine thousand HUF, today they can not do it even for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with a redeemable two-liter bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's basket it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent the prices listed in Napi’s basket.
Comparing the values of last year’s most expensive basket with that of this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that during Christmas last year prices were felt the increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that shattered commerce, supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of circulation of a product, he may lose a significant profit on the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, as the highest price has now been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets the price of consumer essentials grew more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some staple foods, recorded in the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30 percent.
So, for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, there was, in the worst case, only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all the indices, the suppliers of flour have a stronger position than those of egg, being able to impose the drastic increase of prices even to the multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking by pallets the preserved food.
On Wednesday morning, the three stores formed large queues in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country the sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals you save with disinfectants
This year there have been several thousand infections in hospitals caused primarily by the misuse of antibiotics.
The hygienic circumstances prevailing in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overload of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the doctor-head of department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals you save even with disinfectants.
A MRSA infection has not long ago been diagnosed in the traumatology department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital earlier this year.
A person injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient shortly after had to return to the hospital as a result of the MRSA infection and since then it has not been possible to perform a major surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System," said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents has certainly been recorded, for the rest there is no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
A third of humans carry the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their nose without causing any disease.
Infections caused by AS (e.g., inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once over- or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, turn into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and spread rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or sepsis, in the first place to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with weakened body, to the elderly or to people of low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are common in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
“These patients are isolated, nurses take care of them in rubber gloves and masks, and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined for the presence of MRSA in their body, but infection cannot even be prevented in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor for the prevention of formation and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the diseases that carry MRSA in their bodies.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not fashionable.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to the public when already visible MRSA infections occur in the patient - said the doctor-head of the department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes stringent recommendations for the application of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of walking patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
It saves with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is spread from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, however also in this regard considerable faults are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted through drop transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favorable economic situation you save with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where the appropriate preventive measures are followed, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the contagion of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is being fought against in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The program appears to be successful, according to the data provided, infections with MRSA show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and that of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of District XXII has been made.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a stunned state can be excluded the then-resigned commander of the police of the XXII district, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passerby - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Attorney General of the capital, after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcoholemia that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before getting behind the wheel.
The then head of the police station of District XXII, Tuesday with his private vehicle when bending to Kossuth Lajos Street of District XXII ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated area for pedestrians.
(The latter fact, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The passer-by lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police officer resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was deeply moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is in charge of the Budapest Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
€400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and the Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed on Friday in Budapest three credit-limit agreements for a total value of 400 million euros to finance education, transport and environment infrastructures, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement worth 100 million, the contract just signed refers to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The €150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective in Hungary, the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later, by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the issue of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will revert to the issue of whether or not to modify the original contract and how to do it.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is in line with the EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that previously little-mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the even cheaper EU market, which will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is without a doubt Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on the ski slopes and chalets on the beaches.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while in Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
In the same way, the capital Sofia can be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a quick recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, and can thus be a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria, also strive to change their life and their way of life.
The majority of customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Also present are the Maltese and Cypriot promoters and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the beaches of the Black Sea and in the ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, in addition to the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important for them.
The second category consists of buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group are real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of profiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate considerably outweighs the growth in wages.
Fodor and the Six by Hundreds of Hungarians
As reported by the Minister of Environment and Hydrology G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor the meetings at the level of experts will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and policymakers from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap for post-emissions efforts under the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the subject between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to agree that compared to the situation in 1990, by 2020 the emission of greenhouse gases responsible for the greenhouse effect will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
Agreement was also reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, foreseen in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member steering council, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
The Six Hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Hydrology G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing by 2020, from the 1990 level, its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent, regardless of whether or not the “post-2012 agreement” will be signed, and is willing to commit to reducing even by 30 percent if the world’s other major developed regions and developing countries are also willing to take commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor pointed out that the countries signatories to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol pledged to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states pledged to meet an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary’s commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent over the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply with.
There is a lot at stake in Bali, since within two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emission reductions, the need for which was noted in its most recent report by the International Peace Conference.
With this, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2 <0xC2><0xB0> C in the average temperature of the Earth could not be prevented, a fact that according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish footage of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
It was first the British Air Force (RAD) that took advantage of YouTube’s services: special units deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar’s general operations corps, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been uploaded to the Internet in this way and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of actions perpetrated in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to introduce the public to the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This type of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional recruiting TV spots - defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'<0xC3><0xAA>tre of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made a video game.
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, there are also amateur videos in the distributor, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have been uploaded to the Internet and numerous videos recorded in real operations, but the British military is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form of recruitment with free downloadable shooting video games called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salted cake at the Christmas party of ministries
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how power is fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The largest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
The children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts at Christmas for the Orphans, and the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited for Christmas for the Missionaries, as well as a reception for the press.
This portfolio will allocate $25 million for the holiday atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The festival of the MET will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred workers of the ministry is expected the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty.
In the party of the portfolio will reign a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be tombola draw.
The ANF Christmas cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a contest management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of Lucia Day on December 7.
Their CNAJ did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s greetings and after dinner there was live dance music.
Answering [Origin]’s question, they reported: To attend the dance it was not obligatory to wear a suit or dress at night.
Health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
Instead, Labour Minister Monika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a year-end working meeting.
It has the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will drink only coffee and salty cake, so the party will not cost more than 350,000 HUF.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai will instead simply toast with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the reception will be paid with buffet and a toast.
Since J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres is the minister, the MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the time of the afternoon of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year reception on January 20, at the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, to which only the specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas parties - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environment portfolio they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party that will be held in the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will on Friday constitute a strike commission to coordinate Monday’s strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - work stoppage will begin.
Certainly this action will cause great difficulties in transport, since the railway transit will be stopped completely and until 13 hours the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday, which they will hold jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists will also be set up to coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will strike indefinitely if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call to strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the National Assembly’s Monday agenda, it is also possible to vote only on the public health law in the very late hours of the night, or perhaps near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: in the railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning it may stop part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the intercity transport of buses of the companies Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for a definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 pm workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, the Budapest Airports from 7 am to 9 am, will hold a four-hour strike the LIGA unions of the electrical industry and thermal energy, the unions of the Educators called a strike of 2 and the union of Democtic 2.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will strike nationally at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) which is part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and subject a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will come into effect next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, that advanced pensions allow the occupations that deserve them to enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the lateral railway lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from various points of view.
In the company's "risk warning" it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes can occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this character - added the representative of the research institute.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life ceded the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between Roma and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflict - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of stability and democratic development of the country".
We are reminded that: from the autumn of 2006 onwards, the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups in Hungary received increasing publicity and momentum and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been formed in the country that call themselves "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is to say the State," they add.
They affirmed that all this is done in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
For highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
In recent months, in many neighboring states the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures in certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard functions in a similar way to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass riots of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the guard, on the grounds that the objective of the organization is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "Gypsies terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - Political Capital recalls.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard so far has shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Roma in Hungary also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, director of research at Political Capital, told the news agency: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that may influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - which next year will be less - workdays are reorganized.
Even in the EU or in North America, the holidays are not unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, state holiday and public holidays.
The festive days are fundamentally related to religious festivals and historical ephemeris.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven festivities written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on October 23, commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the State, on May 1st the feast of labor, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day feasts: Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, which is why it is often bridged when before or after the holiday there is only one working day.
In exchange for the extended weekends as well, during the previous Saturdays you can not be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly before or after the feast.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and civil servants.
It is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work uninterrupted even during the holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 practically stops life in the country, since according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our parties will coincide with mid-week or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working hours than this year.
First, the agenda around the Labor Day will be modified so that then, for four successive days, workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be working day, so that in return Friday May 2 will be a festive day.
The other change relates to the holiday of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, work will have to be done instead of Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, the coming year during the holiday of the end of the year can be rested, since from December 24 will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six small deterrents to bitteren the lives of your colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that pass us unnoticed: all of them are part of our everyday "Folklore" at work.
Decide whether to adapt to minor discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
Sorry, I forgot to let you know you've been picked up from the marketing department," one of your colleagues said.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to fix the issue, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to give you the message (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the issue is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to embarrassing explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can bitteren the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Have you borrowed something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, an office tool, or your phone and you can’t find them.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Do not take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry at you for stealing their things.
Do not pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and run out ahead of time.
Gossip about your colleagues’ private lives?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about your colleagues’ particular lives!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when they share their most intimate secrets with you!
Buried in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know the things about him.
Are you taking sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office on the phone and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or well, you feel that you prefer to rest on that day; think of others who must do your work, your impervious tasks, your work on term.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you should stay at home, tell them so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to face your absence the next day.
Gossip, laughter, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but are you suddenly getting rid of the laughs of your colleagues?
Have you unintentionally heard a phone conversation that would have been better off not listening to it?
Do not bother your colleagues with your hums, chants, conversations aloud (less when you do them over their head), kicks, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontents aloud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not currently delving into a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something on time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
Don’t allude to the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that hurts others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and sneakers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Do not wear a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be messy, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning jam.
It sounds a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I turn up the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones is added the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national musical life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam looks totally different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new record.
Some new and interesting songs from the [b2]digital [b3]national underground are slowly changing the image and although garage rock style is fashionable again, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has proven: there are novelties under the Sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The larger audience knew the ensemble that initially acted only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national formator of trends, capable of being sold also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and its ensemble are fashionable, but no one has asked them if they wear this label or not.
The whole reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
The reference to the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and the trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millennial György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the mr2 channel Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi that recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought to the ears of radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are playing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The definition of select audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has larger traditions.
There not only the fifteen and twenty-year-old generations frequent the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they come from, and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good to see that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We don’t write music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, trust the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, since many of us started our career in his group and from there we embarked on another path.
hvg.hu: In the list of hits of mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it at the end of the album, trying to relax after the album’s sound orgy and the heavier songs.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of good-voiced soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you write the song exactly that way or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material of the album, we thought that something is still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came practically on the first try and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas as well.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay’s brief solo), they have no role of their own, they sing all together and no louder than the music, so the music doesn’t just accompany their songs.
Also on stage they are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song is also about it, about forgetting for a while our ego, the one who came from where and where he is going, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted to get others to feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: To which did you dedicate more work?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather when it comes to mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want the groove to work and then, little by little, everything got into place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French bank giant of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Commercial Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, undoubtedly, with good abilities.
He long ago intuited, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s responses to what French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, reveal is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his businesses.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he says in his answers.
In the summer, he managed to win 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity already saw it coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income clients or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those clients would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not have affected the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, its profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, that he has left nothing for himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even fooled the bosses, even as the Eurex Stock Exchange became interested in his business.
The risk became a benefit.
Were you afraid it would be discovered?
Rather, no.
“I thought I had made $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would cheer you up.”
Where did he get so much willpower to take that risk?
In my position one had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $ 90,000.
Still, I knew I was never going to win as much as the others.
“In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress,” Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this meant a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll leave you
“This is like a snowball,” police said.
But it is said that the chiefs knew of all this or rather suspected it.
“While I was making money, they closed their eyes.”
Only then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all footprints.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did they get him?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a vacation is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his file,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to get 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion kronor will come out of seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kroner from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Business and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should secure funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the newly-entered countries that use them the least.
Twenty-year sentence for former president of Nicaragua, court ruled
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday decreed a 20-year sentence for the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, who was convicted in 2003 for the embezzlement of 100 billion dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest on his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002 will be back behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will be up to the prison officers if they let Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n finish his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n was constantly transferring money from the government to a company account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, in fact, to his closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n created to fund his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The state budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, passed the new law with tranquility.
It is a great paradox.
Every government begins and ends with every chapter and budget item, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and is therefore given special attention.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State Budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three shortcomings that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of the presidents that are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public financing, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the biggest risk is not in the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to be able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, fees and credits from banks, often issued, meaningless, bonds with which they disproportionately indebted to their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy stocks and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we follow only the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, is going through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, as <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put the state finances in order.
Instead, however, the state continued to indebted itself.
The rest of the countries, except for some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that it falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why massive social programs are not necessary, which, unfortunately, in recent years have been unnecessarily inflated with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if the retirement age and pension reform do not change soon then it will be the end of really any policy in this country and, whoever governs it will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians who govern will be transformed into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending on the presidents.
The planned deficit of more than $70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not squandered what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become only officials so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and fees, the peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
More than a hundred billion dollars will be received through tenders in the Monetary Marking.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will bid for forty billion dollars, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report for clients.
“This coordinated action by central banks likely reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks must really be afraid of what awaits them when they decide to take this step,” said ABN Amro’s chief economist Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems in accessing loans and that they will have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks so decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, London’s interbank rate that is used for lending money in the interbank market.
This means that the banks constantly feared borrowing money even as the US, Canadian and British central banks lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the housing market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecologists' Debates are Incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
Criticism arose now with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric being used and reality.
“There the debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president stressed during the presentation of his book that this topic is very important to him and that that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "I often find myself only with the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now find out about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
Moreover, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the date and therefore did not manage to change their old driver’s license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials will give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be found on the roads without a valid license.
According to traffic, the card has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of cards, the offices of the metropolis are full of applications and interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates about 2,000 customers daily.
In the queues you wait for half an hour.
Around 140,000 drivers have not yet been issued in Prague.
The issuance of a new card lasts 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card in a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their driving license and do not reach until the end of the year, but will go on the roads without the valid license will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the offense with a warning.
In the event of an administrative violation, the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a fine could be imposed on a person who does not go anywhere.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to introduce moderate fines of a thousand crowns, at most.
According to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, fines of 1,000 kroner do not threaten anyone.
According to him, a driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don’t want to drive should give their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driving license.
People with the document from 1994 to 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between the years 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it is about 2.6 million more documents.
Court reduced sentence for Berdych's accomplice detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided as a final expiration the reduction of the sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the department against organized crime were going to fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years.
The decision of today can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case but the verdict of the Court of First Instance awaits him in the first place.
Despite this, he has already been sentenced in other trials to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement in the robbery of 19 people and the High Court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants’ allegations were rejected by the investigation as fabricated causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped criminal group members avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment refers to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
Regarding the theft, its victims suffered serious impacts on their health but are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without a permit for weapons.
In the home search, police found pistols, steel core ammunition, a laser driver and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this case, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to Berdych's case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases have not yet appeared.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await a final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change a few children: 12 million
For changing children in the maternity home, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, disagrees in principle with Veleba's proposal.
“We don’t approve of such a demand, it’s too high,” Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today’s meeting.
“In order for us to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the specialist’s report that the counterpart sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescission value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for everyone,” Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the parents.
At the beginning of the cause, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>'s family wanted, for each month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist ' s report, except that it was drawn up at the hospital of Motol ' s faculty in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stressful situation was best supported by the men although they fought with recriminations for the girls’ change.
Women are doing worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba said.
Veronica and Nicola were traded by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> Maternity House last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xBD> to P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
The governor of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, gave 100,000 crowns to each family at the end of October as compensation for the mistake made in the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and extraordinarily can ask for help from the administrator.
The court until today recognized them with a proportionally low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily of one million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the fight over the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with whom the actor collaborated.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not appear for oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasites of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's popularity," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone gets the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We’ve been working for about ten years.
Searching for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the trademark Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in his television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
At that time it was not a question of directing it towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From this comic origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> later created the company Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors to his farm and attend his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also ruled today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used a simple idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polivka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who dedicated themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, between the now decomposed parts, continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka the official coronation in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, the culmination of which came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the eternally chosen".
The leading role in the kingdom, through Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, resulted in the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, as queen mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed an indictment against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with his princesses, which is already preparing Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The new king should come out of him.
He did not want to reveal any more data or dates.
“We are in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can present himself," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its gear characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is in the market his successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I complained, for example, about the space of the headboard in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer in front of the two meters of length.
Flying around the world
I step inside quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value more the invention of design although already the car looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backs.
Also unlike the 206 model, the lateral steering has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi the aforementioned shortage of space in the headboard disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This should be valued as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear door) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not disturb, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot is lagging behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when placing the stroller of the child its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the floor that is quite flat after knocking down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 1600 should look like that would belittle the familiar five doors.
It is quiet, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it with the time of the <0xC5><0xA1>koda of that time, which seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a cloth, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, you can still.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 kroner, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbags in the headboards, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper blades, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but count on the team’s add-ons at the Fabia and you’ll come up with a pretty similar number.
Now it remains to be decided which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
In English schools children from Eastern European countries are attending and therefore locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record those cases where conflicts between emigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak emigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bullying among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was sticking a 10-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist-sounding insults.
Police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls gave him racist insults and threw stones at him.
“When we were going home, a boy came up to us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave, he gave us the urge to throw apples and pears at us, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his ass,” another nasty incident was described to The Times, the Slovak student’s mother.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with Eastern European emigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above, show us how the environment in English schools is starting to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 registered Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can come true, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and all enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island do you find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and brought to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the United States (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings emerged, wide avenues ran cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio the stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita Ab<0xC3><0xA1>nense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, cocktails are mixed according to your wishes.
And those cars already cult of the 50s, to this day continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived a long time ago have rusted amid these humid and salty winds.
Although Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the area as there were.
Other places are metamorphosed into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railroad lovers.
Sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to sugar factories by narrow ways in steam or electric machines.
Their garages for tens of years were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sister models that are in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway hacienda there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not miss it.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in limestone rock lands.
Mogotes, limestone pylons and rocks of high steep in the falls of the valley, and in its caves acclimatize fertile lands thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where probably the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the Havana cigar factories you can find your final product.
Perhaps someone finds it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
Trinidad
Old town that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later French settlers, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is such a remote place that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road that linked it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore, nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Ancon Beach or the Valley of Sugar Factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely this opinion is already confirmed by the path itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was and that there is now a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, the Santer<0xC3><0xAD>a, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, could be filled with many pages.
However, as they say, it is better to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few troops and insufficient equipment are what are influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defense Minister Robert Gates, should devise a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not performing as expected, agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland) representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to step up activity, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
“The development in Afghanistan is palpable, but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next step is to enable people to start economic and security development on their own," Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan rebel activity, according to U.S. military data, is higher than in the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
They are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
Among the countries attending in recent months, there is controversy over whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for being passive.
“The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun this week called the German soldiers vague.
“The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting,” Sun wrote in a piece of material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph where the British troops were playing a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State Debt Will Reach Billion by 2009
For every Czech the state owes 84,000 kroner.
Total debt in September amounted to 842.72 billion kroner.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kroner.
However, in early December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the improved evolution of the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic’s state debt grew at the end of September to 842.72 billion kroner.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, since June it has decreased 13.4 billion kroner.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt of early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state indebted itself with more than 111 million kroner.
“For now it seems that thanks to next year’s low deficit we could cross the trillion crown border until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion kroner," Patria Finance economist David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance economist Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora similarly sees it: “We could spend the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene were seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don’t see that change,” he added.
Doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The debt of the state is paid by means of treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic indebtedness grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
Foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z crowns since June was reduced by 13.7 billion z crowns.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total year-on-year debt from the first to third quarter created 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is generated primarily from bonds where there is growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the strategy of payments and debt management of the state for the year 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement in the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91,300 million crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion kroner for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroner to finance state obligations and 1.8 billion kroner in payments of European Investment Bank loans.
Today he was confronting Jarthum in court for naming a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting 6- to 7-year-old students name a teddy bear after Muhammad when any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was liable to a penalty of whipping.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code with attacks on Islam and sedition as a result of several complaints by parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 out of 23 children have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Muhammad is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the prophet's depiction regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, “I’m just sorry that I asked the children to vote for a name,” which he said was only an “innocent mistake.”
Opinion shared by numerous pupils of the school teacher who described her as " very attentive towards her pupils " and " who never speaks of religion in class " ..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child in a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Serbians and Kosovo Albanians ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of discussions without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
" We do not foresee violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period ", he added, noting that " obvious tensions exist ".
End of Mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday to Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on Dec. 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, insist on a continuation of the negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners consider independence under European Union supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," Kosovo Autonomous Authority President Fatmir Sejdiu announced at the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has expressed some of his regrets.
But he added that Belgrade’s autonomy plan “belonged to a past that has led to killings and deportations.”
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade particularly feared a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
“For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a right of veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had declared.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made " in consultation " with Westerners.
Bush starts Israeli-Palestinian deal
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he met Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common statement.
He noted that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old litigation point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides’ obligations with respect to the peace itinerary they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority presided over by Abbas would seek " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues " .
This denomination covers the three main perilous problems of the Israeli-Palestinian point of contention: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be “global and deepened” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
On his return to the podium, Olmert pledged to make the negotiations "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008."
At the end of 2008, Bush set an end to the implementation of his coexisting Palestinian and Israeli " two-state vision " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment in this regard on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks “a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” Prince Saud said in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As well as every time in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17:00, Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
“I was not in intervention but on patrol, and I was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a revolving headlight,” a police source explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not homologated, i.e. not authorized to drive on public roads " (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " at full throttle " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the give way to the right," the police said.
The alcohol control practiced on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (the bumper front, cracked windshield, bumper ripped off) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>re de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into " acts of involuntary manslaughter and refusal of aid " to the IGPN, co-ordinated with the departmental management of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor states that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stadium, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the policemen, namely that this minimotocycle arrived relatively quickly to their left " .
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by rubbing the shoes on the floor, showed that both vehicles had been stuck in time for the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police had left the site very quickly, thus not providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious misconduct " with regard to this point.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs further investigation, on which we must be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of its windows that precisely overlooks the scene.
"We immediately went downstairs with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to resuscitate them," the witness said.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw " a completely terrified policeman, who was limping.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen have been driven by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
According to this witness, relief arrived " about twenty minutes after the march of the policemen " .
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not provide assistance to the young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tensions Rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first demonstrations since the establishment of a state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting against emergency measures have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
The latter replicated with stone throws, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police loaded and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations were reported to have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement picked up the support of religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “urged the population to send flowers to the judges who ruled against the state of emergency and the waste to which they were sworn in before Musharraf.”
" Musharraf's Promise No Longer Fulfills "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly concerned with the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to rule in the coming days on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election to the presidential election on 6 October, by indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court,” he told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's pledge to leave the army and become a civilian president "does not value" after the establishment of a state of emergency, Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to drop his military uniform by November 15, the end date of his first presidential term.
The assistant minister of information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf was assigned to reside by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not expected, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better "dominance of fertility ", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours in space to make the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel indispensable for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "stuck" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts had released from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece in charge of soon hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for modules-laboratories.
We need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew’s second task was to move a 17.5-ton solar-paneled electricity-producing module already on the ISS to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the reorganization of the module’s solar panels that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that’s where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, has been damaged in a little more or less than a meter by a cable that got stuck.
Deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to make a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snailing at the end of the 30 meters in length of the shuttle's remote-controlled arm added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Tall, sturdy, very skillful, has a highly developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this doctor of training has been commissioned to "operate" the solar panel "wounded".
After having precisely inspected the damage, he severed the fallible cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second spacewalker who had stayed near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "stamped" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a noon rest before today, seven astronauts return from the shuttle Discovery for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS stock is currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group has announced that it will tend to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with A400M delays.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its forecast of the operating result for 2007 in response to the delays generated by the slow progress of the A400M engine development, which conditions the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income targets (EBITs) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any further ciphered accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operating result of EADS failed by 86 % in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to the delays of another programme, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians are going to opt massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses the voters today a televised message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as leader of the list for United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory proves overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything be transparent by welcoming foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with handing over a new charge against the West accused of meddling - his favorite subject during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want fairer, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident,” he said.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Zyouganov says there has never been "such dirty elections, until Yeltsin's time."
Following the crackdown on last weekend’s demonstrations, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, is banned from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the Soviet homo mentality"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open-ended questions:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in both legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel themselves masters of their destiny," estimates sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief,” estimates Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly given evidence after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New liberties imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: " Why reflect?
Those in power aren’t too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the destinies of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are openly accessible.
The 47 million file documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were hitherto not searchable only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his rightholders.
The eleven states in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to search “particularly about the displacements of prisoners, the camp population and the health status of forced labourers,” explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to the opening to the public of these nominative documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, eventually, to provide proof of their internment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin, said in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
In April, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission their approval to begin negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free-trade pact will greatly dope both economies" and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European commissioner José Manuelo. The Asian and European giants exchange each year for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services ", said this week New Minister Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade with the Prime Minister of India has not yet reached its potential.

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10bn in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about easing the current turnaround of concerns over credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion bid at the base rate of 5.55% in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
“To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation,” it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market so on December 6 at 12h 15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time it appears that the bank England BoE puts liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done within a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it " is prepared to take further steps to keep interbank lending rates " up to date in line with its core index.
The interbank index per day was 5.829 percent on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
The parties UMP and NC deny the examination of the proposals of the PS party on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the socialist purchasing power bill, which amounts to a dismissal of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, among which the increase of 50% of the bonus for employment, the re-establishment of the floating TIPP (internal rate for oil products), a check-transport or the restrictions of rents.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between the majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more and no less, the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place Aug. 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Republic Festival director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisation of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a marketplace and were working with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
“Unfortunately, we stagnate in low-profile policies because of the current administration,” Jones said.
“Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional venue that, lately, is taking place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago’s Grant Park, having made its way into the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours is more in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both a country festival impression in the European way and urban in the American way.”
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow investing in such an event and hosting a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s hotel offering is “very large,” like the 80,000-person Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been issued to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces off against Terminator
It’s not easy to lure Hollywood movie plates to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces runaway productions.
Is it difficult to compete with the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If you find that conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best,” he says.
The Race to Festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race for the Oskars has begun.
All West Coast festivals, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, value them and make sure that filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on show in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock exchange? The experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
With less than five weeks to go until the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasting should not be based solely on statistics, especially since in the current context uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock market taking a run in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight to quality values both in the long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the probable fall in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, head of sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
“There’s not a lot of joy,” says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from its November 8 highs when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, said that we are close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the U.S. in terms of the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst is confident that these are positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be responsible for taking the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana, from Intermoney, states that "this year is about great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some construction companies "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco says that the increases will come from the hand of the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, should it occur.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow the same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the holiday sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a bearish month on only two occasions.
The real year-end rally was in 2003, a year in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a rebound of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the moment Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close a deal with unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of the experience of Popular will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that supports the schedules of shops.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, self-employed and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling the existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile that customers present on the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, says that this restructuring does not imply a great investment, although a greater hiring of personnel, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a of Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very long schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises PopularMax will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones, with personnel external to the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've got it."
With that phrase yesterday expressed his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect clouded his joy: “It’s what hurts me, not because we’ve grown more, but because we’ve dropped less,” he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, “we have fallen less.”
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That profit puts its loss at what we’ve been doing this year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518,53 million Prisa (publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we monetize it in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television network this year to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this figure becomes real, the television network would record this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover compared to the 965.4 million of the fiscal year 2006.
Antena 3’s net revenue increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to 734.4 million) while net television revenue grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent company Mediaset.
“We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, who we have already valued with 33% of Endemol.”
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009 by 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the fact that the projected revenue growth has been cut from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3’s profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

The Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force November 1
Parallel to its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim that both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and consensualize the best regulations in order to guarantee the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
The MIFID, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new rules will allow the provision of financial advisory services to specialised firms as well as to natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current exchange managers.
The law also obliges investment firms to disclose information on the market about key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they perform, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In his visit to the Congressional Economic Commission, several modifications were incorporated, among which he emphasizes that the securitized debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened with the debt of high-risk U.S. mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can develop 30 years after the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was approved in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work for an employee, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting customers to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases by five tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The leading indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the forward indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the definitive data, which will be released on December 14.
"CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes has said that the 4.1% rise in the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he has predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that "even if the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same of the last years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged with respect to the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it amassed record deposits of over <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the distrust of its customers and despite the 100% guarantee of that money offered by the Government and which it will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity to its financial trading brand Virgin Money, needs to raise around a quarter of the revenue from British banks that are deposited over the next three years to raise that remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin consortium’s offer, in which three other companies are involved, as its favorite to rescue it from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Guardia Civil has arrested today in the early hours of the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo last May replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then councilor of the municipality, and according to research sources consulted by the Cadena SER, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The agents continue to register the municipal units and the Urbanismo department and no more arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As yesterday reported by Cadena SER, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore, was arrested leaving Morales's home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to research sources, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the candidacy of the PSOE for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if they win the elections.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to top the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This has been announced in a press conference by the secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that he has held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "it seems" that the politician Manchego will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as president of the Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting climate change in the university field.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he has pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he succeeds, Bono hopes to turn the House into “the house of respect and not of insult or shouting” and make it “more and more like the citizens”.
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk quietly and quietly is the Congress, the president of the government was interrupted on one occasion in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his good work" and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "prepotence".
Climatic propaganda
Since the anti-climate change movement mercilessly persecutes both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is bound to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach obliges him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in which sectors it has occurred and why his government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires him to explain with maximum clarity to the Spaniards what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we be obliged to make, what economic consequences will it have.
That is, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and will be no such explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the gasoline penny suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with slogans empty of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not intend that we travel by bike or cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana are arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the city secretary and a hospitality businessman for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose dependencies he is currently with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Department of Urbanism and the municipal company for the management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which is instructed by the Court No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have now been brought to court.
According to the sources, the former councilor of Totana and now MP of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been imputed, as well as the current girlfriend of the former councilor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of Grupo Nuaria, the lawyer and businessman from Vigo Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Soil of Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven registrations, most in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
Grupo Nuaria was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks of the streets of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico Square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way at the head of the PISA report on education in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the critique of Blackburn’s book:
“The content of the Philosophy signature has jumped to public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Counselor in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague shares information on the introduction into the Penal Code of offences against Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal in the store records worth less than 400 euros, it is considered simply lacking (article 623.1).
B. If you steal in the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than the one imposed on the download (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than that of unloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participation in a tumultuous quarrel is punishable by three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would be punishable by six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the authorization of the authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone is giving away their hand, a very long hand.

My GP drops me one of his articles on rare research titled, 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less.'
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study has been conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if both of them got the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received twice as much, the activation was higher.
I don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years since the prosecution of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre – in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died – former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on that list from which the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's List' (2006, not released in Spain) which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fleeing criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
Which insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in case of possible accidents, is a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which states that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the more likely you are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to pay.
It is for this reason that both those over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower accident rate due to their prudence.
Using counts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use that is given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it the probability of having some type of mishap.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will explain here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various inconveniences when it comes to taking out insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the driver’s license.
Although the ideal to be well insured is an all-risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an all-risk with franchise, so that they get insurance coverage at all-risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the client would pay a portion of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer contributes will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", specifies Luis Noguera, head in Spain of First Europe, online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer is assured protection against damage caused to third parties, although not to those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered for theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
One piece of advice.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of it.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
After the age of 25, drivers have it easier when it comes to contracting insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is most advisable to hire an all-risk franchise.
"Normally young people can not make use of the experience previously acquired when jumping in an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, to which he adds that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once passed already the 'fear of the newbie'.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation allows it, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by the insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at full risk with deductible (it could be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one extended to third parties from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They carry out a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to allow themselves to take on a greater amount of franchise,” says Luis Noguera.
For retirees, it is advisable to have an all-risk insurance with franchise (this being 150 euros), or an extended one to third parties when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in case of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
Celtic are looking for a point worth eight in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the league of the 'Champions', as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians have ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that Shakhtar, with six, and who receives Benfica, who has four, does not go ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played one week before the end of the entire sixth day, as Milan have to play in the Club World Cup in Japan, where they debut on the 13th in the semi-finals in search of a place for the final of the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie at Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing in eighths.
Gordon Strachan's team might even need a loss to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because at nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanites will try to make the night bitter to the Scots, who hope to get in eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were defeated in that round last season with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the ida.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the victory, in case he loses Celtic, both to get into eighth and to stay in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being last and with no options to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with a win, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before starting their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out tickets to attend the concert, which included a video telling the story of the band that raged in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects his main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls took to the stage wearing bracelets given to them by Posh Spice's husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd at GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had barred him days earlier.
In the run-up to the show, Victoria Beckham said the British star "hasn't seen our dressing room at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
“I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I’m glad I made the decision,” Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “things have been sorted out and we all love each other very much.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies awaited them.
Among the five are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of it affecting Russia’s export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every rubbing between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopolistic gas owner Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would charge Ukraine more, as Ukraine has pledged to pay an extra 50 percent in 2008 for gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
“Changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is still not fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Central Asian Soviet nations.
NHS “should test foreign workers”
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a vigilante said.
Auditor General Robert Black’s recommendation came after it was found that a foreign doctor was linked to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea how many foreign staff it has.
However, his report noted other checks that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor general checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European economic area in the wake of the Glasgow airport attacks.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep into the gates of the airport’s terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in the UK.
NHS expects to conduct pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses “Disclosure Scotland” to conduct criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Great Britain.
The auditor general’s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
“While we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: “Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS personnel.”
BMA Scotland President Dr. Peter Terry said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checkups could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment checks work at NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being complied with widely.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the pre-employment policy and guide for foreigners on the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I had great interest in this work being carried out in the wake of the Glasgow Airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups – including foreigners – that they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division Dominates at Film Awards
Control, the biopic about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Picture.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal."
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis's rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film, which features soundtracks from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was produced for just <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
But Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards – for best director and best debutant director.
Rock music was at the center of another award-winning ceremony – like Julien Temple’s film about Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, it won the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor award was given to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver for a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg’s film Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it’s really an honor.”
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa’s supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the facilities at Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government has warned religious leaders that they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining as al-Qaeda militants to fight allied forces and backing the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered a heretic by the more extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants — recruited by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to harass the country’s pro-Western government — targeted foreign government-associated residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a 16-person "media cell" in Medina, whose goal was to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus' climate may give an idea of Earth's future
Venus may once have been an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results from the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: “It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
“Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police seize ‘enriched uranium’
One kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
It still remains open
Mitt Romney says it's unworthy of presidential candidates to answer a snowman's questions.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and submit them for dissemination among the candidates.
None of the questions posed on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate change in the YouTube GOP debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party ahead of next year’s election.
It is not known exactly how the CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show the aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to raise the dial when they heard ideas they liked: broadcasters noticed spikes of approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest word exchanges of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a frontrunner in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing the illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the chance to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
Neither has the say in being a candidate nominee, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and broadly speaking, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fear of China’s toxic toys and other foreign concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became awkward when other issues came up.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now, against all odds, first in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is rising in Iowa, coinciding with Liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns, and his heated remarks from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the game is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Dolores Laborista
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but equally emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor sucked extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour ruling party, worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million), for nearly four years using false names, and that the party did not denounce him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister shied away from calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative emptiness.
A trio of retired generals began a mutiny in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: to be ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it’s David Abrahams’ multiple donations; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown walks irrevocably to the exit.
Governments can reach a tipping point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it’s clear that the prime minister can’t make things better, that he doesn’t have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press looks for bad news; and the government gets defensive and doesn’t focus.
On one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although he wanted to disown Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the treasury.
And even when it’s not directly involved in Blairish’s setbacks — or “partner cash,” political party funding research — voters can assume it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died or been scammed directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but he does not make the decision.
The anti-anonymity laws for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham’s deal, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these actions, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter — conducted, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as find a permanent and independent head for the Commission on Standards in Public Life, since he has not had one in six months, and he must also push for genuine reform of party funding.
This will require an arduous co-operative work of Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the trade unions – bitter measures for a partisan like Mr. Brown.
But he has to deal with some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is by acting with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks Cards
Is the Subprime Mortgage Crisis Infecting the American Credit Card Market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural for dorsal fins to swim excitedly around.
Now that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million charge in its U.S. consumer finance business, in part due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delinquency and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American Bankruptcy Law (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, delinquency) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports strong payout rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than active securities, so falling prices don’t necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ creditworthiness.
They can even work to outperform the issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue to amortize the mortgage decrease if the properties are worth less than the loan value; and as a result, the payment of the card debt rises on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders face by changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid asset tightening.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit contraction pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility in the frauds with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a celebrity case in Britain over the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the 2001 collapse of Enron.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were that they alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron’s downfall.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a myriad of scams at Enron, which helped its spiral fall into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three British knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the subsidiary’s bank interest at $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest on the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers raised $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted on two counts of conspiracy in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay the $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting stunts, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses seem successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were incarcerated last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
“It has capacity for up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
“But none of them are asking for that model of so many seats because it’s for private family flights or for presidents of a company.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire’s Fair, a four-day orgy of consumption held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract new wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany-clad yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche on the next stand."
“It’s a beautiful car, but it’s nickel and boiler compared to us,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to gather in Europe, where they were seen as materialistic,” says Marshall Goldman, a senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world’s biggest consumers and spenders.”
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is hosted by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree wealthy include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweller.
She attends the fair for the first time alongside the brand’s Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday evening, dressed in an afternoon suit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit she wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum feather cutters, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund’s teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically in a stand of Delft's royal porcelain, in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
“Of course, the Russians are more interested in ‘bling-bling’.
In fact, sellers said wealthy Russians with more track record (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from eye-catching logos to limited-edition brands, which would not be on display at a trade show.
However, several thousand people – cash millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists – fill the aisles every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of the King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress sets of $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three chain bracelet-shaped car grilles to Rolls Royce Phantom for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded in Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconia cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it’s not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who weren’t millionaires could at least pretend to be rich for the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with stacks of fake $1 million bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire’s Fair.
Visitors would stop to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their phones while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of million.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev says.
‘Shrink’ Surgery Could Cause Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the “A Little Healthier” restaurant window and saw an ambulance climb up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
“Then I saw the ambulance go up,” said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant’s supervisor, on Wednesday.
“That’s when I knew someone was dead.”
Authorities learned the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue home.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, but they are waiting for the toxicology test, although the results will not be available until a few weeks later, to help solve the mysterious death that has plagued the upper ranks of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy says of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for U.S. District Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
“That’s one of the possibilities,” Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 p.m.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
It has been more than a week and authorities have said little about his investigation or about the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not tell whether Mrs. Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door to Mrs. Castro’s home, where a withered rose bush stands at the front of the house, and a Dalmatian bark at the back.
A blue drum labeled "vanillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - stood at the door of the garage, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this one or that one,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock market.
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm credit conditions with cuts to interest rates, which increased with reassuring comments from the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
Stock markets have been loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Ben Bernanke’s No. 2 reserve chairman Donald Kohn declared that policymakers must be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to continued financial market tensions.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was “partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and during October.”
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales hitting a record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, at close to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at close to 6.306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of Britain’s top companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, the resurgence of credit stress in the markets was highlighted after a strong demand in a three-month fund auction by the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained credit and three-month “Libor” lending rates among British banks, meant the biggest increase since September, by 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England sues Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the team that is on loan – with that particular title at least – is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is starting to fill with offers to become a national selector, and if not, a part time.
The one who does not get the sixth place batting will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and the sport as well.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than for ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, as judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, had been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level is for a cricket player, unless they give him a chance to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a big influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time as taking a "wicket" and a batter to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to make an impact as a player one day.
But catching the eye of the coaches is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself to "fit and bowls" as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more from them.
The games of Shah or Bopara at Asgiriya Stadium may be just a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a player of importance, and despite scoring a hundred double against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The odds are that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over young Bopara’s exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah’s favor is his brilliant and valuable debut test in early 88’s Bombay, 32 hundred first class versus only 6 Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent track record against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two rounds in May against West Indias in testing at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from the pickers when Vaughan claimed his spot for the next match, seeming to have taken some momentum from his batting that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has the joy of living in swords.
He gets caught up in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he flipped his vehicle at an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at the distance, to say with excitement, “Did you see that?”
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work – and to the fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who hoped the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and what is safe now.”
“They say Mahdi’s army stopped killing people,” he said, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to temporarily cease.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with her two children because it was impossible to renew her visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in her country.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped pull al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my comrades.”
"That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops entrenched groups of armed “concerned citizens” who work in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned because of visa denials and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian gangs of death.
“We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shia areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will re-emerge sectarian tensions and the struggle will begin.
The small Saar, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, Sarlanders lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlian that we are not French" - that was the ironic moto about themselves of the smallest federal state for his fiftieth birthday.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a large role in the educational system of the Saar that in a study of the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
In this way, high schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students coming from the Saarland is higher than the average in higher schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
“The system of vocational education is exploited in the Saarland,” says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than five out of five young people are in high school, so the Saarland is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of the Saarland forced higher schools to advertise more for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in general education schools,” a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education said.
Thus the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
In order for the children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, this one has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students behind in school development decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But overall, the Saar did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students can calculate better.
To the displeasure of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although Saarlanders are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject at the Secondary Schools.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez lets change the time in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is currently staying as a comedian in Spain.
As the Bolet<0xC3><0xAD>n Oficial del Estado Venezuelan has reported, under the new law, the hour will pass to less than four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would in his day impose the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced the rupture of relations with his neighbor Colombia because of the action with hostage-taking.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
“My dignity doesn’t allow me to do that,” says Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where the country’s citizens must decide Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, his power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chavez’s mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas on the release of the hostages.
Chavez said Sunday that Uribe’s decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chavez in Spain.
A new ringtone causes a sensation in the country: “Why don’t you shut up?”, is the phrase that half a million people have already downloaded.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions by the populists of the left at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong economic situation.
Experts present a wealth of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to calculations by the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real-wage account in 2007 than the previous year.
"The fault for that is the weak evolution of wages, the rise in value added tax and the tightening of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Research on business cycles told the "Bild" newspaper.
Also the new unemployment insurance charges can correspond to the employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% as it passes from one year to the next, is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the labour office does not have to get into an unpleasant situation again, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the petroleum derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, these are increasing by 3%.
Venus: Earth's twin brother.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that until now had not been posed. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered lightning in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, the same that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers suspected that lightning could exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays shut off from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, tells Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms may have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it is not so: if there were ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface temperatures of 500<0xC2><0xB0>C reign, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
"Possibly, Venus is an Earth's 'devil' twin, but it's still a twin," Russell said.
The main goal of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so Earth-like in mass and size, has evolved so differently.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of research to be presented in many Nature papers, according to the researchers, underscore not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with Earth than we had assumed," the ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, the researchers also discovered in the south polar region a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the upper terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet also called a sunrise star or evening star orbits the Sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not closely resemble Earth, scientists take it as a basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets water had agglomerated which on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus dissociated into the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel’s rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the fight between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the September rally.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, cares about Germany’s reputation and therefore demanded that the grand coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation,” Koehler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
“Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute validity for me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received when carrying out a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly expressed his displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the Finance Minister of Germany, but also, according to information sources in the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception by the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the religious leader from Tibetans in their official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not take to the streets.
Barricades were made, vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious riots involving young people in France, the Federal Minister of Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We also need to make sure that our country’s social problems don’t take the form of violence.”
"We have to take that seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" newspaper, published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits.”
It is still early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same edifying and sociological problems as in France.
The youths staged serious street riots with police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolouse.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above average.
More vocational training positions must be taken care of.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, “But in spite of everything, we have to be careful.”
It is necessary to "provide an opportunity for young people to receive a job or vocational training more quickly".
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police officers participated in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
Responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as rubbish and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been in charge of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Home Affairs Minister, announced that police will take rigorous action until necessary.
On Monday night, about 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot began in a traffic accident on Sunday, in which two young men were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the young people was not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
Acting far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more is to be expected from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate, indifferent and contentless performance in the general debate of the Lower House it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach that was made to him for having repeatedly devoted himself to actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he does not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the lower house it was very clearly stated to all that this reproach was appropriate.
There could be no interest, no feeling whatsoever, in the problems of the country.
But instead, <0xC3><0x81>ngela Wolke presented herself like this: a very high policy that flees foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself very much for the decisions made at Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these goals should be achieved here on climate issues.
In general, this way of praising herself – for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford such modesty.
It is committed to expressions so that an impulse can reach people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going off the branch.
But in Angela Wolke’s kingdom, inner problems are appearances of little value.
Child poverty and concerns for low-wage workers?
The only thing he does is talk about this subject using subordinate sentences.
It is amazing how many times you are wrong when talking when it comes to the supplement for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
He begins to stumble "as if he had been in an unknown territory", when it came to more concrete information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of Republican presidential pre-candidates on YouTube and now must fear only one candidate from outside.
Tensions between the candidates are evident from the outset.
Mitt Romney accused his adversary Rudy Giuliani of making New York a “place of refuge for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani responded with grave reproaches: "I would like to say that his own home was a 'port' for the illegals." Giuliani responded to the former Massachusetts governor by saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans does not have a clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their adversaries.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were uploaded to Youtube, don’t have much content either.
“With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” that was John McCain’s reproach to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one at the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from Vietnam war veterans, when he refuses to recognize as torture "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg, Florida show that meanwhile the campaign’s most important topics are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates over torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied raising taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“At that time I was wrong,” Romney said, apologizing to people and the television audience for being an advocate for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf ruled without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he seized power with a bloodless military coup, the former general rules the state for the first time as civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the attorney general of the state, after the oath Musharraf will very soon annul the state of emergency and will fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since he was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court there have been many jurists who supported Musharraf. Last week the country's Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release, a copy of "Live 1974" was made, which was written in the band's best time.
At that time, they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of him his box, his cables and above all his buttons.
In the middle sits 63-year-old Dieter Moebius, dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking out of the auditorium, is 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Rodelius, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for the Krautrock fans was the fact that the band Harmonia came back to make music.
What we have to rebel against here is this: the questions have precisely shown that the name of the band resonated in the minds of people, but it was not something so special that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the Krautrock misconception was always more valued in England and the United States than in its own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of Cologne's Can 2003 band for their life work, the room could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths with amazement.
Later Michael Rother spent time onstage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend.
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and at that time did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
A while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a time, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that was too radical at the time.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians from Cluster in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the sixteenth century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was rather an artist’s life full of surprises.
They say one day an Ottenstein Harmonia singing association pen appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against the customs.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up meddling in esoteric themes and securing his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and since then has been more successful than Harmonia.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to thank Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set out to cultivate this own German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius's work, the band Neu! was again discovered.
Harmonia’s performance as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all Krautrock influences to the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno’s phrase accompanied by the special music fills the room: “This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in the black-and-white photo projections, where instruments with wires are seen.
In the background are three veterans who began to improvise again.
They do nothing but attach the microphones to the organ and the battery in order to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Today, electronic music is the way it should have been.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment you cough, whisper and in a good moment of emphasis you sing "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia remains calm.
On the stage we reflect very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music begin and end?
That can break one’s nerves or give one a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two didn’t have much conviction.
Either the concepts are fixed a lot on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can also not help in this case.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding on the Balkan mountain, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the handsomest man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument for perhaps watching the movie “The Hunting Party—when a hunter becomes what he’s chasing” (Why do movie titles have to be so long and crazy these days?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the eye: deep down, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decadence retained until now most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a nutshell: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riegelt) who want to save a Serbian from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very fast and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The film's meaning is lost by the actions and shootings, although we welcome the fact that the Serbs are not once again presented as the sole culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because in reality there was never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard on two counts), the story about American reporters in the war going to detect a war criminal Serb called "fox," could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now."
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army can not do and each time it turns out a trip insane.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first we are introduced to Simon Hunt, to whom they do not let him be simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also envisions a love affair with a Bosnian Muslim who will be killed later.
Then “The Hunting Party” is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with impressive speed achieve what could not be achieved for five years by NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters in the world, which was to capture the war criminal and leave them to the Bosnian Muslims to get revenge in a fair way.
It is so bad, they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in reality, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and emphasizes that the Americans and the French are not really worried about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war films in the Balkans.
He recently published in a newspaper that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always there is a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or the minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Across All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bloody Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It has to take at least decades until Hollywood rolls out a good holocaust movie with Schindler's List as an example.
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the works about the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because scriptwriters don’t have the slightest qualms (which is necessary to be able to) about telling good stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Great Dictator” turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn’t know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn’t be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look at an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change."
The big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives in response negative criticism about the Olympics.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and the economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg chamber of commerce, said Wednesday the resignation was "not good for the economic site".
In recent times no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, we could not keep the political, sporting momentum at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
Mayor Ole von Beust said on Wednesday that Hamburg's ambitions for the organization of the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but the German Olympic Sports Federation decides," von Beust says in the WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December, on Munich's application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we had until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance.”
Despite everything, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut’s statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
“It’s too soon to let go of the opportunity, if at this point the plans are ruined,” HSB director Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Sport Federation of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for universities in 2015 not as a "replacement" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sports Federation of Higher Schools named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate for not taking such valuable time to build houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was delaying the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympics or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for little Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg’s request for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever links the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the list of works of Warhol.
Most of the ninety-four Bright-Box "type" on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm carried out internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén museum gave to the Moderna Museet museum, are also fake, and almost a hundred others are in circulation.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that had cartons of soap powder "Brillo".
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his 1968 works in the Moderna Museet museum hundreds of Glitter-cardboard boxes were exhibited. These were not made by Warhol (due to expenses), but were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillo".
These were not works of art, but examples (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden some Shine-wooden boxes, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museet museum.
Witnesses of that time now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Stockholm-type" "Brilliant-Boxes" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost one hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the curators of the Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the tightened silvers. Also it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol’s Brilliance-Boxes,” says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet Museum and adds that if the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York fails to reach any conclusions, the Moderna Museet Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exhibition objects.
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in that they are soap powder boxes.
But from that moment everything remained silent.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter he could not answer for bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been entrenched in the building for a few hours.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial Thursday for having attempted a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Obviously the military police officers who were to watch him had passed into his ranks and followed his mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Hotel Noble.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Advisor, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
“People are fed up,” Trillanes said.
“We invite people to join our ranks.”
Gen. Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow suit.
Major government critics called for a major rally against the president on Thursday.
For months his government has been criticized for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention due to the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company's takeover.
There are also options to further increase the financial part at Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday they already made the assumptions about entering the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution maintains equity securities for a third-party partner.
United Internet already in the previous day involved with almost 10 per cent to the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital expansion measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on DSL-products marketing cooperation.
“We are strengthening our collaboration,” the United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, they involve 18.49 per hundreds of Freenet.
That meant both companies kept all options, especially participation in the Freenet corporation.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This “game” with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held directly 6.01 percent of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch is going to get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
