UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from five countries permanently present on the council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - this month on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers “made this situation unresolved.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures in polls that show Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
Others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to topple Donald Trump from the polls, it hasn’t worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads by a double-digit percentage and some voices are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate mogul’s chances of appointment.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the Republican nomination race.
Pundits shows that in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made way for Herman Cain in polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit to Trump’s power and start supporting him with money.
Here are some figures from recent surveys that suggest that real estate mogul is not just a passing thing:
Figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures remain.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa found that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for the nomination.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be “enthusiastic” or “grateful” if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only two in 10 say they would be “sorry” if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Ben Carson alone generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be “enthusiastic” compared to 40% who say the same about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “unpleased” or “angry” if favorite Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
We find the same figures in Iowa, where 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to lead, according to a Quinnipiac poll last week.
However, 44 percent say he lacks the personality to act effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament has nothing to do with the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, when asked who is most likely to win the race for the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: In the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared to only 28 percent for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans have retreated to another candidate. Trump is still at the forefront of all.
Some voices say the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while support against Trump will spread to more than twelve candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush and 33 points behind Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who wins?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have made up their minds.
A new poll conducted by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they are not changing their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump’s biggest adversary is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it’s twice as likely as voters who say they’ve decided to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus of his 2016 campaign.
Some are worried that Trump’s bombastic style will lead to a split between prominent Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it looks like as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters, largely because of their status as outsiders.
According to the ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry with the authorities in Washington.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of Republicans in COngres, with 54 percent saying they are “unpleased” and 21 percent “nervous at the top.”
Jeremy Corbyn makes his Prime Minister's Questions debut
Ever since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut at the PMQs has been long-awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will later make his Prime Minister's Questions debut, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely examined by the media and Labour MPs.
In his weekly appearances, he called for "less theatre and more deeds".
He also said that he can give up a few participations and that he gives them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in a leading position, coming after he called it a "ghost cabinet" and after a speech he gave Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to keep quiet at the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative lawmakers and kept the front page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "kept the silence respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would recommend the Labour leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the shadow cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leading team, arguing for differences of opinion on economics, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are "cumulating" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment on his position towards the European Union and the benefits limit.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely remove the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Smith, the Labour and Pensions Minister, said the party "is very clear" in its exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "head" level from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron at the rostrum in the last decade since taking over the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from outside sources" for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
MP Islington North said PMQs involved too much confrontation and would refrain from retaliation and attacks, pledging instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, would take his place at the PMQs when he cannot participate – for example when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying that he approached the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took office, Cameron said he wanted to give up the "Punch and Judy" political style often associated with the PMQs, but admitted a few years later that he had failed to do so.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he leads the Chamber of Deputies, and his position among fellow MPs, although critics say it has become a caricature and needs deep reform.
"Framework in Joburg": Homeless young people benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as children found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
“I Was Shot in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas they live in and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Head of JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says an increase in the minimum wage in the UK could mean “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But that purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the higher costs for the workforce within the firm, he says.
The costs could impact JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral victim in the "storm" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior is rather praiseworthy than critical, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often referred to as "Special Ks," was unsavoryly dragged into the spotlight by Kyrgios' scandalous skid over Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a crippling qualifying match shortly after, in Cincinnati, the referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have knocked this Kyrgios down, and I should have knocked him down."
Although he was last seen doing a powder rocket after having muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second place on singles, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
“One thing I feel strongly about is that in my opinion Thanasi was drawn a little bit into the conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a missile when he lost because he was accusing cramps in the US, but he is not the first player to break a missile out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he would not be proud of it.
But let’s face it, he’s done extremely well in pretty challenging situations in the U.S. with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He has a great team, he has a great family next door and I think he was treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and has integrated into the team, he has had no conflict with other players, he is highly respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he is in excellent shape, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged exclusively on the basis of his qualities and flaws.
Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the big draw, which starts on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the best fit for everyone, but supported the long-term return of the Canberra native to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw and not think about the controversy around [Kyrgios] at all,” Healy said.
And I think Nick climbed very fast, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he matures in the public eye and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his deeds, and I think he needs a time that he can’t be at the center.
2016 Elections: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-figure lead in the Democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will run for president, is backed by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton supporters are more steadfast in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS news poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has diminished.
Men’s support has dropped considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton’s lead among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now standing on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in the lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight 5 point lead in this group.
Approximately half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run for the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton’s current supporters will be enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republicans who say the same about top-ranked Donald Trump (35 percent) is lower.
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question about why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential bid, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him race – though a third think he shouldn’t run.
When asked about the second option for the party's representative, Democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second option, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn’t run.
Fifty-five percent of Democrats consider Clinton the most likely candidate to win the general election, but the numbers have dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is at a distance in second place but the percentage according to which he is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer issues over eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in terms of some key features compared to the primary voters of their party.
The majority of voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trust, and to have solid leadership qualities.
Biden is seen as the best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democrats don’t believe H. Clinton is integrity and trustworthiness, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t think about him.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
Regarding all of these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation on the subject and say it has not affected their overall view of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion split in March on this issue, shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy hasn’t affected their overall view of Clinton, although 36 percent say they’ve changed their view to the negative.
Mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their views on Clinton in the negative.
Although Democrats consider Clinton to be integrity and trustworthy, this continues to raise concerns among voters at the general level: only 32 percent consider her integrity and trustworthy, 8 percent less than last month and 15 percent less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it integrity and trust.
At the same time, 55 percent of national voters do not consider Trump to be integrity and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders to be integral is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, but, as in Carson's case, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternity indicted for the murder of the student in year 1 of Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put a 14-kilogram backpack full of sand behind him, and repeatedly beaten as he tried to reach a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng charged with headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call the emergency number after he fainted and claimed to have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
But they found time to change Deng’s clothes, search for his symptoms on Google, and contact Andy Meng, the brotherhood’s national president, to seek his advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, members began to hide personal possessions and practically put the good of the brotherhood before the good of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to his head, trunk and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated by fraternity rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life each year because of rituals,” Douglas Fierberg, Deng’s family lawyer, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe District Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with rape and complicity in murder.
“We want to hold not only the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization that has authorized the fraternity, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable,” Wagner said at a news conference.
The Baruch faculty banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will stumble, the yield on bonds will increase and the economy will enter recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
In economics, history offers few indications of time frame.
After the first increase in interest rates, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when the interest rate starts to rise, but on the trajectory of the time required for normalization.
There are multiple variables in the game.
But in the end, market players might find that all the excitement about rising interest rates has been exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the ‘cheap money’ era,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Below we present how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has been facing in recent months, anticipating rising interest rates can volatilize things for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There appears to be a trend for capital profitability to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the lag in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed’s increases.
More precisely, over the past 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by about 14 percent - heading towards an interest rate increase, quite invariable in the 250-day period after (average rise of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the management strategist Nuefset.
Deutsche said the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and benefits are starting to decline.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to this.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before and could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will approach its all-time low for an increase in the Fed’s interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question “if this time it’s different,” Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing for a year-long growth decision by the Fed, with all eyes on this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission ending Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an interest rate hike at the meeting, futures trading indicates a probability of only 25%.
“In our post-1950 study, all interest rate growth cycles to date have been in a super profit growth cycle, with GDP eclipsed pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery began,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery from the worst recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in interest rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster on bonds than on stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the yield on bonds drops immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that these interest rate increases will bring yields closer between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds do better in such an environment, although “we are still cautious about forcing profitability,” Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy,” Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is straighter, the spread of the average credit rate has expanded and volatility has increased – all market features when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, U.S.-dominated companies will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Large-debt multinationals will suffer because the growth of the dollar will lead to the price of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate increase,” Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital and low-volatility stocks also outperformed similar companies of lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the growth of the dollar.
Those who save could also gain, although experts disagree about how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the radio station for "fooling"
He claims to be more and more similar to his commercial opponent.
He also took to the eyes of the BBC Music Awards, claiming to have plagiarized the Brits awards
Col. Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that this show is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is “transforming into” Classic FM, a senior MP said, putting pressure on the station to prove it is doing something commercial stations don’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's chiefs that the public radio station "fools" and is increasingly resembling the commercial adversary.
“I feel like Radio 3 is ‘crazy’ – although I don’t like to use the word – but I feel like it’s turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also took to the eyes BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, appear to be Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different – these are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what’s already on the market,” said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC's chief executive has denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anything about classical music on Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production is unrivalled.
“In addition, I think Radio 3’s commitment to discovering new music and allocating new songs is also important,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to make more efforts to attract audiences over the previous period because the British had less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC logo criticized at the Culture, Media and Sports Committee meeting for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for around <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about the show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be done "in a BBC-specific manner."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find the golden-egg chicken in its own ogre" the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban future seasons of The Voice or spend the money going on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the slightest increase in August, and Black Friday could be the culprit
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month saw the slowest growth since 2000.
Online sales gained momentum three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to shop.
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday could lead to reluctance to spend.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain’s shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the smallest increase since 2000 to date, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating a rise of just 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a trend of streamlining over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales gained momentum three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phone to shop.
Thus, the number of people who could shop online increased and could do so under various circumstances, such as from the couch.
But now that it stagnates a little, you might notice a decrease (in growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers crammed into computers to get their hands on the deals, which led to the collapse of several retailers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers have been battling over bargains, could cause buyers’ reluctance.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 is spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion stores in shopping areas.
After Bin Laden family sanction, Muslims bury victims killed in Mecca crane crash
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were strolled through the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the crash.
The health minister said a total of 394 people were injured in the crane crash.
In the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane crash at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, mourners gathered on the road to express their condolences, until the first dead arrived at the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the bin Laden family construction group for the disaster, which also claimed 394 wounded.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane that collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not provide the details, but said the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the crane crash and Group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
The royal decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date security measures and coordinating its work with meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque in Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is carrying out major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's last leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade" son, disinherited by his family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in conditions of strong wind and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased victims would receive one million Saudi Riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) and the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other injured will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of converting credits into Swiss francs
On the banking market, two offers for converting loans into lei in Swiss francs have already appeared, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest rates can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting the loans granted by Volksbank into francs, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to data compiled by analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest at lei, of 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, Banca Transilvania’s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of clients with loans in francs due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced with the value of the risk and administration commissions paid by the client, then an additional 22.5% reduction was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to the equivalent monthly plateau in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
BENEFITS
The main advantage of the lei coverage of loans in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from future franc increases, and the reimbursement of the credit will be made in the currency in which he collects his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that no reassessment of the property is made, no additional guarantees are required, and no further proof of income is required.
Basically, a new financial and legal analysis of the credit will not be made, nor will there be additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer a discount at the monthly rate, compared to how much customers pay before conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first few years is made up more of the interest, and the customer pays back very little of the principal.
The Bancpost offer with very low interest rates in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
However, it is not known how this rate will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest is that the ROBOR index will grow significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor index - CHF).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached the value of 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, there may be other costs not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for interest rate decisions for the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The world is looking ahead to its scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, slightly more than half who last week thought the decision would be made, now believe the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current 0-0.25% range.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less rosy global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
People who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 she struggled with leukemia and in 2009 she lost her life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this certainly has a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw has been on the stand for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right foot in Manchester United's Champions League game, which ended in a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player’s eyes and will keep him on the line for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury came as a result of a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after 20-year-old Shaw broke PSV's defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: “He has a double fracture in his leg and is in the hospital.”
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow, then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
"It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he's having difficulties, then he's playing fantastic and now something like this is happening.
The oxygen mask was put in the locker room.
She was crying.
I am not a doctor, but at double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and got rid of the red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when they say it's foul and red card.
It was a very ugly intervention with two legs.
A message on Shaw’s Twitter account: “Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I begin the road to recovery, I will come back stronger.”
Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat
The England defender has an extra reason to recuperate to play at the French European Championship next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to injure an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexican national team against the Dutch national team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very difficult because he didn’t intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it’s a very serious injury, it’s not good,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I could only see the ball, which was going in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it but I couldn’t see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through such a thing.
I feel really bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England’s omission but is still holding on
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but, after seeing England’s selected team for the tournament, I do not consider a 3-0 repeat defeat in the test matches.
I wouldn't even eliminate the option of a win on the move.
Alastair Cook’s team may have less experience than three years ago but they have good players on the spin in the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youth attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Adam Lyth left the England team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, I find it difficult to consider the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played all seven test matches against two good strikers in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no question marks related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because – and I’ve said that before – the players are their own pickers.
Some fifty years and Lyth may have prolonged his run but his destiny lies in his hands.
I hope that if he does more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when his performance wasn’t up to his capacity and I’m not surprised; first of all, he’s a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long a batsman is noticed in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had any luck at home and on the go.
The only dissatisfaction you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean tour – when Lyth was in top form – but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
Alex Hales, a batsman I rate very well, comes into the team.
He's a cricket player who has the "X-factor" that I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open the fight with Cook, which would lead to extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already proven he's fucked up.
Moeen may not have brought success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches as the first drop before entering the open in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari joins the team as a back-up spinner and, although I had limited contact with him, I was impressed that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his early age - with an average of 31 on the beat and 35 on the ball - and they might think he's ready, but there's not a bunch of spinners and the pickers have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot from this tour.
England also made some changes to the coaching team.
Appointing Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lankan batsman, to the position of consultant for the test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the tournament’s white-ball leg and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham’s teammate Ben Stokes is resting for the one-day games, Root has received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and coaches do not make the program.
And you have to remember, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never made easily.
Brexit camp could win if economy stays calm by 2017
As the day goes by, David Cameron’s renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting harder and harder, even without Jeremy’s brilliant choice of “Yes or No?” Corbyn at the helm of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
Aliens also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in recent days that – immersed in crises similar to those in the EU – not all of them being provoked domestically – some Member States are fueled by Britain’s agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, at its annual meeting, the TUC decided that they would not want this either if it eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George’s “selfie” agenda.
The prime minister and the chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK with an outward perspective under the EU roof – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” Berlin says – suggests that several obtuse ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don’t care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in the lead for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation shakes, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have stayed too long.
In 2017, French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers may even plan to intentionally make remarks that do not help, in the style of the SNP, in the campaign for the UK referendum in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "the UK got nothing of value from the renegotiation".
Europeans know in their own skin just how overwhelming Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the barons in the oligarchic press are who look at the EU with skepticism because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a correspondent for Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of unpaid thugs, phone-frauding foreigners and pseudo-non-domes who own most major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them pretty much the same, but he realized that when you’re locked up in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from thinking about eating lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron’s idea of a referendum, given that Blair made a concession on principle to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press hasn't forgiven him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on his back Monday at Westminster — I told him to stop consuming his time with me — seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock’s 1980s boycott strategy from the egg, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position on the BBC left her vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position towards Europe is what I would indulgently call evolution.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservative “anglicism” might agree with that.
That's what Hilary told Benn on radio and TV this week, when the scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as a "shadow" minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to fellow Labour members, without going too far and without losing his office in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to stay “in any situation” — Benn’s expression — doesn’t match what McDonnell said or what JC said to colleagues and lawmakers at the private Monday night meeting.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he also sensitized me - the discipline of messages remains important in the television era and especially in the whirlwind of social networks, an outbreak of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right that Cameron should not be given a note of favor in Europe, allowing him to take Labour’s support for the referendum campaign as good, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin’s basic sophism about EU membership – consistent with their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophism about NATO – Tom Watson is unwavering that JC will not campaign for resignation – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin be squandering political capital – and there are suspicious voters – for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed in Britain’s weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize the decision of the Public Health Department of England on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with ties to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Public Health Department of England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “reference” report last month and described it as a “complex analysis of evidence.”
But some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the “extraordinarily fragile foundation” on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in the BMJ have questioned the claims and their basis “on solid soil or moving sand”.
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said they expect PHE claims that “current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and patterns.
In fact, a single meeting involving 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) that synthesized their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received funding in the past from British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting stated the funding received from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding reported to have been received from cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but among them are a few known "faces" in the production of e-cigarettes, some of them even state in the paper the financing of the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control section of the PHE.
The group’s research work “convincingly masks” the lack of “solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have by most criteria,” McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “to date there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department at PHE, says that he has responded to BMJ’s claims in the past.
He said, “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have smoked all their lives loses their lives because of this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that e-cigarettes pose a comparatively minor health risk, but we need to continue to study their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about information that is and is not evidenced, in particular in view of the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people die from a smoking-associated disease and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion.
By clearly expressing the current evidence - that although the use of e-cigarettes is not without risk, they only present a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

Advertisements that shame Britain's arms trade
Watch the Amnesty International film against the arms fair.
Terrible killer drones!
Beasts for crushing ankles!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric sticks that cause creepy pain without leaving a trace!
The cheerful voice and the animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world’s largest arms fair is a fierce charade, carried out by Amnesty International to underline the desire of British authorities to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.
DSEI Arms Fair: Authoritarian Regimes Arrive in London
But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and subways that needed a second look.
“Important announcement, are you traveling with DLR between September 15 and 18?” says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London Underground, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will crash on DLR Customers are being asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited their work at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using Ad Space Hack Packs, a six-pound package of Allen keys that it claims “facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stations on the planet.”
The London transport director is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are going to collaborate with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets commuters traveling by subway.
The film made by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP which worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and voice artist also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the gun show ad – with an empty space in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s offer them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with making a more realistic advertisement but "enriching it with strong animations and colors, it was more striking".
“They did a great job helping us increase interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair,” said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty International.
Now, the UK authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the theme of the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order it received from the U.S. military regarding “AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher.”
This includes “a uniquely shaped spotlight that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in the home
It’s been 11 years since I moved into the home when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but I can only now remember the forced smiles of those we annoyed – and the many complaints about others.

Moving to the home can bring conditions that range from nervous breakdown to horror.
The chatter is tempting: tell people where you come from, if and where you spent a year off from school, what you think of Corbyn, and why “sincerely, you don’t care about Marmite because, really guys, it’s nothing but yeast extract HAHAHA, you find me in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others breathe – ask questions and show interest.
They animate the conversation and help you differentiate people you like from those you wouldn’t even talk to if the flood came and they would be the only ones who would have boats.
Do not suffocate people.
Bedrooms often abound with drinking parties, movie nights and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and try their underwear.

Violinist David Grimal: In Bach’s time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less ordinary, quite "weird" project, as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor on it.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a Monday, when the cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu were not lacking.
Both performances, held on the stage of the Athenaeum, showed the audience a different way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, being, at the time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It’s true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra – I’m talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
They feel like they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all the musical fetishization focuses on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
We are no longer talking about music.
So if we look at this world, we have on the one hand skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can’t listen, but has to look, which is stupid again,” Grimal said.
The violinist recounts that this change in the way he makes music came after the "musical disappointments" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and to bring money and music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and fraternity in this system.
So I haven't found any sense to continue on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at the time no one did this without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
“How do you imagine doing marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego anymore?” the artist asks.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", noting that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be a hindrance in the musical act: "Interestingly, the more we sang a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not only in the role", Grimal argues, adding as to the Sunday performance "I was on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very courageous one", precisely because he invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where there are the largest orchestras in the world who sing and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest in something different, breaking barriers.
Speaking of Enescu’s work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced works by Enescu into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal advocates for changing the way classical music education is done, considering that "musician work, as it is organized today, has an epoch of death" and that "the future of music represents music itself".
We don't need to go around the world five times a year if it's useless.
In Bach's time, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, releasing albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before you entered the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU you had to adopt sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are in the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
Music is the same thing, it’s the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes tomatoes maybe not very beautiful, but when we cut them they are real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should be brought back to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
“If we considered – as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese do – that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning in school, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products,” Grimal said.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician who will play an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to train a soldier, it has to be in a way, if we want to train a musician, it is something else.
What do you think is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?” the French artist asks with a smile.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this status of "soldier", overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert come out smiles".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.

Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: the doubling of two characters from the super-production "Snow Queen 3D"
Do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give her a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to dub two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic drawings the emphasis was placed on bringing the voice of the actor closer to the specifics of the animated character, lately, in the creation of the story, those who are going to interpret the voices are also taken into account, and they are usually well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are launching a brand new campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to register their children for our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
“Children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors,” said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager at Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between September 11 and September 30, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection following which will be chosen 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a demonstration in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the platform petitlevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where they can register their child for the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Afterwards, he must choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then the child will register playing his own dubbing version.
Four films about friendship, fairytale heroes, magic and hope can choose the contestants for the challenge: "Yellow Pens 3D", "World: Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala the 3D Fool" and "Maya Bee 3D".
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will each double a character in the superproduction "The Snow Queen 3D", which will have its premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx Earnings Mixed, 2016 Fiscal Forecast Drops
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, with the delivery giant lowering profit estimates for the entire year as a result of low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its land-based transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company’s shares fell about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the opening bell sounded on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending May next year, 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts predicted the figure to be $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The declining estimate comes despite price increases of 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher surcharges for land transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase year-on-year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said: "The company is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of global production and trade."
The holiday employment plans were announced a day after UPS’s competitor said it plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of jobs it made last year.
In the quarter ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, down from an average estimate of $2.44 per share by 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research survey.
Profit increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who took part in the Zacks survey estimated the amount to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, which has led to stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping jumped the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, ground division revenues increased by 29% but operating revenues stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit experienced an increase in revenues due to higher base tariffs, while the revenues recorded by the freight division decreased due to rising costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares were down $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
At the close on Tuesday, it was down 11 percent year-on-year and 17 percent from its record high on June 11.
At the most anticipated meeting in recent years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it’s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank’s meeting room, will be seen a mural of the United States.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, Fed Chairman, and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has been given a double task by Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the X-factor in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to be rid of the unprecedented stimulus offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place since the end of 2008.
Even though most data points to a strong growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already wary of adding volatility by raising the benchmark to federal funds — even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will pursue,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the growing uncertainty in the global market is enough to give them arguments to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on the Fed’s decision, which in itself is causing instability in the financial market.
Approximately half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate hike this week.
But financial markets are expecting the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30 percent.
This would indicate a fall on the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policymakers mitigated the blow by promising that it would take a long time for the next increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The surge was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep interest rates stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising for the Fed to raise interest rates at this time,” Lonski said.
If Fed policymakers were to do so, they “should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets.”
Other experts said an interest rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percent this month, the first small step toward slow tightening monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an interest rate hike this year despite objections raised by liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wage gains showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fall short of the central bank’s annual target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to fibrillate late this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below its record high in May as investors feared the slowdown in China’s economy would bring down global growth.
The market declined somewhat this month, with the Dow index now about 10% below its May high.
For Fed policymakers, market turmoil adds to the complex calculation of the moment of interest rate growth.
“Without what has happened in the financial markets and news of the weakening Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be more firm in the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he predicts that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy and they almost have no data to rely on after the events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s major interests, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank’s influence has been huge.
The mere allusion of then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “tighten” its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly twinned, it is expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at welfare management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that “The Fed has an oversized history of reacting to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to economic bases.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Commission for the Open Market, a decision-making body that supported interest rate hikes, offered the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that hit Asia prompted the Fed to cut the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the limited identification implications for U.S. development,” Mr. Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to the declines.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market quake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
The last turbulent period did not rise to that level at all, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to end up in a situation where we’re afraid of an interest rate hike because markets are upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, I do not think it should take action prematurely.
Are you looking for a unique Thai market?
Try LAX-C from Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened/opened in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it is in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a universal store offering an astonishing array of fresh, frozen and dehydrated products, popular Thai and Asian snacks and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is also a car park where you need to buy some engine oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to go through all the lanes.
If you are hungry for so much, eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The shop’s interior food district (good, affordable) is close to the houses and offers several options for preparations that can be taken as a package.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything- Thai?
You'll probably find it at LAX-C.
The products have reasonable prices and some items are sold wholesale.
Fresh produce includes herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat ray is large, as is the fish ray - the serving staff will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it if you want.
An important part of the store is dedicated to the huge freezer district, where you will find frozen curry leaves, watermelon and ginger, whole ducks, fish, blood and beef ball, pork carcasses, fish meatballs, traditional sausages, semi-prepared and many more.
Who buys from there: Restaurant owners and chefs, also families and individuals.
On the wide aisles fit both shopping carts and forked carts.
The discovery: fresh Durian fruit right next to the house area.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own shared parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although the chances are that the store will crowd, there is usually no hard place to park.
Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite Nine channel's attempts to broadcast on Today Show about changing party leadership
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson’s urgent move to Canberra to convey the consequences of the changes in the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
Nine Channel's morning broadcast aired from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of several weeks, which included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "crusade" of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today registered a slight increase compared to Monday’s audiences (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were lower than last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise had an average audience of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
For now, in September, Sunrise has an average viewership of 349,000 and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened throughout the morning.
This morning, not only Parliament is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the question!
Published by TODAY Monday, 14 September 2015
The main news was the startling debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to cope alone with a show without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The audience results for last night resoundingly answered “yes.”
The X Factor show broadcast by Seven remained in place with 1,136 million viewers, taking the face of The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000) lightly.
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night of broadcasting The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new general culture show averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The decline in Chase Australia’s second-night ratings will give Nine the unspoken confidence that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested at a Siberian airport.
Because he openly provoked President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at crowds demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to the statements of Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station, and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired shots into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
According to him, 20 police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent clashes triggered on August 10.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in centrally-ruled Nepal for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
In Kathmandu this week, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The Prime Minister continues the exchange of replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm stance on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or armed policemen.
"It is a shame for Europe sec 21 to apply methods from the 30s," said Victor Ponta.
"The prime minister also said that all the dates and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established in the CSAT meeting on Thursday," the prime minister concluded.
NHC announces 60 percent probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A large low-pressure front about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming over the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight-loss surgery may be helpful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight-loss surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be sustained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those following nonsurgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize the mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of weight relative to height, is considered normal in the range 18,5 to 24,9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy — in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI in people who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received non-surgical diabetes treatments remained at nearly the same level, namely 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely cured at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the medically treated group, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured in only 1% and partially in only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean A1c haemoglobin level decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at about 8%.
But this improved “glycemic control”—reflected by improved hemoglobin A1c levels—did not reduce the five-year mortality rate, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), experienced more considerable decreases in BMI (7.4 compared to 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% compared to 2.1%) and had a higher probability of complete remission (16 % vs. 2.1%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on overweight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona School of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29% less likely to die after 15 years compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic aspect for people with BMIs below 35 who were interested in the procedure.
“This is where this paper is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously when the patient’s BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we’re waiting too long before we’re urging people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that short-circuited their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the mother countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current issue of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, devoted to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even of every continent.
He also stressed that, although admirably, Western European countries’ response to the refugee crisis is inadequate for the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It is wonderful to care for several thousand refugees, but we must also think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, to Muslim countries,” he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Regarding the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the September 11 terrorist attacks, saying that the violent response from the US generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of September 11, I conveyed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used force and led to unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested handwashing detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poisoning Center, U.S. anti-poisoning centers have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed high-alcohol hand detergent.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Poisoning Center, cases of handwashing in children under the age of 12 reported at anti-poisoning centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children intentionally drink detergent and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social media.
You can watch movies on YouTube that show teenagers how to drink detergent to make cheap drinks.
It turns out that teenagers mixed the detergent with mouth water with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of detergent.
“A child doesn’t think it’s hurting him,” Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are the fragrant ones.
Hand detergents with strawberry, grape, orange flavor are the most attractive for children.
Hand detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poison center at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones reach them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four sprays of strawberry-flavored hand detergent at school, has arrived at the emergency room for treatment.
She had alcohol 179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was squirming and couldn’t walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
“It was scary,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic wet products or napkins and not to leave the hand detergent out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent that contained an undeclared toxic ingredient.
Sanitary authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in northern New York plotted to poison their “bad” teacher by “putting antibacterial products in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned it in her classroom.
Police said the plan was "insignificant" and referred the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.
Rumour Mill: There are no disagreements at Celtic
Griffiths debunks rumors of Celtic's misunderstandings, with Deila admitting that the Hoops aren't at their best but will recover.
Hearts facing SFA over Neilson's allegations and Warburton wary of January purchases that affected the team's unit
Dons increase the gap from Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half brought Aberdeen a close win over Hamilton at Pittodrie, with Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths debunks rumors of misunderstandings
Rumours arose of disagreements at Celtic, dismantled by the Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure as they prepare to face the Dutch league leaders.
I don’t think we feel the pressure, I think the players can’t wait.
The absence of the Scots in the title race bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ajax's ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands I no longer broadcast Celtic's match summary; why?"
'Cause there's no Rangers in there.
It’s not just about the Rangers coming back.
We are talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s where the interest is.
The tension is high in the Old Firm matches and it’s not just the Scots who want to see these matches.
I will change the situation, Deila promises.
RONNY Deila agreed that Celtic was fighting hard but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
Malmo's defeat and subsequent elimination from the Champions League was followed by defeat to Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now at the top of the standings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: “Celtic have had periods before and will recover.”
We want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel the same way, but we have to move on.
“We need the support of Celtic because that’s how the players get better.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Warburton's Prudence on January Transfers
Despite comments just a few weeks ago that suggested he had identified a few goals for the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he does not want to affect the Ibrox team's unit.
The former Brentford chief said: "The transfer period in January is very different from the summer."
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is the period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could see this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players that are not needed.
Celtic Targets Michu After Withdrawal
The striker from Swansea, Michu, who was associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw at the expiration of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled with ankle problems for two years and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts faces SFA over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3-2, but the defender's red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting, "We didn't question integrity, we didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The Invincible Hibee was picked up after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
“It was a derby and it was the excitement of the moment,” the striker said, adding, “There’s no need to say I’m not coming back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic.”
Tannadic Council trusts Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United still trusts the management team to change the situation – but agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We will bring the boys back into shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy for 'dirty win' over Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team must cling desperately to Hamilton Accies to get a seventh successive league victory, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic due to Adam Rooney's penalty kick in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or the league, and that hasn't won games like that."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while UK rises
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in May-July, while the number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than in the UK, at 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The authorities’ long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with the employment rate rising and the unemployment rate falling.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch as a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll sit in an observer room in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary Execution Hall and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, I am terrified of the idea.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It’s true, journalists can witness executions in America, and because requests usually exceed the number of seats available, a macabre lottery is held to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The elect will look at the execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, plus I developed my own bond with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to have a notebook and a pen with me to write down what I see.
I'll have to try and remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he “could have formulated it better,” but he still thinks I’m wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote about.
He doesn’t tell me what to write and I wouldn’t do it even if he asked me.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international report to be on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files we made.
I will not go back to all the details here.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's very likely not guilty of murder.
I believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
You'll find out from me what it's like to watch a man I like die uselessly.
Peter Moody Claims The Stewards Tried To Spy On Him And Threatens To Withdraw From Racing
Peter Moody claimed that the Racing Victoria stewards tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to immediately retire from racing.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, stating that they were running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the elimination of Lady Tatai from the race because of a treatment given on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the racing field and that he is in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari’s cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about statements about spies and did not want to resemble “the fox that does not reach the grapes”.
“I wasn’t going to say anything about that, and I’ve been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all comes crashing down all of a sudden,” Moody said.
It is known that it continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that I strive to offer them the best.
From the moment they start to think that this is not the case, I have to give up my job as a trainer.
At that point I'll have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whose name I'll tell you if I'm asked - and they offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the work there," Moody told Racing.com.
He obviously thinks I'm a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew it at the time and know it today.
Should I think it's something personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can hold people outside of trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry so bad?
Maybe that's how others see it.
Maybe he has to take my license and throw me away and I have no doubt that the statements I am making now might cause him to think about this variant.
I’m at a point where I don’t care anymore, and that saddens me.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on them and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration grew with the long-running investigation into cobalt testing involving Lidari and the elimination prompted him to say he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the day-of-race rule as "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice was applied to the horses' legs, which violates the rules.
They break the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on her leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which is what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for race day treatment consisting of applying the poultice, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but it has gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled the crash site in Cobram has been arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist produced in Cobram at the end of the week followed by flight from the crash site.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he was seriously injured after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley Highway.
Police said the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to Shepparton police.
He appears to be charged with flight from the scene of the accident, non-delivery of first aid and other road crimes.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized, in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy answers opponents in the wrestling accusations.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the plating tactics his team used as "distorted subjects" brought up by the NRL's top two favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees had allowed Storm players to "take his team over" in Storm's nervously-winning qualifying final on Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland teams weren't very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of the plating tactics approached by his team and said players simply focused on “contact” when plating.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two top coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - we didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us with a 24-2 score," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, only that in the last six weeks we have really focused on contact in plates and thus changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so he’s probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
Funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "enlivening football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett winning the championship in 2010 by playing "dull" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing Saturday night’s game to our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism because it was a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care how black he was under his nail.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider exciting football, especially thanks to the fast young midfielders.
This kind of game you want to play when you have players like that.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play – not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat concerned about the match with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a tougher score-related race compared to the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven't seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more tries, does that mean exciting game?
Or is it exciting to take breaks and not score?
They're plans for me.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend as they have won the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday’s preliminaries final at AAMI Park, tickets going on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used girls' phones to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images of children.
The girl later woke up and noticed the missing phone, which she found in Hogg’s hand while he was sleeping.
She looked in her phone and found the disturbing messages after which she immediately alerted her mother.
After arriving, police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at that address and found “worrying” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to “attract pedophiles” to the Internet before “pretending to be a policeman to scare them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee court: “He said it’s an addiction – that he’s addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to act as a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the stranger who sent him the images and asked the person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to lure.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added: “When the little girl found the messages on her phone, she yelled at her mother and shivered and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant was using his computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, 23-year-old Hogg, based in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of taking or taking indecent pictures of child subjects, and breached conditional release conditions on January 25 this year and did not appear in court at the appearance on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim has asked Hogg not to be registered in the sex offender registry because it can be said that this crime “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, on grounds of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
It was entered in the sex offender registry before the sentence was handed down.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
The video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said they had received anonymous death threats, threatening them not to shun Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
“The message was sent by a hidden number but it is called ‘death,’” he told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the parliamentarians concerned that immunity only applies in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "worried" about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 redundancies
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs as part of the company’s efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year, HP will split on the stock market into two companies, separating the computer and printer division from operations with fast-growing enterprise hardware and services.
Expected deliveries will bring costs of about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure,” said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will contribute to the companies’ transition to the new style of business,” Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and “focus on delivering unrivalled integrated solutions” to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard was split up to produce electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the "Silicon Valley Cradle".
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to adapt to the shift from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus better in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men peaking in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the issue, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to question the culture that keeps men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to succeed in this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to have an effect, it must first of all be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality it is isolation that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values – our inner desire for personal development and friendship – which further affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn’t really buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused attention on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, the moments when they watch football in comfortable chairs, and Ross’ passion for Rachel came from the fact that men are known to be associated with this situation, even though they often avoid fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: “My role of listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who turn to us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old adage of dealing with yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more mechanisms of psychological adaptation in the long term.
The series highlights the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as objective, external intervention through the phone helps people reach moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you attend this weekend at the FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with full playback of the film sets to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends for a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish – all 236 episodes – on the occasion of #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG put Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his Champions League debut match and helped PSG win against Sweden's Malmo.
Next we present the game chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League group series with a reassuring 2-0 victory over Malmo in Tuesday's match at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his Champions League debut on the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the lead although they missed a number of occasions before securing their lead with the goal scored by Cavani in the 61st minute.
Arriving in Group A alongside Real Madrid and Chess Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as the French team’s goal is not only to qualify in the top five but also to improve their path to the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting the chance to be replaced by his hometown team and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and makes a comfortable difference from the next-place finishers, even if there are other things we need to improve throughout the season,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I’m sorry we didn’t manage to score another goal or two.
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury to one of the three changes at the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw at home from Bordeaux in the Ligue 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he jumped at Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defense before kicking unbelievably over Johan Wiland in the long right corner of the gate.
But if anyone expected PSG to win by snapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine starters on national teams, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for the shot of Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed the pace several times, giving a few unnecessary passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts in the first half only and was then replaced by Cavani right after the resumption of the game.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much better at supporting his teammates, his pass being the one that Di Maria sent in a deflected kick by Wiland over the goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's center.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hopes of rebalancing the score, and only a superb stop from Wiland from a distance for David Luiz's rejection kept the final score before newcomer Ezequiel Lavezzi was canceled a goal in overtime.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmö team, Age Hareide, later stated that PSG were a class over and that "the last match we played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I have only played in the Swedish league, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Put your hat down for PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion from stock sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling commodity stock prices, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a sweeping massive debt reduction plan.
The London-listed Glencore said it had sold new shares worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is grappling with collapsing prices on the commodity exchange, as China’s sluggish economic activity influences demand and wreaks havoc on markets.
The preferential underwriting right increased the price of Glencore shares on the London stock exchange in Wednesday morning trades.
Shares rose 2.77% to 131.60 shillings on the FTSE 100, which opened at a 0.69% higher value.
Glencore has revealed the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at a price of 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than Tuesday’s closing price.
It took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concerns about the growth of China’s stagnant economy led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20-40%.
Xi urges wider expansion of global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy needs to open up to the outside world to fuel growth.
“China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving opening-up policies,” Xi said at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and make room for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of regulation of market access, relaxation of customs control policies, encouragement of state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganization of the resident registration system.
According to the declaration, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify the sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through test programs.
According to the declaration, the measure is important because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a business environment based on legislation and offering a wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their businesses.
China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be open to private investment.
“State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimising requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the right of practice of lawyers and educating judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was attended by Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, dissatisfied with the government’s proposal to increase wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the education unions have not reached any results, with the government proposing a 10% salary increase, from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions want a 15% increase, from November, or a 20% increase, from December.
The talks took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The Government’s proposal today did not please us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to summon the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent promised to us today is less for us than we expected.
“In fact, this 10 percent is the money that we have stipulated in our agreement with the government, last year, for 2016,” said Anton Hadar, Alma Mater’s president, at the end of the talks.
Ponta: In the future health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI in which the representatives of the Government will participate to present to the representatives of the confederations in the country the proposal of salary increase, followed by the unionists to decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The prime minister also told trade unionists that the government is trying to send the payroll law to parliament as soon as possible so that it can enter into force on December 1.
The normative act provides for the increase of salaries in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, an increase foreseen in the document to be made exalted, in the following four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the trade unionists full acquittal of the judgments in 2016.
The Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkey’s territorial waters on Tuesday after their boat sank.
Among the victims were 11 women and 5 children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and was heading for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coastguard said it had managed to rescue 249 people in the shipwrecked boat, but their nationality is still unknown.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Over the weekend, 34 migrants, including four babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometres off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it was shipwrecked.
The route has become a popular one lately for immigrants who want to escape war and hardship in countries like Syria or Iraq.
More than 100 stewardesses fired because they were too fat
Air India is firing about 130 stewarts and stewardesses for being overweight, the airline said late last week.
The state-run company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is “ridiculous” and “shocking sexist.”
The mass dismissal is the latest in a ten-year struggle between the company and the more plentiful stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began using charts with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the nine flight attendants deemed "exceptionally overweight", as this "may have an effect on reflexes and may impede the agility necessary to carry out emergency measures".
The stewardesses sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
“All efforts to make them lose weight have failed,” a company spokesman said.

A footballer from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali regarding the promotion of young players.
If the champion’s financier decided to shut down the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, quarterback Paul Papp opened a football school.
"Paul Papp" Academy will operate in the city of Dej, the deserts of the locality being expected to a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to start the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without worrying about material training.
They have to take care of one thing: to play football as well as possible.
Technical details do not have to be their concern.
They need to value their talent.
This is what he wants to make the Football Academy 'Paul Papp'.
"I'm also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children, to show them that he is with them," footballer Papp told dejeanul.ro.
Children up to the age of 11 years are expected at the Starfighter Academy.
The whole party wants the government.
Acting PSD President Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants, this decision will be formalized at the PSD Congress.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If we want to formalize through a congressional decision, we will do the same.
There won't be any emotion about it.
“There were no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that would give someone the insecurity of the government or that would give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in the government, in the current government, with the current prime minister,” Dragnea said at the end of the session of the National Permanent Bureau of the PSD.
The PSD has announced when it will hold a congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, in the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, a clear message is given if the government wants to continue or if the party decides to move into opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce on Monday if I will be running for a congressional post
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he will run for a leadership position at the next Congress.
I will be weighing, on Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is also set.
"I will announce if I will be running for a position in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's session of the PSD National Permanent Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation regarding the announcement of the candidacy has to do with his file, Dragnea said that he did not have this problem.
I don’t have the problem you’re referring to, but I think it’s fair and honest with all my party colleagues to announce a candidacy or not at the time when Congress is formally set.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of the Social Democratic branches proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party’s Executive Committee.

An Italian man was caught at the Bors customs with immigrants hidden in the TIR
Two Sri Lankan nationals were spotted Monday at the Bors customs office trying to illegally cross the border, hiding in a semi-trailer of a freighter driven by an Italian citizen.
It was determined that the two had paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the border police said.
At the specific check, the border guards noticed in the cabin of the truck a large travel bag containing personal belongings for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough check on the means of transport.
On this occasion, border guards discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the truck, between the plastic crates, two males.
The investigation revealed that two 28-year-old men are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
“In the investigations, the young people said they intended to arrive in France, which is why they contacted a countryman, through whom they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they were going to receive 2,000 euros per person,” the statement said.
The two migrants were charged with “criminal work in the area of committing the crime of attempting to fraudulently cross the state border.”
Also, Pompeo B., the 45-year-old Italian who was driving a Renault Magnum car, registered in Romania, carrying plastic crates for an Italian company, was detained for 24 hours, then presented to the Bihor Court with a proposal for preventive arrest.
How Satisfied Are Romanians in Couples: Men versus Women
Most Romanians are satisfied with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study carried out on the occasion of the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents said they were “very satisfied” and “satisfied” with the overall quality of the relationship.
"However, 18% appear to be 'easily unsatisfied' and 'very unsatisfied' in the relationship, and another 18% declare 'adequate,'" the study concludes.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% suitable, 6% very dissatisfied and 8% easily dissatisfied.
In terms of women, 33% said they were satisfied, 24% were very satisfied, 8% were very dissatisfied, 14% were slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
As far as the neutral state (appropriate) is concerned, we see a difference of two percent.
"The same is true in the very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference being the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 percent," the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% spend between two and four hours.
The authors of the study also report that "Romanians feel they need some more adventure in their life (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, trust 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-control".
The study was carried out by Extreme Training between 1 June and 1 September on 1,369 people, with a margin of error of 2.6%.

What Happened to Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep is faced with a crucial decision for her career, as she has to choose whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year as part of the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian technologist only joining the romance at major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to prevail against the capricious sportswoman.
But the Adidas program will end later this year, and Halep must decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or quit.
We still don't know exactly what's going to happen.
We talk and see.
"After Singapore, I'll be able to give an answer," Simona told a news conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, applying for a contract of about $1 million a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession that he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last race Simona and Cahill will work on together is the Singapore Tournament of Champions.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he split from the Romanian national team in the autumn of last year.
The former selectionist confessed that he did not get along with the president of FRF, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national team.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to raise his salary substantially to stay, but was refused.
I'm not sorry I left the national team right now.
Then I was sorry, I left a job behind.
I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector was not normal, I was not respected, I was not respected for my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he did not know me, he found out different opinions from the press about me.
It didn’t change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation was in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and he probably changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to leave.
If he really wanted me to stay, then I proposed a contract extension.
We have about 400 and a few thousand euros a year, I was going to have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, I talked to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finish first in the group," Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team in the autumn of last year, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminary round.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.
Armored and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police detached Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns at the border with Serbia after violent clashes on Wednesday, when water and tear gas cannons were used against immigrants who wanted to enter Serbia despite Hungary having erected a fence with barbed wire.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far 20 policemen have been injured and the ambulance service has taken two children who were injured after they were thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by any means possible," Hungarian Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi's security adviser said.
Police tried to control with water cannons and tear gas crowds of people throwing plastic bottles, stones and pieces of pavement.
Authorities reported that dozens of migrants broke through the fence at the crossing between Roszke and Horgos and managed to break into the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto urged Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" immigrants from the common border.
There are reports according to which the Serbs have also supplemented their law enforcement forces at the border.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest suspended the border crossing from Roszke-Horgos for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted action to close its borders in order to impede the access of immigrants.
If Tuesday announced that next to the barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia will raise one and on the border with Romania, to the vehement protests of Bucharest on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the erection of a fence and on the border with Croatia.
The rare disease a man suffers from
The American Nick Hess was suspected by his family to be an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely stand up and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he did not drink alcohol, it was apparent that he was intoxicated.
When she first accused me of being drunk without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
“But my friends and family thought, ‘Maybe he’s drinking alone, he’s an alcoholic in secret,'” he said.
When he saw the footage of his wife with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, he simply didn’t recognize himself: “I was looking into my eyes and I wasn’t there.”
"It was awful, I didn't remember anything."
In addition, his wife, who, although she doubted him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath also smelled of alcohol.
The moment that most struck Nick was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had an alcoholemia three times above the legal threshold, although the night before he had consumed only a single beer.
After years and countless investigations, it has been discovered that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, Auto-brewery syndrome.
Basically, your body causes all the carbohydrates you consume to ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected this could be Nick's illness was actually his wife.
The disease doesn’t have a cure yet, but since he gave up carbohydrates, Nick hasn’t had such episodes.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club.
A South Korean man destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest at his dealer’s services.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be taken out of use.
The entire scene was filmed, and the video reached the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and his family.
His anger arose when the dealer from which he bought the car did not solve the problem, as had been agreed.
On Wednesday, the government approved the “National Immigration Strategy for 2015-2018” and the “Action Plan for the current year”, documents considered to be “another stage that Romania is going through as part of efforts to modernize the process of managing immigration on national territory”, according to a press release.
The strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action that reflect the policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
Considering the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are envisaged for the unitary and coherent management of the situations determined by the possible occurrence of an influx of illegal immigrants on the territory of Romania, generated by crisis situations of a political, social, economic or military nature.
"The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay special attention to citizens from countries with potential migration or that may harm national security," the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reviving the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and escalating the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, stricter controls of the legality of the residence of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access on the Romanian territory of third-country nationals who respond to employment needs, facilitating access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the Action Plan for 2015, the Government considers that it is "a means by which concrete activities are established that lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon".
Romania, in a European top on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the largest increase in total labour costs among European Union Member States in the second quarter of the year compared to the similar period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to employers' staff expenditure.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total cost of labour rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania ranks third in the EU in increasing labour costs
The highest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where the hourly labour cost fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The increase in labor costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labor in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% in the hourly labour cost.
Report of activity of TVR management, rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
The Parliament’s culture committees on Wednesday rejected the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014.
To reject the report, 17 MPs voted, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report shall be forwarded to the Standing Bureaus meeting.
They will decide, probably next week.
The next plenary meeting will be discussed.
"I think that in view of this situation will be done relatively quickly," said the chairman of the Senate Culture Committee, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was common sense" that the TVR leadership be present at this meeting, as no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was common sense to be present with the leadership of TVR because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to the CA members since last night, with an approximate hour that we did not know the time, but today, after the meeting of the Bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the management of TVR inviting it.
I believe that at the moment you are convened, you are a budgetary salaried, paid from public taxes and are summoned to a meeting of the committees, even if you do not like them alive.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution subordinate to Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of the Parliament's Culture Committees.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw as they continued, came with the idea that this year would be up to date, but they did not pay off the historical ones.
“I would remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else’s fault that the fun with the banks and the tax authorities has been lost, it is clear management issues,” Severin said.
He added that after the activity report is rejected by the meeting plenary, elections will follow for a new Board of Directors, and it will elect the director general of the institution.
I don't know who will be nominated for this position.
Miracles won't happen.
The important thing is to make political decisions for this institution to work.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, in the plenary of Parliament, by their vote will choose with great reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what is going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I do not know who will be, if you ask me what qualities they must have - good sense in the attitude towards employees because it is a bunch of petitions that come from employees, complaints, dismissals.
“When you get 50, 60, 70 referrals, something is rotten and we’re talking about the financial situation that is a disaster,” he said.
Although he did not appear at the Parliament, TVR President-General Stelian Tanase sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he requested that Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to saving and guaranteeing the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexing of the TV fee.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to the indexation of the TV fee, the amendment and completion of HG 978/2003 on the public television service fee, with a view to updating the provisions on up-to-date technological changes, as well as for the regulation of the control procedure in the field of TV fee payment and finding of contraventions and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision to extend the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv’s proxy for the collection of the TV fee, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission from receipts.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction of the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for the CNC from 15% to the 3% level, but also the amendment of Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budgetary/financial allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - World Football Championship, Golden Deer, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will be incapacitated in the following months considering that the labor legislation obliges the employer to enforce judgments, even if they are not final, and salary rights are honored as a priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce expenditure on TV staff and production.
"This has reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, renegotiated a series of commercial contracts, and at the end of July TVR News was closed," the letter reads.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only through his own efforts.
"Without the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will sooner or later be unable to carry out its public mission," the letter said.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Culture Committee.
The son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, sent to trial
Vasile Blaga’s son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to trial on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Prosecutor’s Office near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a file with damages of about 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL with his mother in April 2009, one year after he married Vasile Blaga’s daughter, Agathe.
The investigations showed that, in order to avoid paying taxes to the state budget, the representatives of a company specialized in the provision of security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been highlighted.
"In fact, in the company's accounting there would have been fictitious purchases of services, which, in reality, were not provided, thus damaging the state budget by about 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The Sheikhs determined the fate of Sanmartean
The Sheiks of the Al-Ittihad club have determined the fate of the middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that the separation of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, the manager of trainee Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will never happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the match title and does it well.
The Sheikhs also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave up on him.
There would have been another option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been several discussions, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has materialized," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted vice-president of the Court of Auditors
The plenary of Parliament on Wednesday voted on the appointment of PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, there were 290 votes "for" and 108 "against".
The vote was secret, with ballot papers.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 informs.
Moreover, the liberals criticized Sarbu’s appointment to this position and announced that they will challenge it to the CCR, provided that he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics.
The PSD senator will serve as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, which remained free after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is set to play the role of a chef in the movie "Burnt," the actor made a reveal that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: “I’ve worked a lot of my life as a chef.”
He revealed that he had worked in the kitchen since he was 15, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, he continued on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so his entire childhood cooked with his Italian grandmother, according to ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the kind of man to make five-year plans, "nor even two."
“It’s not at all motivating for me to have a map,” he said.
“I have dreams, things you would laugh at if I told you,” he said, but said that what he wanted from childhood had been fulfilled.
At the age of 40, the actor admitted that he sees himself directing in the near future, taking the role of Clint Eastwood, who also began directing at this age.
Ponta accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned on Wednesday morning the claims of the Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta that the political decisions in Hungary are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational claims, insults the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has totally lost his support in Romania's internal politics," the head of Hungarian diplomacy added, according to the MTI.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention to and sanction the behavior of high-ranking Hungarian government officials who, in his view, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives.
“This is a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and to anti-Semitic attitudes, and to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis,” Ponta said on Facebook.
The Romanian prime minister added that he is a supporter of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem – they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision makers no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees are fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction precisely with these objectives and values!"
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called the remarks of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis "merely a lie", saying the claims were inappropriate for a 21st-century leader.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday that the "extremist and lying remarks" of the Romanian prime minister are related to the internal political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest is waiting for excuses from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have always said and say is that I am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, as all those who come are terrorists, are Middle Age nonsense and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can receive more, we will receive, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with beating and inserting.
“I don’t agree with that,” the head of the Romanian executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government has decided to begin field preparations for the extension of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to erect a border fence would not solve any of the refugee problem and "take Hungary out of Europe".
The connection between Osama bin Laden and the crash of the crane in Mecca
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partly responsible" for the crash of a crane on Friday on the Great Mosque in Mecca, in which 107 people died.
According to an investigative commission, the company did not "comply with safety regulations," the Saudi news agency (SPA) reported.
The company’s directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden’s father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of the Great Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The crash occurred Friday night during a storm, when a crane, likely unbalanced by strong wind gusts, crashed on the eastern side of the roof of the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How he closed the mouths of the protesters
Considered by many to be the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled after his retirement as a weak coach who may not be able to perform in his new posture.
After an unfortunate experience at the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at Viitorul Constanta, the team he sponsors.
A year after taking over, the King has shown that he is capable of turning a team struggling to save from relegation into a top team.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 remises and 11 defeats.
The balance is one of a top team, which beats the European cups.
Things have taken an even better turn for the Future this season, as the team came in second place in the League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double that Star.
On the other hand, even though it brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and lately names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea appeared in the starting team.
The club's policy has made Viitorul a tracking team for foreign teams, so this summer Hagi sold 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Together with Steaua, Viitorul is the only profitable team in Liga 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It’s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can’t ask to be treated like the seventh country in the EU.
The big countries are coming up with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the board of directors of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come".
But there are masses that have started and we cannot turn history around.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best as possible and adapt them to us.
According to Cristian Ghinea, we are in an extremely emotional moment, in which politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the situation now."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA Council that, in fact, hasn’t solved anything?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All predictions said he would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applied in JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, is applied, and the Council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said there were votes.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it is a sensitive issue, there have been rejection reactions even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel’s opening policy and they did not want it to appear in many countries as a reaction like “EU sends migrants on our heads”.
So they put off, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governor and we will probably see big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas were not really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of the external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the boundaries of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be renounced, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece rolls over, you can't say it's Greece's business forever.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism for sharing the effort of reception?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they will be reached.
Because there remains a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don’t think the European states will take over the migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
There are likely to be single filtration centres in Greece or Turkey where asylum applications can be processed.
We are working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the migrant problem will increase the xenophobic current.
The truth is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have managed to leave, winter is hard to cross the Mediterranean, but we expect next year to a wave maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, we will not look at it as catastrophic from a media point of view.
Talk about countries with less or more experience.
Does it seem to you that there is any place where the integration of large groups from an extra-European culture has really succeeded?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go for radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
It has remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
But purely police means will not work.
Let's create fortress Europe and illusory.
The mechanisms of integration in European societies must be addressed.
There were some mistakes here.
We have to be more demanding.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take on the values, not to be left with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family, including through marriages of convenience.
But the impending problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, that doesn’t mean we have to watch them drown in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come.
And if there’s going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don’t think, it doesn’t mean that the country will be rebuilt overnight and you can take them back.
Before solutions emerge, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders were closed, walls were erected, border controls were reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in jeopardy?
The European project as such is not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where these migrants set foot for the first time.
I mean, we're free to move around, but everyone's got their own problems.
In the face of such a wave it can not be so, because some countries do not cope.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run it doesn’t change much.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we did last year.
It's a wave of public emotion settling in both directions.
And it’s so unstable from week to week that you can’t make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of warlike statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion is moving.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the European Single Market.
And I do not believe that Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, which thinks that if it pulls its hat over its eyes and closes its ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or to say that it is not your small country’s problem.
We have done this, it is a legitimate strategy, but after that you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh country in the EU.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanians’ appetite for Schengen will decline greatly.
President Iohannis says it's good that we haven't entered yet.
So we move from the desperation of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants see us as an alternative route.
This does not mean that there is a reason to stop entering Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become a common responsibility, there will be unique rules for accepting migrants, unique rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its attention to Syria to Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two foci, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power means confusing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
For about two years, it was a struggle between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State arose and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia was able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates foci of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you are a great power only if you have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to gain time.
Putin is probably waiting for offers to be made, to press the buttons to solve the situation.
Offers don’t come because the world isn’t convinced that he can somehow solve issues all created by him.
But I do not agree with theories that these people are ruled by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the “Like” button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another one, the “Dislike”.
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available soon, the New York Times informs on the blog.
Zuckerberg said the “Dislike” button would show a shade of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wants to avoid moments when someone posts to the account or an important event in their life, and someone else will “dislike.”
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long sought the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Zuckerberg said it was not comfortable for people to "like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or the death of a family member.
“You may not feel comfortable liking that post,” the Facebook representative said.
The version of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
“There is already enough hate on Facebook and on social media,” Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan said on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article on the subject was posted.
"I'm going to 'Dislike' the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, said there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it’s hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the “Dislike” button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands of them coming in droves at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the influx of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it would build a fence on its border with Romania.
The move drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Before the imposition of new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
Also, more than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The "new" seat of the County Council is about to fall.
Two builders in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, with a view to moving the institution, are falling apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The headquarters of the County Council in Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up falling apart by itself.
A year and a half after the construction and refurbishment of the building should have been completed, the work did not reach even half.
A final stage in the epic of the building was completed last days, when the National Council for Dispute Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract for the realization of the technical project for the works that are still to be executed.
The initial project was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company going to update the technical project, and then a new auction for the works is organized.
"The negotiations were not concluded by a contract, however, as CJ appreciated that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution," summarized R<0xC4><0x83>zvan Timofciuc, public relations representative at CJ.
The CJ’s decision to interrupt direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Iasi court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the CNSC decision to the Court of Appeal, only after a final judgment of the latter can be considered to find another designer.
Thus, the building consolidation work could be resumed at the earliest next year.
Our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Work on the consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Chess began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The auction was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
The works have been carried out so far in a proportion of about 50%.
Initially, the works of consolidation, refunctionalization and atticing of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
"Okay, I'm saying everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former chief of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the Cadastre Office signed an agreement to recognize the facts, against prison with postponement.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, led by former head Narciza Nedelcu
A counselor from the Office of Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) Iasi accused of DNA in a corruption file acknowledged his fav tele.
The agreement on the recognition of facts signed by Dumitru Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Tribunal, with the judges deciding to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was accused of intellectual forgery in continuous form and agreed to execute two years in jail with postponement, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to the facts imputed to Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu, the prosecutors specified that the SCRL was in charge of the services and that the SCRL was not in charge of the services, as the advisor of the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, "prepared in false several acceptance minutes, for the sale of the contracts of services previously keyed by the O.C.P.I. and Ia<0xC8><0x99>i S.S.
The previous days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of OCPI were sent to trial in this file, the accusations being the settlement of some services to the mentioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
Pre trial exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can only host a major handball competition in 2024, and preparing the women’s national handball team for the Olympic Games qualification costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for the Romanian women's national handball team, "the main objective is the qualification at the Olympic Games in Rio, but for this it has to pass two stages of caudine forks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu also said.
We are looking forward to qualifying for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a second coach, a doctor, two massors, a goalkeeper coach, a physical trainer, a chief of delegation.
They asked us for the qualification of some things, specifically materials for physical training, which we have never heard of.
These are all to get to the Olympics, and I'll do everything in my power to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
But that’s the way to perform.
Because at the moment we are in the stone age with preparation.
"The teams we fight with have these materials and they have them for some time," said Dedu, who said he is trying to get the necessary amounts for the purchase of these products from MTS and COSR.
The FRH President also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
There is no room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure issue and it is shameful to question a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let us not forget that in other corners of the world Olympic quarters have been built entirely in an interval of two years.
Before 1992, the current Olympic area of Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it has become a beauty landmark.
The same happened in London, where the organization of the 2012 Olympics was also a success in terms of investments.
“In my view, in 2024 we can host a major competition,” Dedu said.
He added that international handball organizations are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Ga<0xC8><0x9B>u went civilized with a project, the people gave their consent in principle, but it quickly became clear that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that they agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we talk concretely.
“So we have all the openness, both at the EHF and at the IHF, but we don’t have the infrastructure,” the FRH official explained.
The former great handball player avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucure<0xC8><0x99>ti and HCM Baia Mare reaching the Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in predictions, that if they do not meet they will turn against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players make their debut on September 23 against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said at a press conference on Tuesday that all members of the Romanian team are ready for the matches at the World Cup in England, where he hopes to win two victories: "We are ready".
Both I and my colleagues are with the engines at full speed.
We trained to give the best performance in all four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are heavy and ours are the same.
Let’s take it easy, first with France and then we’ll see.
But if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the crowning of so many years of work.
I do not want to disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romania national team coach Lynn Howells, who had his first experience as a World Cup coach, hopes to make the Romanians proud of the rugby national team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
For me it is an extraordinary experience.
It is very important for me to make the Romanians proud of the national team in every match.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitra<0xC8><0x99>, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made at the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romanian teams at the age of 18-19, so there is cohesion, it is a band of friends, who set out to achieve a dream," Dumitra<0xC8><0x99> said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will play in Group D, with the following matches scheduled: France on 23 September in London; Ireland on 27 September in London; Canada on 6 October in Leicester; Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition begins on Friday at Twickenham Stadium in London with the England-Fiji Group A match.

14 million lei given to "Sf. Spiridon" Hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i at the budget correction
What will be purchased with this large amount of money?
The Hospital "Sf. Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget correction, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit has received to use it by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and layout of some clinics, but also in medical equipment and technology for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new tomography computer, with a new radiology device, with six kits used for surgery, six beds of ATIs equipped appropriately, ophthalmological microscope and other devices necessary for the conduct of the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and layout works of the "Great Ars".
From the money from the budget correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section.
"In addition, in the coming days we will be receiving the works from the walkway that connects UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transportation of the patient from UPU to the neighboring clinics," explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have in the yard the Dermatology Clinic in Tatarasi, which will be organized in an outpatient clinic, in the same form in which it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where the allergy, hematology and endocrinology are located in the outpatient clinic and will have about 30 beds.
The Ia<0xC8><0x99>, made fun of by RATP controllers and a flyer.
A Tourist's Foolishness
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to walk in your town again.
Unintentionally, they were hit by the erroneous information in the leaflets, the insensitivity of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "as the law says".
The husbands arrived in Iasi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Center and asked for tourist brochures.
They also received a pamphlet in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the wives visited Ia<0xC8><0x99>.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to reach the Palas Mall.
Because there was no ton of tickets at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they could get a ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the flyer, they got on a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said there had been no service for two years and that it had been announced in the press that it had been cancelled.
How do I know what was written in the local press, when I came one night before visiting the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation to them, said they don't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all they could do was give us one fine instead of two (me and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day of visiting the gendarmerie stand and giving statements there!", Ovidiu says.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of erroneous information on the flyer and controllers who “applied the law to blood.”
It's not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about the money, I'm not overly many, but the point is, I felt wrong.
Bad luck for the ship's rapists.
They had an accident and were in pre-trial detention.
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui moved, yesterday, to the Iasi Court of Appeal.
The Iasi magistrates tried the first term in a non-public hearing in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Prior to the actual start of the court hearing, one of the judges from Iasi who had been assigned the file, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues at the court.
The magistrate worked until the summer of this year at the Tribunal of Vaslui, where he was the president of the Section Pe nale, he was the one who, on April 9, admitted a challenge made by four of the defendants, ordering their arrest at home.
At present, the case is being tried by a court that includes the magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Judge Dan An ton also filed an abstention in the case on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubinage relationship with one of the rapists’ lawyers.
The two judges decided that the rapists at Vaslui would remain in pre-trial detention.
They will remain in prison for at least another 30 days, when judges will re-discover the possibility of their release.
The next trial will be held at the Iasi Court of Appeal on October 6.
Before reaching the Iasi Court of Appeal, the van with which the rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the P<0xC4><0x83>curari neighborhood, the car entering Iasi on the belt.
The Iveco truck carrying the seven rapists hit a Volkswagen that had exited Canta road, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van runs from the end of the pacifier.
The car entered Ia<0xC8><0x99>i through here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on the stables, then on the belt road.
They shortened the road by a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the arrestees called another transport to take the prisoners.
Soon, a car was sent to the crash site from the Iasi Maximum Safety Penitentiary, which took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrestees were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the arrestees rushed out, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police, because the drivers of the cars agreed amicably on the damages to be paid," said Chief Commissioner M<0xC4><0x83>d<0xC4><0x83>lin <0xC8><0x9A><0xC4><0x83>ranu of the IPJ.
The Great Migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will come next.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and clearly: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize represent, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the Romanian state’s ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even accept to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely small.
They will be the first to lose their patience.
Paralyzed by underlings and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate Gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, make modern roads, kindergartens or schools, provide decent healthcare, collect the dirt on the street, create honorable paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what is particularly surprising is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
First, we are struck by the bellicose hypocrisy of the powerful states of the EU, which show the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably for fear of someone stealing their national being.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, do not accept any other destination of the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be laughed at.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, relying strictly on the book of political correctness, call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even from time to time, some foreign capital enters the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosed, divided and outdated construction.
I lamented that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but here the EU does not have any plans for the future.
Improvisations and threats don’t help.
Then, what good is the EU if the only advantage that Romanians enjoyed – the right to free movement – could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
Overpopulation, poverty, climate change, depletion of resources, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will follow.
7,000 euros per year to rent the Pogor Club.
The Destiny, Practically Imposed
The concession auction covers a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it remained closed, the club in the courtyard of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The building has a useful area of 134 sqm, on two levels of hrube.
CJ accepts as the destinations given to the building only those of literary cafe, bookshop or other activities with a cultural profile.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the starting value of the auction being 6,830 euros annually, with a tender step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to continuously and continuously operate the building and fully cover the costs of rehabilitating the building, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period in which the public food unit operated in these spaces and even after its evacuation, current repair and maintenance works were not carried out as they are currently necessary during the operation of a building," the documentation related to the tender procedure mentions.
Deals for the club are expected until 18 September.
Two brothers from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-olds, respectively 11-year-olds from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti, siblings, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was undergoing treatment, and the drugs were not hidden.
The children were taken urgently to the hospital "Saint Mary" in Iasi.
They are in stable condition, as the doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A date that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20 he received a courageous gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the dark of the 90s, when she had only two months to live, little, sickly and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family from Italy, in the same year in which adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman from Ile-de-France, now a blonde and beautiful girl, reunited with her parents.
Crina will be 20 years old these days, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought to give their beloved daughter a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, to know her unclear past.
The "Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Journal", which witnessed the efforts to search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
The reporters’ reports, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
Crina’s story begins 20 years ago in the town of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital, to the city.
At home, there began to be disagreements between the parents, and the mother was forced to leave the home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
He stopped the girl, and since then I didn't know anything.
“When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late,” Alina, the girl’s biological mother, recalls.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Pascani, and the girl’s father, Costic<0xC4><0x83> Balkan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives would be permanently separated.
They never found Crina in the hospital.
After the internment, Crina’s father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
“I thought she was abandoned,” says a granddaughter of the family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one has been interested in the fate of the child in all this time, it was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection of Iasi, which then gave it to the Care Center of Placement in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were loosely regulated compared to today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after a while she would move permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
“As if my wife had given him life,” Salvadore, the adoptive father, says smiling as he grabs the girl’s weak hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina’s parents, Alina and Costic<0xC4><0x83>, continued their search separately, each as far as they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where his child might be.
The police then told her that she may have died, but at Iasi her parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked her up here, they told me at the Tribunal that she's gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And I haven't had conditions to look for it.
We prayed to God to be well.
I’ve been thinking about it all the years that have passed, but there were no chances to walk, to find it.
“It’s hard,” Lily’s biological mother tells us with tears in her eyes.
However, even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and her wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
“I wanted to meet my parents in Romania,” Crina said.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March of this year, Romic<0xC4><0x83> Commissioner Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Iasi, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore’s desire to find Crina’s biological family.
And the search started with just a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I had only received one name, Coastal Balkan, then the locality, Ruginoasa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I was able to ask if there is a local name.
Then they gave me some indications, except that the person found was not the one I was looking for.
"It took about a month before we found the girl's biological father," Chief Commissioner Romanica Ichim explains.
In total, it took the authorities more than three months to find Costic<0xC4><0x83> and Alina, especially since they each had their domicile in another locality.
We started the process somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of the biological parents and the discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," Romica Ichim added.
Last weekend, Alina and Costic<0xC4><0x83> saw their lost daughter for the first time in the halls of the hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could barely control his tears, and his hands trembled unceasingly.
He barely exchanged a few words with those around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was still excited, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years, there is something," says a niece, who also came with Costic<0xC4><0x83> from Ruginoasa.
Crina's meeting with her biological mother and brother
In talks with his daughter, who is going to study at a high-ranking university in Italy, Costic<0xC4><0x83> Balkan told her, among other things, that if she wants to return to him, in the village, she can come quietly: she can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and make a house.
Her mother is also excited, crying, and hardly believes that this could happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think this could happen.
I’ve seen such cases on TV, I’ve been thinking all these years, I hoped, but I didn’t think I could be like that.
They are very high emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a connection," she tells us with tears on her cheeks as she holds a napkin.
In it she hides her tears, of happiness, because in a short time she will see her daughter after so much bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be in just a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn’t know what to expect, but she has sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has so much to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
After all, my parents are the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina tells us.
First family reunion in Iasi
In Union Square, under the autumn sky, the family from Ruginoasa unites their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing high school, after the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
It is no longer separating borders or countries, but only a barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Ia<0xC8><0x99>, passed easily.
Those who managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises again, they will do it again.
It’s the first event of this kind to be organized, with such an emotional load, and I’m happy to be a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who consume, people addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give society something good back.
"If I am asked for such an event, I will do it with great pleasure," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Iasi.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, walks away telling stories.
I understand: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with guns in hand yesterday at the PSD.
Everybody's pulling their soul
The camps in the Ile-de-France branch of the PSD concluded a truce with a gun on their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the executive chairman of the party, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing social democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for the positions of the party.
Far from being over, the party’s internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow the fighters to draw their soul.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He has launched a very simple and very current message in the conditions now: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussion over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing was certain.
In the October elections, fierce competition is expected for the position of president of the PSD county branch.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main office in the Iasi branch of the party are Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Laz<0xC4><0x83>r, county councilor Vasile Catea and the interim president of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
To these could be added the mayor of the village of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant considered is also the candidacy of the leader of the PSD county councilors, Cristian Stanciu, in case Lupu will no longer enter the race, sources within the party claiming that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former head of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day candidates can be submitted, and no one would be surprised if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all new leadership structures," said Quanta.
Until the internal elections are organized, the leadership of the PSD county branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until September 29, the preparation of the elections being practically provided by the executive secretary of the branch, the county councilor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions of the last days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is a wide willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variations on the intentions related to the candidacy for the presidency of the PSD Iasi, the list remains open," Stanciu commented.
A judge refused the case of the Vaslui rapists on the grounds of concubinage.
The seven young men in Vaslui county convicted of rape arrive today at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal.
Vasluians sentenced to five years to eight months and eight years to four months will present their arguments for their release today, after the substantive court, the Vaslui Court, ordered their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was handed down.
The file was registered with the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with magistrate Dan Anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton alleged that one of the defendants’ lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the highest punishment in this case.
How the Judges Motivated the Judgment
At the end of last week, the magistrate of the Vaslui Judiciary who sentenced the seven young people motivated the sentence.
In the motivation, the judge speaks of the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported him, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
"The court notes that after placing the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of liberty but not deprivation of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, a strong sense of indignation was felt at the level of the local and national community about the fact that people accused of serious acts are judged under a less restrictive measure."
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped was not a "church door".
“The court stresses that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, an aspect that the defendants wanted to highlight through their defenses, since a person’s physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext,” the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
Due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in the last decades can no longer continue in the following years.
Until Saturday, probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the UK Labour Party, many wonder to what extent the election of a politician who is not in a decision-making position after all can affect us.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of the post-war Labour movement.
Declared Marxist, anti-monarchist (he once asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a ferocious anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by Britain's "Russia Today" television channel), and of the renegade Hamas and terrorist movements.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is close to preferring the United States.
Following the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like the ones he was saying and promising and Tsipras in Greece until the moment he came to terms with the real world and the economic legacies.
The economic program of the new Labour leader foresees, among other things, massive renationalizations and the printing of money as a solution to finance development projects and to cover very generous social benefits.
Sure, some may wonder why the solution with the printing of money is not unanimously adopted on the globe, we would then have a global general prosperity!, but who else to avoid such details.
Of course, we can tax the bankers, who have become a kind of enemy of the left, to the blood, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterrand and Hollande.
The extra sums are quickly swallowed up by the generous, coverless promises made by populist demagogues.
Margaret Thatcher once said, “The problem with socialism is that at some point other people’s money runs out.”
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in his convictions as the new party leader, failed miserably in the election.
And then there was still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were significantly more influential than they are now.
Given the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant across the workforce, and extensive automation has made the industry massively in need of highly skilled labor, Corbyn’s rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In his latest issue of the Financial Times, he believes that Corbyn’s election increases the chances of Brexit and Britain’s exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis shaking from the EU’s foundations, you come to an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide following the referendum, which is due to take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the whole European project and the deep fault lines created within it by the Euro crisis and now that is why refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
Especially since for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin becomes more and more the dominant actor anyway).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates for the country’s stay in the EU.
But today’s Europe is no longer the one of the past.
There are many resentments, which increase in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, as we have recently seen in Jean Clude Junker's speech, increasingly tends to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this is happening at a time when electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration groups that are at the same time Eurosceptic is growing spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the negatively charged emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever before.
Which is why the Financial Times concludes when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If the voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn’s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will see a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the states in the region and to the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States fuel their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
Due to economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both provoked by hasty decisions that only took into account integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulences on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can greatly affect the situation of Romania.
And it’s hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a big dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
But behind his reputation lies something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
It also has a name.
It's called "trude."
What to write about Constantine Brancusi?
What else is there to say?
His figure appeared on the banknotes.
And recently, a well-known Romanian bank hired an actor to play it in an advertising clip.
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i has been producing and delivering money for almost 60 years since he was no longer with us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear its name.
In fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes out with the odrasla, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i".
The country is full of its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brancusi's ability to infiltrate is huge.
The Communists also failed to extirpate him from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes spread across the internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else would be to say, to write about this man?
Looking at the pile of books and articles trying to reconstruct his destiny, Brancusi’s life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you haven’t been lucky enough to be born in some big city and in a family as wealthy as you are, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Perhaps this is where the following text should begin.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Forget the silly success stories, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on TV.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he succeeded in life, how, today, he heard from a whole world map?
It's simple.
He's worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobi<0xC8><0x9B>a, a small village in the municipality of Pe<0xC8><0x99>ti<0xC8><0x99>ani, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
She is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i led a modest life, but one of which would collect the landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre <0xC8><0x9A>u<0xC8><0x9B>ea, from Paris, in 1933: "Back then life was beautiful and harmonious".
For thousands of years, people lived a happy patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from one season to the next.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
However, Brancusi’s childhood was far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor the years spent in the town of his birth.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brancu<0xC8><0x99>i. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when he was doing the boiler, watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going well, Brancusi catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills the palms of his hands with water and drinks breathlessly.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people notice it only after a few minutes.
My mother panics, then goes into hysteria, believing that her son has died.
In the evening, when his father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by lutes, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who wait for him with their soul to mouth.
The party immediately turns into mourning.
The father is already thinking about burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Br<0xC3><0xA2>nd<0xC5><0x9F>a, a dolphin and servant of the Br<0xC3><0xA2>nd<0xC5><0x9F>i.
The bride checks the baby’s breath, then puts the horse’s bum under her nose, gathered from around.
The child sneezes heavily.
The world applauds.
While the boy is left to sleep his drunkenness, of joy, the party with psaltery continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet in the orchard.
Radu Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i has Constantine gather some rods and bring them to him.
The father lays his child down and, with the nuts brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while feeling the sting of the blows, little Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i has the revelation that the world can be looked at from a different perspective and that things around him can appear to be turned upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit in old age, if the star itself did not participate in his disturbance.
Had the sun been as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?
At the moment, the city is not working.
A parliamentarian appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for him.
Independent deputy Viorel Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> called on the PSD and the PNL to stop the internal struggles and to reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political stage is a great division and that’s all.
I haven’t seen anything from the USL projects since 2012 to continue.
Neither highway, nor Regional Emergency Hospital, just see how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let’s put politics aside, come together and talk.
At the moment, the city is not working.
“If you’re busy with the internal war, you don’t have time for those who chose you,” Bl<0xC4><0x83>jut said.
He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i electorate, the consequence being a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around the figure of 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
He also believes that the voters will also focus on the traditional parties, expressing their reservation to new political initiatives, such as the party "For Ia<0xC8><0x99>i" that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break from the right-wing electorate, not from the PSD electorate.
Such parties rely on civic active people, who are usually right-wing.
"The right is crumbling even more, which is not good for anyone, not even for the PSD," Bl<0xC4><0x83>jut said.
He said he was not interested in a candidate in the upcoming local elections, denying rumors of his intention to enter the race for the City Hall.
I said I don’t want to run for office.
I’m still thinking about whether to continue as a member of Parliament in the future.
I tried to appeal to unity for Iasi and in the discussions in the halls, with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to make an image.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it does not mean that they are stupid to vote for us if they do not see anything," said Blajut, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
A colleague from Tatarsi said that he does not have enough money and he has to go by bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There's not a little money.
Sometimes I'm embarrassed to pick up money from the cashier.
At the end of the mandate I will report on everything I have spent, except the salaries of the employees in the office and its maintenance.
I happened to raise 30,000 lei in a month, with all the transport, accommodation and other accounts.
"To say that the money is not enough is pure hypocrisy," Bl<0xC4><0x83>jut concluded.
