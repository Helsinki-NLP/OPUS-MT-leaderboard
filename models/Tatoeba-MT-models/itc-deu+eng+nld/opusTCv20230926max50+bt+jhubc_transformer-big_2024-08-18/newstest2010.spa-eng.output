Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will receive them, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, visit the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee that, in October, chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple are scheduled to meet with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, although he will be the third to receive it in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and cheque of 10 million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million Czech kronor).
It is proposed to donate them for charitable purposes, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During his full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended by, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the award.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he doesn’t deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action."
Nature Advocate Accused of Blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the Spole<0xC4><0x8D>nost ochr<0xC3><0xA1>nc<0xC5><0xAF> p<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>rody Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice (Society of Nature Defenders) of blackmail.
Last year she appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals demanded from investors money for their own benefit, said Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Nature Defenders Society is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently detained and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn’t like containers too much to separate garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate the packaging of drinks and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno the garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle in the center to the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially it requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> Square, opposite the Potrefen<0xC3><0xA1> Huse.
Let not Mr. Onderka and his companions be angry with me, but that seems too little to me.
It is not necessary to mention that in other places it is not easy to separate the garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
For vagrancy
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several bottles of glass and plastic.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the trash was already overflowing from the container.
It is still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city the extra league of hockey, which shames us throughout the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other matters so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is truly the worst in the entire Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj region.
The budget of "Paroubek" took money from incomes and sickness subsidies
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt all those who govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they trusted that the government would later borrow for sensitive expenses, rents or sickness subsidies. "That only means postponing the problems for the future, it's laying mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest rates and, one day, you have to return the money.
The state doesn’t have many options to make money.
If you don’t reduce social benefits or government operating expenses, you have to raise taxes.
To everyone you added the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, his children as well.
People don't have to worry about incomes or health benefits, they'll get them.
But the price to pay will be the increase in the public debt; next year there will be not only 163 billion missing in the treasury, but more.
Despite Janota’s efforts, debt will continue to rise alongside interest expense.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion missing to finish the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already taken place and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and whose price cannot be reduced.
The most that can be done is to keep them, which is also not free.
That means delay or cessation of the 30 large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the decrease in funds: it will get money from the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which is mostly owned by the state, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year <0xC4><0x8C>EZ allocated to the budget 18 billion.
Each year the dividends are paid for ecological damage, serve to complete the account for rents or serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of rents.
Moreover, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to award various compensations to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need these funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Afterwards, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, take advantage of the reserve of the government budget.
There is also a lack of $100 million for the Statn<0xC3><0xAD> pokladna (State Bank) project, which costs $2 billion and has already been started, and which should allow the authorities to monitor online what they are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, at the touch of a button, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
At the touch of a button, they switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They will be able to switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a RAM of 128 MB, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware is cooperating with European and U.S. carriers to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only ski lift operators in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e are concerned about snowless slopes.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at deals, check prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, if this Christmas there will be snow or mud," mentioned the maintainer of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n according to their expectations, should not hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n mainly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us the most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered remain free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some last-minute holiday breaks,” Ingtours director Petr Schiefert said.
The Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e as well, but there are fewer open spaces.
They sell very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is harmed by the lack of snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will run out too,” says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year’s Eve stays are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central car park in Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are at approximately sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, at the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will spend their time waiting for snow.
Temperatures should fall on Thursday and, if there is rain, it should snow in the mountains.
But then temperatures will rise again, reported Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only does the same text use the phrase “like in Iraq” several times, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush’s January 2007 statement for his own statement: “A New Way Forward.”
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only one possible and successful, so that today there is no talk of Iraq in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, yet objectively he left his successor in a much more favorable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even despite the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but came up with nothing better, so he at least misled the general over 10,000 military.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his goal, to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders abide by the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is kept.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. After him will remain the patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relationships, further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is “capable of action,” a minimal goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy is shattered by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to “soon return home” will perform some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what the relationship between the security of Germany or Italy and the war with the Hindu Kush is.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions exert no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election and that is why there is still a long time to find another strategy, if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank Executives Will Not Receive Cash Bonuses Again
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, shares may be withdrawn if they have assumed excessive risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it must take, said former JPMorgan investor Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after it set aside nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of bonuses at the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, 20 billion dollars.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax in one go, with a 50 percent tax, bonuses for banks exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics
Five women, a record number, received this year’s Nobel Prizes in specialized categories and literature in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden.
In addition to the four female scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was also among the winners.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each winner collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish kroner (approximately 25 million Czech kroner).
If there are several winners in each category, the prize is shared among them.
The most traditionally awaited Nobel Peace Prize winner was received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will receive on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps Janota’s stay in the cabinet, is supposed to be the subjects of his meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
President Radim Ochvat's spokesman said.
Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The House of Representatives, however, on Wednesday approved left-wing proposals for fund transfers and increased money for civil servants’ salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious internal policy conflict. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the SDGs, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics say the budget, in the version approved by the House of Representatives, de facto liquidates the package of cost-saving measures imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can rely on a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
SDG leader Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
SDG Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, SDGs and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences".
The head of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek, reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
On Wednesday <0xC4><0x8C>SSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were happy too.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, starring Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said 91-year-old Mandela asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama about the boxing world of Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the slave-ending movement for the abolition of slavery, the fictitious president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite rugby players, who belong globally to the outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story into theaters.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela’s hand.
I found that by shaking your hand, I received your energy, it was transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the rugby world.
A big surprise for him was when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, “In the movie I look much taller.”
Despite the obvious differences between the actors' characters and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talked about ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
Russia’s defense ministry said it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the border with Norway.
The missile, of the "Bulava" type, formerly intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulav<0xC3><0xA1>, in most cases, did not fly or there was an air failure.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there were no problems at first.
At the end of the flight, there were again technical problems with the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a boat that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That’s why it’s likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed “Bulava.”
The Norwegians did not hesitate from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by stating that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile withstood and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines were immediately broken in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the Ministry of Defense management only six of the thirteen failed.
The success of almost fifty percent filled with optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to claim that "Bulava" one day will fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose total maximum weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will once again appear at the age of 51 in a professional hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov ended his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practices constantly and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to settle some formal issues, the AP quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
"I think Fetisov is one of those who manages to lift the spirits of the other players," Nemchinov said.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest-serving professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, for the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canadian Cup and in the junior world championship.
In the second half of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing for Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Glory.
Hyundai has met the requirements of the unions. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the automobile factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent supplementary work, the unions declared on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions on another Saturday shift.
We cannot resign ourselves to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will work in two shifts, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
According to the server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working the shift on Saturday.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company decided to change the way it motivates its employees with the extra work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or can take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend the Christmas holidays by one day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shifts will receive money for the trip and for food.
Because supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all supplementary work for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k mentioned.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted practically every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the emergency strike.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists is due to take place on Monday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they pledged to meet the requirements and signed the document, they were willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent supplemental work.
They also protested against poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
Management said employees had to work overtime to meet requirements and be able to supply the cars.
Trade unionists in their strike emergency statement on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, the trade unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial production began last November.
As of last September, it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech Discovery: An Effective Substance Even in 'Stretched' HIV Viruses
Czech and German scientists test new compounds to moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some already available drugs.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarboranes have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all the drugs used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus’s albumin.
Metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages composed of the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, HIV virus fractionation does not occur and mature, infectious HIV corpuscles would not be created.
If we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was performed in a test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarboranes on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metallocarborans interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Genetics.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDG chief Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said the approved budget for next year is "awesome" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, he said, think about its future existence.
The SDG statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say time is left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, which tries to fight the growing deficit, or if he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amending proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the SDG proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The SDGs before the vote came out of the room and so fulfilled the government’s wish, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign if the amending proposals were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> televise Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He said he was thinking about staying in the role.
The reason is their disillusionment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees to another fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as in the government have nothing to do with the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD nominees, who imposed the budget changes.
The prime minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, if the chamber passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those that refer to subsidies in sickness, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers nominated for the SDG are not to blame
It is the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers nominated for the SDGs have done nothing wrong, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the public finance deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, to lean on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I have not thought about it, when the time comes, I will take care of it, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies Defense Minister Martin Bartak, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of the SDGs.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
SDGs conceded at the Prime Minister's request
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that the SDGs in the House of Representatives on Wednesday would likely vote against the amended budget if the prime minister did not explicitly ask SDG MPs to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he reacted to the question, if the SDG does not worry about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from the mandate, he knew that in the following months it would be mainly about the bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of all the positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek himself reacted.
According to the new train schedule of <0xC4><0x8C>D will run fewer trains for almost the same rates
<0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy (Czech Railways) from December 13 will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total extent of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into effect.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostrava, drahy for this line will add a pendolino road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not run again in Bratislava.
On the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line there will be fewer fast trains, direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by drahy is in the Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the route Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and some fast trains on the line Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice will also be cancelled and will be reduced to a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance links to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will run every two hours.
From December 13, travelers will not travel to Bratislava again in Pendolino.
This year’s account for regional railways: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive four billion crowns in total next year, as this year. The local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast trains and local drahy have a new ten-year contract, until now the contract was always one year.
Dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why they did not increase the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will only occur on one-day tickets - <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and on cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travelers without a customer card, the <0xC4><0x8C>D Net price will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance, so far there was the single price of 160 crowns for trips between any two regional cities.
Philippine Armed Forces Continue to Detain More Than 50 People, Children Released
The armed groups have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including several elementary school pupils and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only about 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children arrested and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 armed men are said to use the hostages as a living shield in their escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to hand over the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, police previously persecuted the kidnappers because of violence, the cause of which was the settling of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in Maguindanao province it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor’s election, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre they arrested the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA’s story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official title in Czech is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), which captures part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela, is released in American theaters.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the lead role.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of the critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
At the same time, the media are shuddered by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, to – as they say – recharge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the movie we can remember the character and message of Mandela.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the costume of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also stars in the South African national rugby team suit and enters the field of play. RSA won the world cup back then.
For entering the gramilla in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of white inhabitants.
The football championship may succeed in helping people unite and form a nation, mentioned rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany, said in a recent LN interview.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of kroner burns in Lounsko
The fire grabbed a transformer from the <0xC4><0x8C>eps company in a switch box near the village of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsko in the morning.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, however later they changed their mind and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>, the company’s spokeswoman, the breakdown does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire goes out.
According to Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of <0xC4><0x8C>eps’ activity nothing similar happened, the breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerov<0xC3><0xA1> Hendrychov<0xC3><0xA1>, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s spokeswoman for the northern Czech Republic, electricity supplies were not cut off, and the fire at the power substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps p<0xC5><0xAF>sob<0xC3><0xAD> on the territory of the Czech Republic as sole maintainer of the distribution system, of the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical conduction.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical power from the transmission system to the distribution system, in addition to maintaining the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a complaint for slander to three Hetmans of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Student Agency owner Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today will file a complaint for slander against three social democratic Hetmans.
It is Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj region, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nek from Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> kraj and the Olomouck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj Hetman Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
The demand has to do with the company's effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the raisins from the cake", yet we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy, which is not true. We know the prices of <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander against the Student Agency society, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
He mentioned at the same time having the tests of all the regions. According to him they have not taken necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers this complaint for the continuation of the media show of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose, and it will be clearly shown again on this occasion, that Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is manipulating the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and is using false and lying arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that it would invest several million kronor in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started the campaign after the regions agreed with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy on maintaining regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion kroner did not call a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura claims to have been threatened by a <0xC4><0x8C>SSD deputy, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't let him, we could lose bus licenses.
He presented himself as a <0xC4><0x8C>SSD member, I know, which gentleman he is talking about, I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l today.
Pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are culminating.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccinations for children born in August
Beginning in January, children born on or after August 2 of last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age of a child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily allowed their children to be vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450,000 crowns annually on vaccines.
Clutch will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state has spent on all vaccination of children about 500,000 annually.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and sepsis.
Pneumococcal infections in our country each year die according to research in hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, pneumococcal vaccine coverage in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccine may be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, said for example Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Their association has been propagating pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It is not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to be able to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this time we do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborn<0xC3><0xA1> spole<0xC4><0x8D>nost praktikk<0xC3><0xBD>ch d<0xC4><0x9B>tsk<0xC3><0xBD>ch léka<0xC5><0x99><0xC5><0xAF> Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> recognizes that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
“In the situation, when the vaccine costs so much, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a voluntary one,” Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> says.
Experts expect that as of next year, more than 80 percent of young parents will allow their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococci.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by the health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, then save on treatment, Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "take money out of health insurance."
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid for by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The son of an American artist involved in "theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught carrying 90 frames in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of such characters as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
The AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52, told police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta Sr. denied granting such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increases in Budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, against criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Finance Minister also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements as of 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished by a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems.”
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which says this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE REPORT PREVIOUS TO THE BUDGET
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, as of April 2011
The economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonds
The increase of 1 point of the corporate tax for small firms was discarded
Tax breaks for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit for 2013 involved "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and spending cuts outlined were a "sand grain in the desert" compared to what was needed.
“These are big figures, it will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party’s forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence how much to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be reduced, have been called into question after the Finance Minister was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, far worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while borrowing order would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion above previously estimated.
"Opportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party’s “debt crisis,” said the <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion loan application projection for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, “cynically” dodging difficult options until after the June 2010 elections.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and have wasted it."
“All important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals that would seek further deficit reduction in the short term.
But Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised from tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sandcastles.”
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said the timing of the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to allegations of electoral maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing the people most in need and will review the situation in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not release post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the finance minister’s figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“This is really putting off the pain for later,” said director Robert Chote.
“All important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins,” added Roger Bootle, economics consultant for Deloitte’s accountants.
"This has been the false report prior to the budget. Markets realize this."
FBI Investigates 'American Detentions in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in Virginia last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are reportedly of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
“If they are U.S. citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been detained and in what kind of circumstances they are being held,” spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing,” the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already in the sights of local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the U.S. had to “work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people.”
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian “abuse”
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details the regime’s “models of abuse” before and after the June presidential election.
One man cited in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticism has a political foundation.
The thousands arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been sentenced, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, as saying he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election result.
"I'm often hit in the face" according to his words.
“They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, in my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted there had been abuse.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who said he and 75 others were held in a container for more than eight weeks at a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the discomfort of the post-selection and government response, but said the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee’s inquiries had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the runway, but that it was quite frightening.
You can see below a beautiful view of the city lights tickling.
Here are some of the county’s best skiers and snowboarders, true talent.”
The prizes were awarded to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France’s 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students on the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation seeks to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not able to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr Bowen interviews tend to disagree with their Salafi counterparts, supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives “an adjustment of values.”
After reading this book, one tends to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The most desolate panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that can’t survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transportation and fishing have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a consequence of this.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave valuable evidence in the face of the white bear.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, it exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth of the area of a wild adult's scope. The climate is almost never adequate: a Singapore-based polar bear turned green by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on accounts from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Eskimo Indians on snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to take down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a startling look at how the future of the Arctic can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It is not for lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering travels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then Cold War submarines mapped the fast-moving ice cords that circulate beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but resilient individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by jets of saline water that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice retreats, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington graves
De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are being shipped, these could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place crowns on veterans’ graves in various sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey each year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and at the commemorative site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late military career.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older tombs from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War because they don’t get as many visitors as the new tombs, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands, as they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red loop tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud names carved into the stones, while others leaned over to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped the tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone to remember it."
Cuban Officials Arrest U.S. Government Contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything that is considered “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a fledgling blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor could likely spark tensions between the Castro brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow-paced" rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for text messages, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available at expensive hotels and for foreign hotel visitors, and at some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing mobile phones for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "Nuevo Castro, same Cuba", a reference to Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro's position as leader of the country, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often detained, prosecuted and jailed in one day.
He said any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani Officials Unravel Plot to Send Men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who scour the Internet for radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity because of the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men were not immutable and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps when Pakistani law enforcement authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underscores the recruiters’ critical role in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who they trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people inside al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting go of those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said al-Qaida is paying special attention to aspiring U.S. recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge appeal, due to their potential to gain access to U.S. targets and due to their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they admit to, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate "action"
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here through the streets demanding from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center, bolder actions for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that read “There is no Planet B” and one in Spanish that declared, “Earth says “enough is enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said her mother’s native Peru trips made me aware of the distressing issues the country must deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, these activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists in sports masks and black attire placed several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started out as flares, but were followed by “a couple of big explosions.”
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
Asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “I really wasn’t aware of the situation.”
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each one to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence from a test reveals persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal gradebook on math performance was very good news for the Capital District’s public schools.
Although the District is still far from the best performing systems in the country, the gradebook showed fourth- and eighth-graders stepped at a faster pace over the past two years, relative to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of D.C. white fourth graders over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the yield gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth-grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year span, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first ENPE was unveiled in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the gap has only narrowed to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the ensemble by catering to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I’m not jumping for joy by a two- or three-point difference, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Elementary Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message from the test scores is that the city’s high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what worries us is that we are not devoting the time and energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue finding better ways to address the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at elementary and middle school seniors who did not master the fundamentals of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics, a math curriculum from kindergarten through sixth grade that emphasizes games and real-life experiences, was introduced to the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for underperforming schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here’s a kind of rugged dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element in ending the performance gap is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to get the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers’ union last year in a year of 185 days, which she sees as an “indicator” to seek a bigger increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more future
The tour bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a loud bang.
Graciela Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, 12 years old, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic prospective students.
Graciela, who would like to study medicine, exclaimed when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Man, really?, he said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the low teacher-student ratio of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh the children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question isn’t whether you’re going to go to college.
The question is to which.
While there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in their teens, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” Hispanics graduate from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze the highest performers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to fix it, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to run college preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue through high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to lure major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a leading role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, maimed by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away having bid on only two of the 10 sites auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only person who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached deals for sites auctioned in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants at the opening of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday and political instability as the U.S. military withdraws, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from taking more aggressive risks in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have tightened ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese state-owned National Petroleum Corporation offered more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major oil fields.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological power, oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments to Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit proposals made bids that they then confronted with the barrel subsidy the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each field.
Al Qaeda’s top planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile strike on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have died Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified plane, of the type operated by the CIA within Pakistan’s illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, an official with Pakistan’s civilian intelligence agency said, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the “totally shattered bodies.”
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military planner, who led the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
It was dedicated to conspiring around the world, said a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had strategic guidance from al Qaeda’s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not diminish in any way the threat he posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led unmanned aircraft attacks has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count by The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit organization.
The decrease is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
The top UN envoy in Kabul on the verge of resigning
U.N. top envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said Friday he would resign in March, ending a tumultuous term that was hampered by allegations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but was concerned that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule starting in 18 months would prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials to collaborate with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that they better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun searching for a replacement, according to U.N. officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said the accusations of Galbraith, who was fired, "surely harmed the mission, because there was already much skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also boosted the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, which lend themselves to the Afghan mission, saying this would increase their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the UN’s cumbersome hiring regulations undermined his ability to attract talent.
Such is how UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran to face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population at large.
He argued that it would take “a package of incentives and disincentives,” “to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons,” because “their people will suffer greatly” from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program does not fully comply with U.N. Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, he said he would renegotiate on restricting his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of his enriched uranium stockpile in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from tentative deals, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to commit to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran’s tightening up with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way that they haven’t in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before rethinking other options, including continuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday "unfounded and baseless accusations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was returning to Washington on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to diminish the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them.”
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that sermonized them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city’s low birth rate and aging population, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only to one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously chubby children, spoiled only children, affectionately dubbed “little emperors,” a demographic crisis is brewing in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
The UN demographic, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Family Planning and Population Commission, said fertile couples should have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate a future labor shortage.”
Shanghai is about to be “as old (not so rich, though) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden,” he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate ever introduced by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labor discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they softened many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Demographic Research Institute, said central government officials have recently been discussing even more sweeping changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incentivize more births.
Almost overnight, posters ordering families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples at their homes and slide brochures under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child after the campaign's launch, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to only reach about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Caolu municipality in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants an only child because she too was: “We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we don’t really want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more bluntly.
For middle-class, two-career parents who cut the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents’ struggle during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, “they have to remodel their apartment,” and the strategic “they have to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycares when the child is 9 months old.”
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, hitherto characterized by defiant stances and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying the bulk of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give the poor to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what the limit would be of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what top UN climate official Yvo de B<0xC3><0xB3>er described as “the big picture.”
It shows the profiles for a possible deal, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would cut theirs during the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the conversations last week were presented on Friday.
U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense,” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing off on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the world’s twenty-four most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the boldest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it was not surprising that major powers were discussing who should pay the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive seeking to contain the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional advisor on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say the talks will produce at most a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most exceptional issues before heads of government come to a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and rushed to the Bella Center corridors, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delineate the claims to be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists who play the guitar present night shows mocking the countries they say are selling, and they pass preliminary proposals hand in hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, vice president for global Conservation International policy.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain’s first 225 km/h train redefines Monday’s sentiment
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high-speed intercity train in the country will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and switching planes and cars to the railroad would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still slow Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
“It looks like this will be the most beneficial option,” said one railroad member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour now.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support trains of 400 meters in length, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the space constraints of the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if it starts the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
Trains would initially be forced to leave the high-speed lines on existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change from planes to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers Face Mortgage for a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orange from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange grove he built in his constituency home.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived on “rations,” increased his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-framed extension at his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said the requests "could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Houses nearby have sold for nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange tree".
Neighbors described it as “a greenhouse for entertainment.”
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase during a recent House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee inquiry into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal collateral for a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 from his London property to his constituency home, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before he became a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately 1,400 pounds a month in mortgage interest, through March of last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would fund the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The BRE’s standard variable mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, the rate at which it is now.
The most recent document issued by House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan was still claiming <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as House opposition chairman in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive “rations” after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live off rations and be treated like shit."
He said: “I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t.”
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the wage office that this “could be considered excessive.”
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the pound sterling symbol on Mr. Duncan’s lawn as a protest, after it was revealed that he had requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, “It was for primordial improvements, approved both by the wage office and later by Legg.”
He added: “It’s not about circumventing and offending or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn’t be any clearer or simpler.”
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the advent of the palapa of Brighton beach
Brighton palapas have found a new boost for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests being able to watch the last palapa from 5.30pm to 6.30pm every day, with stuffed cakes and punch served for free.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid cleric from the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I believe the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the Palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner party.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to prove and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested on Saturday demanding an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police detained several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, paraded through the icy Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Climate Change Conference is expected to reach by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization for climate around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke shop windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "indiscriminately", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized in the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with sky-high raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to Friends of the Earth’s call to form “blue tides” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take to the streets to seek compensation for ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot keep saying: there is time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that are drying up, streams of water through which you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which gathers many islands very vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red and wearing handkerchiefs with solar-powered slogans.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of demonstrators were formed who claimed to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president on Saturday; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 by control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to the officials of the Electoral Commission of Abkhazia, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five running candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of balloting.
This election is a farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," his spokesman Manana Manjgaladzé said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After her separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand dead, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP.
She was among the voters who walked to the polling station at a school in the capital, Sukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: “We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and particularly the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, responded by lifting his glass of vodka.
Meanwhile, the opposition represented in the election by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes control of the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, maintains that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus a vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: protests in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets around the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that is to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke shop windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
Police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near a busy house during incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to police.
We did not take our eyes off the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with sky-high raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to Friends of the Earth’s call to form “blue tides” for “justice and climate.”

Oxfam, along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which gathers many islands very vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated dressed in red and wearing handkerchiefs with solar energy slogans in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed claiming to act against climate change.

The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be broadcast in the Informative of Sunday (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all first-grade students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be sub-branches of the C, he goes on to underline: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged that they had eliminated history and geography second to high school in technological schools."
An IFOP poll published Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven out of ten French (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in second grade C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that “there is no talk” of eliminating philosophy from the second-grade C program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) convened a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
In addition, they will do internships in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as trainee teachers.
If you do all the internships proposed before the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Escuela Normal Superior, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, opened the “Ernest” conference conference, a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and convey to them the desire to know more, explained during the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that “the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record.”
The videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school’s website starting Dec. 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: Disgust among prison guards, action is planned
Prison guard unions on Friday called for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the holiday season, bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers’ Force (2nd Guards Union) asked off-duty personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “block them” to denounce the theft of their assets.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", as it calls the non-payment in December of the "overtime, nightly premiums, Sundays and public holidays" worked in October "shameful and unacceptable".
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (UFAP/UNSA), "calls for the general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury".
The Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased greatly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Foreign Ministry reported that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a misappraisal of the number of overtime hours does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous function and objective bonuses, and who "always blame the budgetary demands", deplored Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, the FO interregional union in Marseille said indignantly, announcing its decision to boycott "all meetings and convenings" until further notice.
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding public holidays if those of the month of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increasing without taking more troops, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of staff, estimates the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, not all regions are the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But in any case, the result is not as expected, UFAP Secretary General Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget said.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Makes "Better Gifts" Than He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous TV presenter, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion regarding gifts: "I make better gifts than the ones I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will air on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holiday season at their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s little four-legged companion, will be on the sidelines.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will “of course” receive a gift, according to the show’s extracts broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: “No way, last year I gave you nice gifts,” she said teasing the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before responding humorously pointing to the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you that?”
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a bicycle with two speeds, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture in line against the wall, instead of accommodating it around the home, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims to be in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was reinstated in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims that the singer underwent an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-intervened Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "injuries resulting from the operation" of a herniated disc performed in Paris on November 26, his press service in the same city said, indicating that these injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey peace of mind by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more certain about their condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that “according to some sources” no cannulas would have been introduced to it after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection resulting from Delajoux's intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad time," but said it was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter."
He called me just before he traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was foolish to fly twelve hours after such an operation, it is not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, intended to reassure by claiming that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had conversed with Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was admitted for nine days following a crash on his yacht.
Two months later, to his general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on from a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is over-reported. Fans and journalists noticed the musician's difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title in his favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist in the Worlds-2009 long pool, won on Thursday an international title in a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimsuits were last allowed, only three world records were broken when in reality many more were expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m freestyle, a mark he owns in long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a first at international level.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world record (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that will be banned from January 1.
These swimmers, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of the swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower his mark in 400 m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give up on this race.
I knew this time I wasn’t going to be able to break a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: A sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, the Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel, 2 meters long and 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century A.D., and its price had been estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is a rare piece, since in the world there are only four or five," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bid by buyers, without a doubt, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition by Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her private Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico said conditions were not in place to transfer to its territory the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied safe conduct.
At the moment, after a phone conversation with President Zelaya at night, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
To grant him a safe-conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "renounce" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a guest head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign my post ..., they wanted me to present my resignation," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been five months in the country of Central America.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, refugee in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with the Caracas-based Telesur network.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya’s departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president on Wednesday, who gathered around the heavily besieged Brazilian embassy.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
That reflects the marginal character of this government against international norms, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the Justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Fuels Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Thursday, the U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the definitive figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, a technological component, 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-filled glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused primarily on U.S. trade balance figures, “which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent from September to $32.9 billion in October.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, in particular goods exports, which reflect the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power boo at the "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted in the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, said an AFP journalist.
Let the Yankees die!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l!" shouted the militants of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "protect" them.
The day before, a similar demonstration was unleashed against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day, were arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, an AFP journalist reported.
Agents forced dissidents into the vehicles who were booed by government supporters, the reporter said.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "White Ladies", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "apply for the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is one of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities call opponents “mercenaries” or “agents” for the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Made very rare in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of government militants against the "counterrevolutionaries".
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the centre of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne on Thursday at the peak of the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have hit with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an old man, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No 85 of boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, police sources and witnesses reported.
In the wake of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to an official of the Alliance police union.
Later in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, stepped in and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the elderly man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman fainted and was interned “in shock,” a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped through the boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
Apparently by chance, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a man of thirty, and another of forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he had crossed on his back, explained on the spot a leader of the Alliance union in the Hautes-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to control the alienated, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn’t make it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a bartender at a nearby bar.
A crowd was thrown at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
By the boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were wounded with punches, according to the testimonies of the police.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was a wounded man in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. Putting him in a safe position, I noticed a very large wound in the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person arrived, about 35 years old, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Prosecutor ' s Office of Nanterre submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of him being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to master him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "everybody of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of the action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for dismissal of case
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, be dismissed in a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, an attorney for the director of "The Pianist," filed a grievous procedural error complaint with three judges of the California Second District Chamber of Appeals in 1977.
Hummel stated: I demand that the charges be dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who has since passed away) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before handing down a sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But in late September, Wells said he "lied" to the documentary's author.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, namely that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old.
Since then, he has never set foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "has to be here to appear at the hearing."
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing?
For her, the filmmaker “asks the court for a favor, even though he despises its authority.”
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce their sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She argues that her client can no longer stand to be harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: "No one in this room can say the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his hut in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down due to dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed aimlessly on Friday, in a market that is debating between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the definitive figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technology component, lost 0.55 points to stand at 2,190.31.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of trade is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped to improve market opinion as to the soundness of the economic recovery,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence rebounded visibly in December, 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were held back by a further rise in the dollar, which reached the highest level in two months against the euro, which “leads down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492 % the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title are on the final stretch to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second year in a row around Johannesburg, five of them already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Sportsperson or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I have seen so many things and lived countless experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone astonished.
This contest, which is held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 pm (15 pm GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very glad to have lived twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "breathtaking African landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the candidates for Miss World focus on the contest.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, swimsuits.
Chinese host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa has proven to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that are hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World contest.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional event, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd get to know.
She will probably be back for the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his father in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told reporters as he got off the plane that was bringing him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The son of the singer, relaxed, said he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday due to an infection derived from the herniated disc operation last November 26 in Paris.
The musician has been "in an induced coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday due to an infection, a sequel to a herniated disc operation last November 26 in Paris.
The singer was once again operated on the night of Wednesday through Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer last November 26 at the international private clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus claimed that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly with the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated on twice with a herniated disc, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he said the singer had reportedly "left without a cannula, without anything", following his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a bruise formed as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the court on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, went into a hiatus.
Undoubtedly, to resume the tour on January 8th (in Amiens, n.d.l.r.) as planned, I find it very risky, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the acronym of the former Giscardista party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, on pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, as he considers that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having reached out to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of its management, he received the help of Deputy Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the rights to the trademark to them, under penalty of a lawsuit.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the movement's name, the "New Centre", and the slogan "the UDF of today" in their militant material and on the homepage of their site, the letter's signatories say.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office which requires that the NC remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from all support, as well as from (its) website".
It also calls on Hervé de Charette “to transfer ownership of the trademark to the rightful owners.”
Failure to do so will result in an appeal to the courts to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they specify that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Center has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the mark", he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
Take advantage of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF in a scandalous and fraudulent way to do it on your own.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they denounce, before mocking the strategy of the NC: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you do not have a right."
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to put the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier on trial to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the 80-year-old to rob her of a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter compete for the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to submit to such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday must submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating whether and during which periods Liliane Bettencourt suffered states of weakness.
I think he'll take it.
“I’m going to talk to her,” said Mrs. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, as he left the hearing.
For his part, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed criminal charges against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a multi-faceted photographer and artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of his mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the provenance of the action brought by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ allegations turned out, on some occasions, to be a great family confession.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters that her client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said that she was suspicious of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to talk to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise again.”
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to give rise to her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear in court, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place," said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, the public prosecutor's representative.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers once the trial had taken place.
A management revolution or the end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to their employees recalls the position of companies with respect to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to "values" determined from above as before it was about imposing on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to strategies for conquering markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no relation to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
An employee demobilization can end in deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved ... conduct themselves proactively and have a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we called for a management revolution, which would be to put employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative usefulness
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, incite the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many laps, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behaviorist theory that the American “neurosciences” recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind their backs.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the “commands” (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management posture, unsuited to today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, implies adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into any business management reasoning or practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motivational Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of mobilisation factors, business managers can monitor, anticipate and anticipate their “social performance” and relocate human resource management “in place”.
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, the American right wing, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner had defended the concept of a “just war” against America’s enemies, cheered the speech Obama had delivered on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited the award given to Obama on Oct. 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, Ms. Palin, a leading figure in the Republican party’s right wing, told USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives rejoiced, who particularly appreciated the mention of “the existence of evil in the world” in the presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear from “a left-wing president” when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee “that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist.”
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as he “always does,” he “spoke like an American president” by reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they didn’t create and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the unconvinced right-wing few, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech “monotonous, pretentious and uninspired” on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the centre-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "overproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama “pronounced the speech that was necessary,” the New York Times estimated, judging it “both grim and uplifting.”
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the trade unions of the road sector and TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that ends the slogan of strike and the threat that falls on the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "rejoicing" about the agreement, after several negotiation sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday in hopes of quickly signing the text of the agreement late in the morning.
Even when three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by knocking.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict “would have been very damaging to businesses” and “there were fears that it would disrupt the holiday season,” Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some disconforming rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is a "good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages in view of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common-sense agreement that respects wage earners, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow to address above all the issue of an extraordinary payment and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a 100 million euro drop in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 rectification finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it “under the same terms.”
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to the companies affiliated to this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done “as soon as possible,” Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers’ organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced it as a "naive business", since the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but in order not to upset those who want to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, the Unostra lamented.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, unions disagree with the proposals of the RATP
Conflicts on the RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, are set to continue over the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the second day of strike between unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and unions were dissatisfied with their premium order.
For this important holiday shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10 am and 8 pm, at the rate of one train out of two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that “RATP strives to serve department stores.”
The RER A crosses the Parisian city from West to East.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran at peak hours, and almost no trains at valley hours, as had been expected.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
Thus, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had gotten up "an hour and a half earlier to get on time."
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said the SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday, analyzing the results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that was held with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of ERNs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol on all aspects of ERN A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers who claim a premium owed to them want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT commented indignantly, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday to conduct "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of practice of the profession," the RATP said.
Which also led unions to say that the company “didn’t care about weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independents have filed a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for shift schedules, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately provoked angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just extended a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Court President Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 of the party’s leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are detached from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned ahead of the verdict that MPs would leave parliament before becoming MPs without a partisan label.
The decision comes as a result of a proceeding launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no “organic links” to the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to escalating tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where large numbers of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have degenerated into clashes with police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city mostly populated by Kurds.
Order forces threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators hurled Molotov bombs or sling stones.
In Istanbul, about one hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deepen discouragement.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by dissolving a party, he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Braubburger wants.
It’s not something you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the EDF’s director of winter road maintenance
But with it your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
Weather forecasters may announce it for the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to handle snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A-sections come out with large vehicles with salt, explains Braubburger.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also accesses for the fire brigade, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloped sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
EDF service starts around 3 a.m.
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES starts around three in the morning, "with it the tracks are free until the rush hour traffic begins".
The hard part is when it starts to snow around 7:30 a.m.
“Then we have a problem,” says the director of road maintenance in winter, “because then no one is ready to clear space for salty vehicles.”
Immediately after, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which also belongs the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and side streets.
That’s where the discomfort comes in, Braubburger knows well.
Around five in the morning the FES infantry are launched, mainly the dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
Generally, the EDF would not be able to take over all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 10 pm to 4:30 pm does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Braubburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the vehicle with salt starts up as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The Dinosaur's Cradle
The Tawa trovae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-meter-long, 1.50-meter-high animal that ran on its two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa trovae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's journal Science.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, propagation, and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we’ve found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, something unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member at the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of five specimens.
Finding Confirms Theories of Ancient Dinosaur History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, about when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadrupedal sauropods known as "long-necked" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia a hervorb<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa trovae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa's skull, researchers found signs of air pockets, such as those also possessed by the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to air pockets, the birds’ breathing is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawae, the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air pockets, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of later giant sauropods also possessed air pockets and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers deduce that the saurians first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages were initially separated and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa finds the remains of two other theropods not very closely related.
The three cannot be descended from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are opponents as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, comments Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Their opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to dominant Mesozoic land vertebrates remains an enigma.
While in the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of modern crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species developed, while kinship became extinct on the boundary from the Triassic to the Jurassic.
Successful stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact curbed the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then led a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, are participating.
Participating teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police eviction from the busy casino of the Goethe University in Frankfurt had an impact all over the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, last week had the building occupied by students and teachers on an educational strike evicted because the walls and works of art were covered in propaganda.
As a result, five students were injured.
The material damages, the signatories judge, do not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the students and professors themselves by a police command".
The eviction represented an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to “delegitimize and criminalize protest” and diverted attention from the content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the legal claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for one’s own future, says Verdi’s national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), the Hessian Minister of Science, nevertheless defended the actions of the university rector and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in a broadcast of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the parliament of Wiesbaden province.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to the vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament to the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of studying the students’ arguments and demands thoroughly, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret armament research.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg Science Headquarters in Frankfurt, the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several visits were made to each other and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Protocol of close collaboration" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt he signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Sciences Research Centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relationships.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics consortia and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") was named after the landscape of forested mountains, in which research facilities settled.
Brakes from Stuttgart
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not set high enough at all.
For the supporters of the project it is simply and plainly "the new heart of Europe".
The law so.S21 is much more than reducing a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the region of Banden-Württemberg a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Railed terminals, which end in the middle of the city, were then considered engineering fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brakes on modern rail traffic, since in the past it took an enormous amount of time to engage the locomotives from back to front.
Roll, stop dry to continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that is why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about halfway between the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be started, even though the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course also have no more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE-built section towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have arranged it this way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic’s large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably computer generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The transit station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other rail projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be lacking in other crossings and narrow passages on the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the Ministry of Transport’s list.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the slow track has been built.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The Rhine Valley section will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the ruling on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the Wiesbaden Autonomous Parliament, if it is going to file an appeal before the ruling on the ban on night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The administrative court in Kassel had stated in writing on this date that in the case of the planned construction of the northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport, the state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as foreseen by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to file an appeal against this ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive their appeal to the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel’s recrimination that the federal government would be trying through misrepresentations of the law and tricks still get its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite a bit of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally flawless decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been your group’s claims about banning night air traffic.
U.S. banks are reimbursing aid.
The big American banks shaken by the crisis are stripping themselves of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned at once the aid that had been provided by the bank rescue fund Tarp of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
The Citi group also plans to repay state aid, according to a report by CNBC.
With this, the institutes aim to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The “Bank of America” had raised approximately 19 billion net worth through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had quite a few means, among others by the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers in particular on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the investment bank’s absorption effort at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to get money in the capital market so that it can free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a source of known circles that the US bank could announce by Thursday the increase of its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the Citi Group declined to comment.
Back in June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were back.
Quick Choice
In the end, everything went faster than we thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF’s board of directors pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may introduce a successor.
Last night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF’s main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely it also influenced the failure to further harm ZDF director Markus Schächter, if this proposal would also not be approved by the board of directors.
Schächter’s candidate, Frey, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet finalized at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the board with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender’s contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. The dismissal of Brender was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union on the board of directors already weeks before the election had indicated, they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the President of the Government of Hesse, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, that under Brender’s direction ZDF news reports would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which he scourged the political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, 35 public law experts had even meddled in the debate, calling Koch’s conduct unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked for the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The Greens' political party announced a constitutional lawsuit following the impeachment of Brender, who was elected as journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin" on Wednesday.
Koch’s opponent on the board, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federated states should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way that the director’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the ZDF control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender’s probable successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended himself to the board with a clever move: he sharply criticized the guild for removing Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a partisan henchman.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is attributed anyway to the liberals of the left.
College careers are cleared
Partial success for students: After a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave in. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor’s and master’s degrees.
Students in the future should be able to outperform their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module of the course must end with a single exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
The policy and the universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results among the universities inside and outside Germany.
The federated states undertake to make the structural rules more flexibly together for Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees.
Regulations of the federated states that diverge from this, should no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have continuously talked about the improvement of being able to carry out and successfully conclude a career (studyability).
Now for the first time a specific content was discussed.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: “Each module ends with a single exam,” says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university degrees.
"Sensitive reduction in the burden of examinations" is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, explained the director of the accreditation board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studyability" should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and content should be thoroughly examined as to unnecessary student restrictions in the choice of courses.
the courses.
Students would have “the right to get more space, which enables and encourages self-initiative.”
These rules would apply to new races, but also to the examination of existing races.
These must be "re-credited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until 2015 to examine all the races.
Those responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is installed by the federated states.
Education and culture ministers urged states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to adopt such measures.
Up to now only Rhineland-Platinate has ensured to provide additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam and foreign offices.
The federal state and the universities intend to have 10 million euros for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring a novel of university law to parliament.
According to her, a single exam should suffice for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the course should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all careers about their "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the state.
Aside from the praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal board of directors of the Juso (young socialist) university groups demanded that the configuration of education policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, students as principals involved should now be able to comment as well.
Margret Wintermantel, chair of the university board of rectors (HRK), gave her support to the students: “We need the students’ experience,” she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the union demands a legal right for every student with the bachelor’s degree to access a later Master’s degree.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough study places for Master with the best possible study conditions. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master’s degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is done virtually unchecked" says the first line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner in unbalanced language fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader at a children’s book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was given several literature prizes, in 1993 he gave the memorable poetry lectures in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse literature forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He gave enough talk last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Attempts at recruitment had begun slowly, in early 1971.
“Therefore I am someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against attempts to provoke fear from the Securitate,” Söllner said.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary polemic with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that evidences the abysses and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know so far, not only an author, but also a victim.
Walter had played a role in his Securitate IM file, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner’s confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of the IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him on all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this statement,” he said.
Söllner’s statement in this form and in front of this public was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies from the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, Herta Müller wrote in July in the weekly "Zeit", after reading her own 914-page dossier.
Those involved will surely have speculated and in some cases have known what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, dealing with the files of the control by the Securitate is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather in the background.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of records.
An interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke derogatoryly of the decorated.
"She has psychosis," she was only questioned once in the end.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself without turning in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there are silent faults.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession leaves us to hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the cravings for knowledge and not so much by the adjudication of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in literature, it is more than a simple footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team’s supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it seemed as if a stylishly dressed outside service member was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had handed out samples.
The man of the bald feature had hired a driver, because he still did not know the city.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old drunk with joy.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work would begin again.
Or it would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the eighth round", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni, from Romania, "but we can not let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The “much more important task” awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sweepstakes
The Champions League round of 16 (departure matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return matches on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So joy was limited by the fulminant entrance of Babbel’s successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who in a short time had inspired the bewildered professionals of Stuttgart self-confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more pitched, explained the soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He displayed a certain magic, Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann accepted, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to an injury quickly advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the perceived "phenomenon" with the proverbial "cool wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what had been missing, evidently, when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also refrained from overestimating the win against a defense weakened by lack of relays and totally outdated by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had come the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We have not overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt did not feel like celebrating on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced harsh criticism from Lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in management to the board of directors, who had decided to change coaches because of pressure from teenage fans.
Also that he would have eliminated his day off after the games, Lehmann described it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by sheer selfishness,” Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the defender.
They will probably no longer be friends forever, the two forties.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the substituted coach team, the spectacle of great game and battle force would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had “an important part in the success,” Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Burning duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was teasing world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version of the association beat American Kevin Johnson on Friday night in Berne by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had hoped for could not be carried out.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators at the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2,02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimetres lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging the world champion’s blows again and again, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right hand to his target.
Generally speaking, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie", who "can't do anything".
While weighing, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to remove Johnson’s sunglasses from his nose “so he can see his eyes.”
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he beat Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time, and had recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to hand over without a fight.
That year he beat Juan Carlos G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in his defenses of the title.
In this fight I received only one blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to bring together all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
The summer before, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has blamed Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) for knowingly deceiving.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast on the ARD television channel, the head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Troop for the Protection of Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was reported that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German Kunduz commander, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, as many as 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel has to clarify whether an intentional assassination strategy is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy, and whether the chancellery, army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The foreign ministry did not exert any influence over the German army’s concrete actions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday there had also been doubts about the presentation by the Ministry on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it emerged that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
There has been no response so far, he said.
The ministry did not speak out on Saturday regarding the reproaches made to it, noting that this would be clarified in the commission of inquiry of the Federal Parliament, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
In a waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unhindered surrender to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during wakefulness, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is considered most often in the modern Western world as a madman or drug addict, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in the drug addicts.
The fault lies with our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
Dream-modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Casta<0xC3><0xB1>eda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychoses and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts often occur.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived of hallucinations as a form of sleep in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness to the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the dispurposes, formations and dislocations".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
Her body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red faces like blood, deformed, grinding their teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Shrill, malignant voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires from the stereo, ties them together to form a hanging knot, and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope is loose.
What a lesson for you!, the voices shout in a chorus that bursts your eardrums, "Go to the clinic and make them heal you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he has been married.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in a lifetime from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent illness after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the doors to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed to him.
At the same time he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, “the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is.”
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are supported by reality, distance from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it’s still unclear why our brains make cabriolets.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to temporarily lose touch with reality.
But not everyone develops a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which also does not manifest at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when a previous arrangement already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmitting system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experiment with some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The unreal world in our head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychoses, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranioencephalic traumas .
Surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer from hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or are little co-hided; when our brain warms up, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, love sickness or other exceptional brain states.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem bestimmten Teil des Lebens, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren't for those images and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other pupils look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she’s not dreaming.
She wakes up and sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes she wonders if she’s crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he sometimes cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest he explains the mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for sleep to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, she does not know whether she is awake or dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimace or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he yells at the figures.
Her parents and friends didn't tell her anything, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations have been gone for a year.
Ever since she got in touch via the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while they will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and takes care of itself to seek entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he has called father since he had the use of reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," Kasten says, "takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
In this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful illness but it also entails something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that subsequently can not distinguish from being awake.
Dream-conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor incapacity, he replaces a very dangerous real situation with an imaginary world of his own that is decoupled from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a change of world occurs, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own creative capacity allows us not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwegsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old when his conscience embarked on multi-day trips following heart valve surgery with heart transplantation included, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by himself and visited strange places of other times: he found himself prostrating in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching over his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed over his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and ran into a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, it describes your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychoses, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
The children will take over the publishing house at the age of 27.
The new editor Kallen has come up with a tentative solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding company will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if you are trained to do so.
One cannot put their children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end up with the kids and the company.
Burda announced Thursday that he will retire from the chairmanship of the board in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This 52-year-old member of the Kallen family has been a member of Burda’s management since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for the technology.
After Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure, he took over the treasury and responsibility for the company’s assets. After Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure, he also took over direct marketing, overseas, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the apex of the publishing house.
Burda’s sons are 19 and 17 years old, and her son Felix, who is now 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s designation also serves to, “save the differences of 10, 15 years,” according to Burda.
100% of the holding company will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from decline: “This has always affected families who let themselves be infected by the quest for capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I’ve never had “delusions of greatness,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play Time in the world league either; those deals have gotten too big.
Integral beauty
Everything you could wish for - in terms of beauty and well-being - at your fingertips.
This is what seems to have been proposed El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the mall of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious brands such as Hedonai -which is in charge of laser hair removal-; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the tea shop stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to ride your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n offers.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to correctly perform our exercise table.
Its director says that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretches) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
Varied necklines
Christmas is approaching and it never hurts to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that is going to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote the activities of Research and Technological Development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in terms of the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has active a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has implemented throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants," said the president of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has reduced by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "by 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Car Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and motorsport fans.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you be able to find motorcycles and classic cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the motor world.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the classic engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, catering; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and catering; or Cochera Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Ability Testing Abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be conducted with classic cars and motorcycles on an enabled circuit outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda wants to show that sportiness is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system -named i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation Mazda3 stands out for the good rating achieved in its entirety.
The finishes, the completion of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver’s seat, we find that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and support.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument cluster and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the one also presented by the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese has more than enough room for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-liter, 150-horsepower petrol engine and the six-speed manual gearbox.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its reduced noise, for the performance and for achieving a low consumption.
Although the Mazda3 will be the most demanded diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high comfort of walking, and for its low consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is to say the one that incorporates a greater number of elements of series.
The standard equipment includes the Lane Change Assist (RVM), which eliminates blind spots, traction and stability controls, speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large display, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, as if its equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: bixenon adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in its class.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for their behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 2.0 gasoline engine of 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day great doses of satisfaction.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality with Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever shrouded in models as elegant as 'sexy' in the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, without even the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Due to the success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It’s just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance fee, around 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone already know what it’s like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a cafeteria with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly appealing and would long ago have to be up and running.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and a good glasses to read the small print.
The European Commission’s repeated ear-dragging to achieve affordable roaming rates for all of Europe has barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is a fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (it is curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of rates means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It is a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month to month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a purchase option with lifetime access like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my email on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it’s a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is, without a doubt, the favorite tone of the American First Lady.
If you have already come to the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, you have chosen the same to accompany him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -green yellow with bright reflections-, the two times the outfit consisted of three pieces -dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric-, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the First Lady of the United States was following in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat dress.
But the fabric on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was about a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with print.
The accessories have also varied: green half-heeled shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one collected on this occasion, mane releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had labor problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fertility and career path of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of coexistence as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, start coexistence as a couple, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years old with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting coexistence, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time of their life trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on motherhood but less on the timing of mating," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they marry and have the first child.
The difference also remains between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education were first-time mothers at 25.1 and 32.1 on average, respectively.
"There is also another division among women based on their level of education.
While those who have elementary education get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and prioritize obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child, "details Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, singing the universal slogan of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous signings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetic brand also features luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives – designers and models, yesterday and today – gathered at the annual awards ceremony, which was held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
There was no one missing from the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent gives away in 'P<0xC3><0xB3>quer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in some cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creative character.
The trip has its excitements and Vicent does not spare scares or enlightenment.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to read and reread.
Here are some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same that I felt without name: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, senseless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, to be climbed by the north wall, from which the best climbers climb again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was heir to a county landowner and others that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
Dorothy Parker: "One day she got down on her knees and prayed, 'God darling, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'Dream after effort, / after storm the port, / rest after war, / after life full pleases death.'"
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage she also brought her depressions.
The husband would normally accept that she told him that Edward VII spied on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
About Pio Baroja: "What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja by Faulkner's guns?
What did Cela do but abduct the fame of that man so that it would serve as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a specimen of mixed race, rescued from the kennel and weighing no more than six kilos and, without a word, they kicked him two that left the dog injured.
Our indignation is capitalized because we do not find the fun in a gratuitous assault on a small and helpless animal, which, by the way, was tied up.
To this must be added the suffocation that provoked a lady who walked quietly and who, when he rebuked these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since an energumen who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident happened at five in the afternoon of any Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubted would be useful for much and not to generate susceptibilities, only to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to mistreat a helpless animal that gives us affection, companionship and friendship for free.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among younger riders, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day” and that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe products.
Increases the sale of light commercials
Nearly two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of the Anfac manufacturers and the Ganvam sellers.
The good data, not obbtive, should be quarantined since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of the last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold in addition to all the vehicles that make up the tailor’s drawer of light commercials: derivatives of passenger cars, pick ups, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Also, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
To the restrictions imposed by the closed tap on bank loans, other factors must be added, such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In the face of this scenario and unlike the cars, the aids to purchase 2000E have been of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed people and SMEs who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer can benefit, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists (trucks and buses).
The sales association forecasts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is already mandatory
As happened with the ABS anti-lock brakes and will pass with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of absence is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, due to its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions per range.
The emergency braking assistant increases the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver’s step.
But it doesn’t always hold that pressure until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, one-third of drivers involved in an accident had failed to step on the brakes before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, demands the maximum from the braking system, reducing the distance that the car uses to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided a year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors Delays Plan for Opel to January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the 8th probably - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, GM Europe’s new president, intends is that each of the points in the plan has been previously agreed upon by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
GM says a decision on Saab’s sale should be made in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of Dutch sports car maker Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining traction.
Should there be no deal with either of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold remains.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop their latest, expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, in the first place, with the automatic roof that has been supplemented by one of canvas with manual operation, which saves 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they gained 7 kilos more; mounting sports racquets another 12 inches, and with the llants.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door handles for one of fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the dual-clutch PDK gearbox, the test was performed on a unit with the six-speed manual gearbox, mainly on California secondary roads, on mountain stretches with really twisted tracks.
Their behavior can only be described as impeccable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not tread the asphalt with aplomb.
Quite the opposite: we hadn’t tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time that, at the same time, it conveyed so much safety in the cornering, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short gear for the time necessary, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and squeeze his engine again...
Thanks to his address, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already premiered previously in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, either from standstill or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the bumps well.
The electronic aids hardly made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate with Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the parades of the 'maison', the singer wastes her bag face with as much contempt as her Chanel bags.
More than ‘Bad Girl’ or ‘It Girl’, she is a ‘Bag Girl’.
Baskonia wins in Israel
The Caja Laboral scored a brilliant 82-91 win on their visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra court, despite the numerous casualties that Dusko Ivanovic’s team had, and in this way they are in the lead of their group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 points).
The Victorian team was able to supplement the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with great doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer until the end to take the victory.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do in the final triumph.
The match started face-to-face for the Azulgranas, who put themselves from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians came from the perimeter already foreshadowed that they had jumped on the Israeli court with hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for the inner game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was greeted with whistles and applause on the return to his home, to continue expanding his advantage at rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less than six' rating of Splitter already predicted that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being on the road to rest, was not decided at all and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court no one wins, and with the 'hand of Elijah' s squeezing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini decisively contributed to the 'yellows' turning the luminous (50-49).
More inconveniences
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but no less dead, needed to spin a couple of plays correctly to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring rent (54-67), which managed to make up the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavese left to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign themselves and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic's did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the game already had an owner and the victory was escaping from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent fighting the Unicaja
Unicaja lost in Greece to Olympiacos and handed him the lead of the Euroleague group B, in a match marked by the casualties of the caixistas, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and neither by the rival entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from baseman Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, 9th minute.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, 13th minute, at which point an action, with a fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to function showing its superiority within both areas, where the injury loss of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez, were weighing on the caixistas.
Between the inner players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with their triples, they increased the lead 44-32, 19th minute.
An Impossible Rebound
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, showed superiority and even equalled the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, 27th minute, which made the group’s lead wobble.
The Unicaja were trying to overcome the absences and the last loss of Scottish center Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja for the direction and triples of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when they pressed and given their superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian center Nikola Vujcic managed to rebound the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja shut down, handing the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The tool How much should you collect? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is running, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 that receives a Spanish one.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros net annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by dependent, with 14,725 euros; and operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker jobs.
Brazil set a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has put an end to Manuel Zelaya’s stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, when he would officially end his term.
Francisco Catunda, business manager at Brazil's embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date from the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, when his term ends, he has to look for another destiny."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
This week, however, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately thwarted by rejecting Zelaya's status as a political asylee imposed on him by the "de facto" government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising as it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by buying assets directly and indirectly by giving liquidity-free bars to near-zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are starting to throw some sand in the gears as the ECB did with its year-over-year auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have rebounded, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they hit at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing a widening of the spreads of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go wrong to silence moral risk advocates who were once again trying to raise awareness about those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving day.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore power in the emirates and Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on its external payments earlier this year and to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to make its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads widen, as do European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If the European spreads decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor’s is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, that they return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augurs much life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it has all the looks that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, driver friend".
Related sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which these days the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is discussed.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n gave the press a brushstroke of what he had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants are kept open today in operation.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Of course, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be destined to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and the power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW are needed, yes, with other "supporting energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who considers that the bill on a sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to fight against climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "point-by-point" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n considers that investment decisions, even if they are long-term, must start to be taken already because they are slow to mature and a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus 'handling' at 10 airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not transcended, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Center
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the center’s tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n disputes its first motorway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
He is fighting for his first motorway concession in Australia, a market in which he already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel worth 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
Frenchwoman Bouygues and sister Hochtief are his rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a highway builder and concessionaire.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan supervised by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
Pending their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia with a notable presence of European construction companies compete.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in the league, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the ACCIONA team, the Northern Direct consortium plays, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the also local Baudrstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specializing in civil works Razel share capital.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatizations, but it entails a clear difficulty of entry if not by way of the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger have followed, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has barely achieved a position in this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Assets millionaires
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Their intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called the Northern Link, is intended to connect the western Toowong Highway with the ring road at Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel. It is the largest action to reduce congestion in traffic in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this payment step would be open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its financing.
Brisbane now offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear notable fruit to Hochtief, who announced yesterday that he had been awarded a contract with the government worth $154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This action will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and give the German woman a job for 18 months.
In addition, the company has transferred the construction project of the 27-story King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. Work was yet to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale at 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O’Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for €64.5 million.
The firm gets this contract days after taking over the extension works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its execution period will be extended by 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore Awarded Renfe Advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that submitted to the competition called by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA which was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined $63 million for curbing competition
France’s competition regulator has imposed a €63 million fine on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for blocking its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and that, therefore, it is repeat offences.
App Store
In addition, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since it was founded in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club to have won the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory but is also a major source of revenue for major clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5.362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out well from this cast.
The white club has been the third in the continent that has pocketed the most money to participate, and the only one, alongside AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also billed the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved more money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distributed
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA’s complicated money-sharing procedure.
For this exercise, the body that presides Michel Platini plans to enter 1.090 million through the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each game they play.
There are also bonuses to win (800,000 euros) and to draw (400,000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the eight fourth finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be pocketed 4 million each.
The champion will win $9 million, compared to the finalist's $5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million to win the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main, and has four assigned places.
The previous year's champion gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year’s edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday outlined the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public takeover bid (opa) for all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be repaid with an interest for said deferral of 1% annually
Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros yesterday; therefore, Nueva Rumasa’s offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerez group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, despite the Ruiz Mateos company claiming that it had contacted the regulator.
If carried out, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay away from possible purchase offers and the judicial fluctuations of its former managers, the brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will reveal new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former councilors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Court that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
CNMV authorizes the exclusion of Paternina Opa presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion opa presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina last October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation on the understanding that its terms comply with the current rules and consider "sufficient" the content of the explanatory brochure presented after the changes introduced last December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is directed to the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which can not be transmitted in any way until the completion of the offer, from which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New Tools for Car Experts
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a crash are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No loss is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a long and complicated job.
Calculating annually the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools it would be a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided to them by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of appraisal tools and information processing on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from straightforward.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that more versions, variants and drives have been released in the last five years than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car hits the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very arduous task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image is made of each model where different parts of tourism can be "pricked".
If it is a mass-sale model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information on 99.2% of the cars that are sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile fleet that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every other day.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for managing scrapping parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that professionals in the sector can provide.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution for claims assessment, aimed at experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting scales.
This tool is paid according to use, for each rating.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of expert reviews, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only by its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on the windows of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet that allows bids for vehicles declared total loss.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analyses or know the deviations by brands or models.
It can be studied, for example, how many models of a certain brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or official prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown or maintenance of the car.
The Gt Appraisals Guide is your historical benchmark product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their turnover has grown at a rate of 20% annually in the last three years, and in 2008 they invoiced 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange, and now its shares are listed for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Accidental Cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The transaction involved a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the capital of the company, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sale service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, leasing companies, workshops, scrapyards and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been dropped cannot be recirculated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even if they have been discharged after some strenuous efforts.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Workshop tool, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in only four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a budget and generate a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent are usually more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 off-roaders, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalog of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented system does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
