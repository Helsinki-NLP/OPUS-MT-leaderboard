Members of the Assembly of Wales fear "passing through Marretas"
There is a dismay on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) about the suggestion that its title be changed to MWP (Welsh Members of Parliament).
The origin of this controversy lies in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
Some members of this assembly, from all political backgrounds, fear that this will make them ridiculous.
A Labour AM said the group is concerned that "the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrement".
A Plaid AM stated that the group as a whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP said the group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a similar pronunciation to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The House Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the House are appointed will obviously be made by themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave its assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which noted widespread support for the proposal to designate the Assembly as the "Welsh Parliament".
On the issue of the title of the MOUs, the Commission favoured "Members of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to assemble consensus could be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to come forward with draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the Assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of MOUs and the configuration of the committee system.
When they debate the legislation, the MAs will have the final say on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians to vote for change of name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a complaint about its territory, and has repeatedly objected to its requests for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no more than the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin’s Bells Shut Down as Harlem Churches Fight for Survival
“From a historical perspective, the seniors I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
“People socialize differently,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms in the neighborhood that people regularly go to.”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of heritage will not last as long as the leaders expect and that, sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the starting point.
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the neighborhood’s remaining shrines.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so that will hasten the coming of the day when these churches will all close, for it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later taken over by a black congregation that performed its services in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promoting black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged; however, when plans were made for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the chimes "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the chime in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and an “irreplaceable historical instrument.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the major carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather stated that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What took place at St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that it "would try to pass on the costs", regretting the fact that it was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old in California Lobster Hunting Diving
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunt dive in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help, then rowing towards him with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but later realized the boy was yelling "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The entire area of the collarbone was torn, Hammel described what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper trunk.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style cosmetics sections backed by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion apparel and household goods decline, these largest cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out in more stores next year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from supermarkets’ demand for ways to use exhibition space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty product portfolio with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products obey vegan precepts, something increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, perfume shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. The second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and the shift from grocery shopping habits to small daily quantities in local stores has led to supermarkets now having to work harder to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores, and has also installed a number of Habitats, as it acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this has boosted sales of grocery products and made acquisitions more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from health products stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It was said that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby quit <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby abandoned an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for the brand of household items and accessories Truly.
Their business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she would be leaving the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons star Den Peter Jones livid by dropping the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was "furious" when the TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) implied she would no longer have time to devote to her brand of Truly household goods and accessories.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his holiday homes abroad.
A source said: “Truly was by far Holly’s top priority.
It would mean resolving their long-term future and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely astonished.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning host, who is among Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions, given the hefty investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for additional launch delays.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couples go on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that "We do not intend to comment on his business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
The US president jokingly mentioned criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump claimed, in his voice pretending to be a "newspaper pivot".
"I didn't give in to anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, stressing that it would be a major step in North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations for denuclearisation are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the United States to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
“It’s going very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: an end to rocket tests, support for the release of hostages, and the return to the country of the remains of U.S. military personnel.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when he talked about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia wreak havoc on island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been evicted, it was not declared a national catastrophe, a prerequisite for the channeling of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have in many cases made it clear that they are not seeking international help, so it is becoming a bit difficult," said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team headed to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for the wraths of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastlines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, badly the validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, travelling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who has made decrepit infrastructure improvement a centerpiece of his election campaign, has spent huge sums on roads and railroads.
However, funding shortages have plagued Mr. Joko’s executive as he faces re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted as Christian and Muslim bands fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes a long shot for the draw goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, with his team losing 1-0.
He tapped to his left before making a shot towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed to the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to reach that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving forward as much as possible, so I was just winning as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I gave him a touch, and I didn't think too much about it, I just finished."
Chelsea won 1-0 at halftime after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In that move, the blue forward gave Mateo Kovacic a back heel pass before demarcating near midfield and sprinting towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass to midfield.
He then made a nice shot that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the big area.
This overtook the defenses and made the goal against the net of the second beam with a shot with the left foot that passed the goalkeeper Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, Indonesia's disaster response agency said on Sunday.
There are reports of large numbers of people trapped in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters in height, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing woman to death
A homicide investigation has begun after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who may have witnessed something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to everyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images with dashboard cameras, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us as they may have crucial information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, with police saying they are informing the victim's close relatives at this time.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to gain access to his apartment, but has been told by police that entry or exit of the building is prohibited.
When he was told what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being told that they will only be able to return to their homes within hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly claims that "it's so horrible."
At two in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the area immediately outside.
A number of police officers were posted inside the cordon to guard the apartment building.
We ask anyone with information to contact DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament became the latest monument engulfed by the contention of "historical revisionism"
Their removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for their destruction, reminiscent of that perpetrated by the Taliban, of so many British cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that, in the current debate over statue removal, Oliver Cromwell's figure at Westminster Palace would become a target to be shot.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of homage.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than he is today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes an entirely accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety who represents one side of that division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of homage and celebration.”
Pig Killer Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with an artery cut and covered in blood, near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reads in Sunday's South China Morning Post.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to have traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to a nearby open porch.
In that pighouse, he said, was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 227-pound pig had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and crushed,” said the cousin, referred to by his nickname “Wu,” according to Guiyang Evening News.
Footage from security cameras shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent it from attacking others while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Reports say Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can act as a “stimulant.”
"They're just kidding.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them proper respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa Remains to Bring Widespread Heavy Rain to Southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it travels over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, it will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa was causing 137 km/h gusts, a Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As it approaches the Baja California Peninsula, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push strong tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S. zone.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rains in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain could cause dangerous flash flooding, debris-sprinkling, and possibly alliations of desert land.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly aggravating conditions is possible due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is highly inadvisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy precipitation can cause gorges to turn into raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong point winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring heavy rainfall over parts of Southern California’s coastline.
Total rainfall of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause small floods of debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the wet season in the region.
Tropical rains in Arizona will begin to disperse late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more dispersed late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October can experience strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools, however, tropical areas will remain quite mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences across the U.S. central zone on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to record a warm early October, with temperatures pervasive between 27 and 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could hit 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. by the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched yesterday on six television stations the sweeping testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, stated that he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people, a number Nielsen found on Friday, are likely to have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulty measuring audiences of those who watch programs in offices.
To give some perspective, it is a level of audiences similar to the final of an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh’s nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Next comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying his vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being verbally attacked by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator to address a Judiciary Commission hearing.
The senator stood motionless looking down while being criticized live on CNN cameras.
"I stand here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that “you have power while so many women have no power.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee went to a vote to have Kavanaugh’s nomination proceed to a plenary vote in the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, which the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, as it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'politicising' Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politicising" Britain's future and harming the national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the front-page of the paper, its former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the Brexit minister’s “Chequers Plan,” saying a proposal that Britain and the EU cover the other side’s tariffs is “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Detain Suspect Dyteon Simpson from LSU Player Death
Police arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, with police saying Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, reports WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he had fatally shot Wayde with a firearm.
A bail of $350,000 has been established, the lawyer said.
The forensic office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that extended to the neck.
The department said the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Action Group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and area residents who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked area officials for their “diligence and effort to get justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano have hit neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Sunday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash within 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in the volcano’s activity, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between Catalan police and separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and the intervention police, as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, caught by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are normally packed with tourists.
There were also clashes later, in which the police resorted to batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups chanting “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive” clashed with unionist protesters shouting “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, the local press reports.
Tensions remain high in the independence-prone region, a year after the October 1 referendum that was deemed illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although voter turnout had been low, with a majority boycott of those opposed.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it was held, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was participating in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry with joy that they could vote, but now we are blocked,” he said.
Despite a vital but tangential victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained pending trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year’s elections.
"To run as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may also have fired a crossbow at the car.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, stunned the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changes level, with the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s team, which remains without a home win in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders with eight more points next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston have extended their succession of losing games in the division to six games, with head coach Holt not losing a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against numbed visitors
Holt’s team should have been ahead of the mark long before the goal, as the incisiveness of his game was causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but was dragged in front of the goal and then Alan Lithgow only managed to direct his effort away after sneaking to find Craig Halkett's header over the goal.
The home team was satisfied to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that it could cause problems for the visitors in the stop ball plays.
And that’s how the crucial goal came about.
Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass for Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the big area.
At that point, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a touch away from Livingston's other stop ball play.
Crossings continued to come to the Livingston area, which were successively resolved, and two heavy penalty claims, one after Halkett's stroke of substitute Glenn Middleton and another after a hand, were turned down by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - review
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall at their best throughout the game.
In any case, the Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team fell far short of these standards.
Their final move was uninspired (they only once managed to open the home team), a sort of warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan ambiguously received in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside its country.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were nearby to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, near 10:15 British summer time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died at the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist was killed in a runaway collision on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the person and inform his family.
Barriers and detours were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Injured in Disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the prison office said.
The unrest, which is still going on, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents "Tornado" have been summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one ward.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison services spokesman said: “Specially trained teams have been used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it must be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they may spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disorder in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s predicted for early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, posing the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for areas south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rains.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals reaching 10 mm.
For those unaffected by the risks of flash flooding, the Rosa rain can be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall may be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
“According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers at least one extreme drought, the second-most severe category,” Weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the mainland by crossing the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still hurricane-force on Sunday morning, with winds at top speeds of 137 km/h, lies 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to hit the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at nightfall on Monday.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 8 to 10 mm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a maximum of 25 mm possible," the website weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then head south to Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or its remnants is very high rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the Southwestern U.S. Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are predicted to produce sudden floods and floods of debris in the deserts, at risk of life, and allusions in mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with sharp gun wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace near 4 a.m. British summer time on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area were arrested overnight, police in Avon and Somerset said.
Agents have appealed to anyone who may have cell phone footage of the alleged incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh “was a victim of the evil and anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “was a victim of the malice and anger” of the Democratic Party during its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually abused her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his claim.
The president said Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" on that day.
“A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation by one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a jurist with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president later referred to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he talked about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not competing, but I’m actually competing,” he said.
"That's why I'm going all over the place fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy of the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesian Earthquake and Tsunami; Number Continues to Rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them dragged by the gigantic waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred in the aftermath of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of what happened," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency to mitigate the effect of Indonesia's (BNPB) disasters, said in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not move by itself: it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs released by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges deformed and demolished, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be rocked by aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive quake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, the statement said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications "were totally disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had struck Palu, although authorities said the waves came as the warning was issued.
In an amateur video released on social media, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to the people on the street below.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hit the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities. However, the evacuees still desperately need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to Palau's evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is rising exponentially to more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although he managed to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of their offices, Donggala World Vision personnel went through scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began to begin the grim tasks of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign financing, supplies and personnel can only have access to the site if it is declared a “national disaster zone”.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still at a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national catastrophe,’ we can open the door to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist.”
Falling from the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the still-missing still held out hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigate the shadowy headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, which were concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paraglider, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon said that in the hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse began circulating among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s athletes, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark, rather than a pair of blues.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While busy, another man “came running after the Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money intended for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, “The being formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, was given the nickname Ye some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons," the creator of the show said.
Being at the same time an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when commenting on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"Therefore, I am you, I am us, we are us.
It comes from Kanye, which means “the one,” to just Ye – being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator JAY-Z also used variations of his name with or without hyphens and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO commits not to resort to military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the army to repress the Mexican people."
Military personnel fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have amounted to 300, when leftist student movements were spreading across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who study and opening more public universities.
The president said unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. to double funding for artificial intelligence
At a time when China is stepping up its AI business, the U.S. is expected to double its spending on AI research, said Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made announcements related to AI, even though the country lacks a formal global AI strategy.
However, China presented its plan last year: it aims to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the research budget on AI would be a good start, given that all other countries are so behind the U.S. and we are in pursuit of the new AI revolution,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI success will be achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the top-ranked American Othello player. Later, he held executive roles at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's branch in China.
Lee gave credit to previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Department Agency’s Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a big effort to get state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is stealing academic leaders; it’s the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university fixtures to work on AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically awarded to doctorates in AI,” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is inferior in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in an AI Next-designated initiative.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation intended to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence hasn’t moved forward in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbor's name represents a complaint about its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised questions about whether the voter turnout will be enough to meet the 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue admission efforts in bodies with the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The national election commission said there had been no records of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
“I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on changing the country's name, which would open the doors for their accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was setting up a small stage and putting up chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up and not through the door of service,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
According to him, a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, less than the necessary influx.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed, the turnout must be over 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major blunder in the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero crosses all of Brighton's defence towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overturned Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the play.
He sprinted between Brighton's three defenses before cutting to open field.
He was surrounded by four green shirts.
He finished one defense before neutralizing others in the race on the edge of the Brighton area.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the wide area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-side shot.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League showdown.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball right on Brighton's territory in that move.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank for Leroy Sane.
This gave a few taps before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field limits.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life harder for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there was not much reason to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer is hoping to take the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the final for the Rockies, who hold a lead in a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their first-division title.
“Even if we’re playing for nothing, at least we can get on the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete under those conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting pitcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the pitches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, did a bullpen session on Thursday and would pitch in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander goes 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president referred laterally to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of the Republican influx in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I’m not running, but I’m running and so I’m everywhere fighting for excellent candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You’re seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you’re seeing it happen right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary. Do they see the evil, the sordidness?
They don’t care who they attack, who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
"And you've seen that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, evil, sordid and lying."
The president referred to Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, and has received booing from the public.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did it cause the document to leak?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I, wait, one — that was a really bad body language — the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant of those who openly give their opinion.
When the Momentum activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it came as no surprise to me.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour Members in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan was similarly treated because she resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday mentioned that “we intend the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the General Committee meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings, and the promise of “kinder and gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever came to fruition.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because the colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to take a turnaround and to take positions with which I would never agree - whether they were on national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public (and it doesn’t really matter what I say), there follows a torrent of insults on social media calling for “firing,” denouncing the center’s policies, telling me that I shouldn’t belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just me going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never back down from them.
One of the aspects that most disappoint me in this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with every motion of “censorship” or change of selection rules the party narrows its sights.
I’ve received countless advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, so as not to be so expressive, that it would be “all right” for me.
But that's not why I came here to do politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in rubble, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, either as mayor or as a minister in government.
I never hid my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who pushed the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is headed for a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of “sudden dismissal” or political expedients will prevent me from acting in the direction of what I believe to be the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals somehow skewed the outcome, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent’s Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The credit goes to Ayr. They managed the risks better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute rehearsal, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned to the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr’s lead with a big penalty, before, immediately before halftime, he scored and then converted a solo rehearsal to put the score at 17-5 for Ayr at halftime.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption followed due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who was transported from stretcher to outside and, after the restart, the Ayr reinforced the leadership with a rehearsal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and once again Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted rehearsal by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense rush of pressure.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking Climo down without the ball, in the penalty throw, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind Ayr's progressing maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent wing Gregor Henry to the fifth rehearsal of the home team.
Still Game Star Ready for a New Career in the Restoration Business
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears poised to enter the catering industry after being named director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and participates with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, due to premiere soon, will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was intending to become involved in the "flourishing Glasgow restoration business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, landlocked country, hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a rope-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings display a navy blue flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Getting it back is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean, is still alive.
These hopes are perhaps at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will witness the release of the TIJ’s sentence on giant screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of their country’s claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," the president's votes were cast last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even if it did not.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the court’s ruling is handed down only six months after hearing the final allegations indicates the case was “uncomplicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined some Chilean residual goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision process was unusually quick.
Next Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a possibility of “ending 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never waive its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea Says There Will Be No Disarmament Without U.S. Trust
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to deliver on the promises it made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart deadlocked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "impossible dream" to consider that continued sanctions and the U.S. objection to a declaration that would put an end to the Korean War would ever cause the North to kneel.
Washington fears accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang actually intends to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on their way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which left the style set amazed at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very impractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most notable piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide feather-like flap that flooded the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewelled watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, although the same were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in time for the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue this immense fashion statement, you're in luck.
Styling observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of the "La Bomba", the straw hat with a flap of 61 cm that has been worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that spread through social networks sent another great creation to the catwalks: a straw beach bag almost as large as the model in a bathing suit that carried it.
The raffia bag in burnt orange, adorned with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ spring-summer 2019 La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m looking forward to seeing big hats and beach bags coming to stores next summer. Since the designer had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, and this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional test scores, bolstered by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students spread across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further study and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a bespoke school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought after theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter his heart.”
This quote reminds us that we cannot just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we found that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum grade of A.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained the maximum grade of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that Scottish independent schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will unquestionably serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and beyond.
A survey by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that, among the reasons for employers’ difficulty filling vacancies, 17% concerned a lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a fitness for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio of 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Multilingual proficiency, particularly in developing countries, will give children better chances of finding relevant employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them for success, whatever the future holds.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron kicks off at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is coming to an end for fans looking to see LeBron James kick off at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James will participate in Sunday’s preseason opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is still to be determined.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump begins a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of conformation pending for his pick for the Supreme Court seat, Trump plans to bolster support for the midterm elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s hearings with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate’s expected confirmation vote will be on hold for a week as the FBI proceeds with investigations.
However, the main goal of this torrent of rallies is to help Republicans facing tough elections in November gain some momentum.
President Trump’s campaign officials said the five rallies next week were meant to “energize volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and broaden the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so critical to the president’s agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the turmoil of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the late-night rally could draw supporters “from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get Pittsburgh-area media coverage,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, down in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and help him with the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of impetus is a totally invented sporting concept, but it is one that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the impetus is coming now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so we’re looking at that as a bit of momentum, I’d say,” Spieth said as he was off the field at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and plenty of reason to feel encouraged, especially given the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural cries of celebration were getting louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the 15th game produced a similar cry, one that reveals that he still believes the American team remains in the competition.
“We just need to focus and care about our own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, are four in four and can’t go wrong.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea is consolidated that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no player more popular to seal a potential European victory at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated this morning's fourball hero Sergio Garcia when they teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine pushed the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close due to the interactions between the partners, the advice they give or not and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant lead in the final day. However, this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a loose lead after coming out of Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods struggling to reach the Le Golf National classification, so far, by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to keep the trophy it lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the two-game foursomes, but failed to shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12th singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to earn four points in a row when he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are just the only duo to earn four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating a powerless Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled through two games on Saturday, revealed occasional flashes of genius, but has lost 19 of his fourball and foursome games, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always take the best.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the top men's tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duo took a courageous 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did a team reverse a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although Furyk's title-holder team only needed to tie to keep the trophy.
After two days in second place, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea Says 'No Thinking' of Unilateral Disarmament Without Trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were aggravating distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country could unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons under the circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see any corresponding U.S. response," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can proceed with our disarmament first.”
While Ri has recycled well-known North Korean grievances about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded as it takes gradual steps, his statements appear to be significant in that they do not liminally reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast to Pyongyang’s previous positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump offered security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on “denuclearization first” and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, opposing even the “declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is aggravating our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the stakeholder in this issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stalemate."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that steering North Korea’s rockets into U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump called Kim the “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but said much remained to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a timetable for it, saying that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must proceed vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to strangle the funding of North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, although North Korea later denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States “takes corresponding action.”
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they were looking for were Trump's security assurances in Singapore, as well as efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend course that teaches them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all of its students to sleep longer, in an initiative to combat the sexist culture of studying in caffeine-soaked “directs.”
One professor concluded that the students of this university at the top of the world ranking often had not the slightest idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you just telling me this in the last year of school?’
She said no one had ever mentioned to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as we all have a right to know the health effects of the smoking option,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “making straight” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we get enough quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid getting fat, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a campus-wide course, he said.
The next step, according to your expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to consider using an alarm for bedtime, such as waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulate the circadian rhythm and lead to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another outburst of sadness when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team a 1-0 loss at Livingston's stadium.
Ibrox's team was looking to record their first win on their course since a 1-0 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team ended up inflicting Gerrard's second loss in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the rampant Hearts, leader of the Scottish first division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half and the uninspired Rangers team never seemed to match.
With the Rangers now dropping to sixth, Livingston climbs to third, and just behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
And even more problems could arise for the Rangers after line prosecutor Calum Spence was treated for a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the visitor’s area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, used the same Livingston 11 who stole a point from Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with how his well-oiled team suffocated opponents in every move.
The Rangers may have mastered ball possession, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored as early as the two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder wasted his big opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish out towards the second beam.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was higher than belief in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been given a big quarter-hour penalty with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson turned down the Colombian's appeals.
The Rangers managed only two shots to the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingston's 34th-minute goal may have been contrary to what was expected from the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, let alone for its tenacity.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with a long-stopped ball throw from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who remained calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved into the halftime, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this trade almost had an immediate impact when the forward moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to effect the block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett passing long after long.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor held on well, defending against Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again claimed a heavy penalty when he crashed into Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: On September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old and continues to count ... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When we put these headphones on, we can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity on minerals.”
Evans: "Look, now it's really crackling!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave his name still endures.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches Immune System to “See” Harmful Cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to “see” harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory.
These cells, which can “see” a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2. These cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancers," including those of the breast, ovary, lungs and also the colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach that involves removing immune cells from patients and “teaching them” to attack cancer cells worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe of support for Trump wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would run in the 2020 presidential election.
After performing his song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he started a showdown against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I talk to a white man and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star trotted out Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's bravado scene was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to prank West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had spent a bad time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They intimidated me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see marginalization?", saying that "I would put on my superman cover, because that means no one tells me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments provoked public outcry and the SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with someone on the show telling the newspaper, "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with performing the song I Love It disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a rally of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: “To one of our most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR CONFERNING THE TURBUS.”
However, talk show host Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying that West was simply “being what it is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying your music or supporting your ‘art’) who I believe is welcoming and propagating ideologies harmful to the community.
He's free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "the one to be previously known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg once used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Allegation of attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public prosecutor.
War of Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, War of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, stating that such on-screen roles often make boys feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old War of the Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, admitted that he has a "pretty strong position" on approaching the problem.
“I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they are growing up in terms of the problem we are seeing now?"
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he said, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequels or sequels of the War of the Thrones when the series ends next summer, noting that, for him, the "battlefields and horses" are over.
Starting in November, Kit will participate in a reissue of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the War of the Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple made the knot in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie’s family’s estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual annual variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that because of the country’s conservative values, 70 to 90 percent of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases derive from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information about Republican senators by a collaborator and attacks “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three U.S. Senate members on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the charges were being promoted by opinion leaders and “ultra-right” websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a tweet.
The information allegedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with Waters’s office and published the data of a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
“This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by virtue of these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew online criticism, including those of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot be angry.
You can't take a defiant stance.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
It must reveal calm and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will contest Waters’ place in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "competent authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
“We ensure that the culprits will be revealed and will be legally held responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English's Criticism of Back to Attack - Weak Spy Movie Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and this seems to apply in fact to the new edition in the Johnny English comedy and action film series, started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satisfaction about being so bad the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his blurred eyes and an overly elastic expression got his license to create confusion, renewed a second time - with his name signaling, more than anything, that it is a comprehensive comic creation aimed at non-English-speaking moviegoers.
He is, of course, the idiotic secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a hint of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the movie "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character originally relies on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in the TV commercials for the Barclaycard, who left chaos in his wake.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a chime noise against the helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for comedy is evident, but the humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially given that editions of “serious” movies like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We get the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie numbers in Bean’s character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the dismay of the service agent, a woefully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicted figure, already suffering a total breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for large flights.
Her secret service advisers inform her that once all the agents in the asset have been compromised, she will have to get someone out of retirement.
And this someone is the messy Johnny English, now working as a teacher at a fancy school, but giving unofficial classes on how to be an undercover spy: here are some interesting numbers, as English offers us a spy academy in the style of the "Rock School" movie.
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his suffering assistant Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander, a fuzzy character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, the Batman and Robin catastrophe in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously bewitched by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd misdeeds: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a showy French restaurant, create confusion by penetrating the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of the house of Volta.
All stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but as nice and stormy as it is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And as in the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Labour denies they are spawning a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day work week, but with five days’ pay.
Reports suggest that the party wants employers to pass on savings with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, granting them a day off extra.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the paycheck.
Sources say the idea "would fit" into the party's economic program, which reorients the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day work week won the approval of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: “We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an adjusted aspiration to the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not currently favoured by the Labour Party as a whole.
A party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it."
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the party’s conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the “faceless directors” and “speculators” of basic services companies.
Their plans also include the non-recovery of the entire shareholding of the current shareholders of water companies, since the Labour Party may make “deductions” based on the perception of illicit conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to put workers on the company’s boards of directors and create Inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the private companies’ share to employees, who will be able to pocket annual dividends that can amount to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when I was going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this allegation came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immovable.
“I am determined as to Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive indictment would be necessary,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything changing again.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars who will perform on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people on the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to attend performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) viewers had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful ways that contribute to raising awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading them to demand action, or is this just another case of “clickitivism” – do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion related to them already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential”, which promised to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end undernutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions of pressure on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the site’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responds: “It’s been a long and tortuous road – sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use navy as "blockade" to put a hindrance to Russia's energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
“If necessary,” Washington could turn to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, particularly where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has the ability, with its navy, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to blockade to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In his speech, he went on to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, saying they are effectively the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less leveraging and replacing fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick magician” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inadequate” Nord Stream pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream pipeline aims to double existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic motives, an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “deeply analyze” the possibility of running for president in 2020, said the Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “deeply analyze” the possibility of running for president following the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the ultimate culprit,” he said.
“After November 6th, I will thoroughly consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s own constituents are not of the opinion that she should run for president in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk/Boston Globe University.
32% support your candidacy.
The poll revealed superior support for a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated regarding a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is going through, what’s going through after he’s come back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds with which our soldiers actually come back,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and said his son and other veterans "return a little different, come back hardened, come back inquiring if there is such respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other members of the armed forces, have given to the country."
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of a gun while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district sent a statement amicus curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy was not disclosed.
The person claimed that her partner and her children, members of a violent gang, abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
Public prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Resources Council that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle,” the amicus curiae statement reads.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that police’s ban on the entry of immigrants negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “make available the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion," Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in time trial to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, 35, the mother of a feverish male baby, as she comforted him in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
Hundreds were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured his ribs and shoulder, rested outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated abroad due to strong aftershocks that continued.
His eyes were drenched in tears as he recounted how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, but then, silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Intimidation’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s most-drawn newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in Nov. 6 elections for Congress, an accusation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the beginning of what U.S. officials, in statements to Reuters, have designated as a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides apply vague tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press.”
“With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s cherished tradition of freedom of expression and the press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
“In contrast, in the booths here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have of the worrying economic trajectory of their country, as the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
In addition, he added that “one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish” his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many prominent Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts warn that this could spark a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward to a vote.
These things don’t go backwards,” I gave to The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that last-minute pressure from Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation is enough to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is at the door!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby, as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, MIC reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will break all records,” Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no party affiliation, told the news website.
“People say it’s already high; it’s true.
But it may be even higher, particularly among undecided voters in suburban areas and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, while not liking the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge, it’s also about how Republicans handled the issue and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the former.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh had likely or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford’s allegations, as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford said under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually molested her as an alcoholic when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals when the two were attending a party during the time they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the underlying intent of Inrupt is to “master the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data warehouse,” or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is solely up to the user to decide on who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all of their business models are turned upside down overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Bernard Vann: Tribute to the Victoria Cross-decorated clergyman in the First World War
The only clergyman in the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant was honored in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on 29 September 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the event that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire from portable weapons and machine guns".
He then ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest of courage", led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and shooting down three detachment soldiers.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s acts were “something I know I could never match, but also a lesson in humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a genuine hero is to be demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts waking up all night to watch Bellator 206 instead watch Nut Peppa
Imagine this: he stays up all night to see the star-studded Bellator 206, and in the end is prevented from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 fights, with six from the main group, and was airing live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the showdown, viewers in the UK were stunned when coverage switched to Peppa Nut.
Some were unimpressed after being awake until dawn especially for combat.
A fan on Twitter described the move to children's cartoons as "some kind of bad-tasting joke".
“Government regulations say the content isn’t suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to other programming,” Dave Schwartz, a marketing and communications administrator, said when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa nut," yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said the company would rectify the broadcast schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock Sunday morning there and we won’t be able to resolve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday British time.
But we're working on it.
I’m not lying when I say that when the schedule changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We're trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn’t: it was a government problem.
I promise next time it won't happen.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and we exaggerated.
This is a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ About His Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that this gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out in favor of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The show’s longtime regular host, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a pariah on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
“To this day, this feeling of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and strength to achieve success.”
His goal was to prove he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they sooner or later discovered his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he expressed himself because he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “has caught me by surprise.”
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, though she said the age difference was never a problem.
“When we go through so much when we’re so young” — his first participation in the Olympics was at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said, it’s hard to find someone the same age who has gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son last year in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "the whole outlook" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all that mattered was ‘winning a gold medal,’” he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London games because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you’re not going to be around to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics ... there was no better feeling,” he said.
All this was also the inspiration of his first song choice - Proud, by Heather Small - with which he had identified during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Mickelson in low form on bench at Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to regain his form to prevent the milestone from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record-breaking turnout, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often been in the United States teams, the five-time winner of the men’s main championships divided the day between the role of supporter and the work on his field game, hoping to rectify what afflicts him.
Having never made the most straight strokes even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf Nacional course, where the long rough normally punishes the errant strokes.
And if the pitch alone wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, will face precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage starting all 12 singles games, get off to a good start, Mickelson’s departure may prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
“He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a respected champion who has given so much to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably didn't watch him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to proceed.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never matched the successes of your individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
“He’s sarcastic, funny and witty, likes to play with people and is an excellent person to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just playing.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows his big advantage could vanish in no time.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his loose lead on entering the last singles day in the Ryder Cup can easily become a bumpy ride.
The Danish had his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans but crossed the finish line with the narrowest nose on the margins, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but only a little bit,” said Bjorn in the picture, after watching the 2018 Tour de France win 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, do your best.
Go over there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the scoreboard.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
I’ve always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of who’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is the individual performances and that involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we’re there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message that must be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they’re going to abandon their partner and he has to go and give his best as well.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who earned three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big twists on the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing when Europe pulled the "Miracle in Medinah" from the hat.
“I remember all the words,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this impetus is directed to one side, the pressure is very great in these middle starts.
We’ve arranged our squad accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we’re going to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas, with the mission to try to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers the entire journey,” Bjorn said of his choices for the singles.
New German warship once again postponed
The latest frigate of the German navy should have entered service in 2014 to replace Cold War-time warships. However, it will have to wait until at least next year, due to faulty systems and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to have joined the navy in 2014, but disturbing post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the navy had ordered in 2007 will serve to replace the aged frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, in addition to a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenances, which would allow to send the latest frigates on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have meant that with the state-of-the-art warships, considered as a way for Germany to project power across borders, they will already be outdated when they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, returning it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a number of crucial “hardware and software flaws” that would make the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the contingent needed on the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
It was also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to install additional functionality in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached an astounding 3.1 billion euros, an increase from the 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems plaguing the most recent frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used.
The politician said the problem had grown exponentially over time as older ships were put out of service without existing vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research is underway on a property in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats, as well as long-eared browns and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations scattered throughout the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and by volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will assess the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviors on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow breeding, as well as how best to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the past century.
These animals are threatened by the construction and development work that affects the dormitories and makes the habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning are also a threat, along with fly-killing papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given your night hunting habits, your ears are more useful than your eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo tracking technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, dorm inspections, and sometimes rescues.
He also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, at the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten Scottish bat species.
The property’s director, David Thompson, says it’s the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Threate we have an excellent area for bats,” he said.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there’s still a lot about bats that we don’t know, so the work we’ve done here and on the other properties will help us know more about what they need to flourish.”
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance on the properties, as the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitory could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don’t know how their populations are avenging.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” stating that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he would then have paid $375,000 to keep the alleged victim quiet about the accident, reads Friday's Der Spiegel.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were released, Ronaldo, 33, characterized the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," the five-time Golden Ball winner told the chamber.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I’m a happy man and it’s okay,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have characterized as “an inadmissible report of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
"Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where the player raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99%" "a good guy", harmed by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she addressed the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to enter into an out-of-court settlement because she felt “terrified by the prospect of retaliation” and was concerned about the possibility of “being publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old woman now says she intends to cancel the deal as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain would “repent forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, Secretary of Business Greg Clark said.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU disorderly at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would shut down its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-built cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border, which the sector says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s “Chequers Plan” for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also our taking advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points to the fact that we absolutely need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Although it could not give an estimate of downtime, Toyota said that in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and could sooner or later lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union there, said its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” given there is still no understanding as to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the President.
Trump’s ability to prepare for the deputy attorney general’s dismissal, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of covertly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House, with reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not to fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying a final vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, it may be this week but it may also be postponed another week, in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with such a statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they like the lead."
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president has more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, adding, without adding evidence: “We looked at these numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this often and they've seen that we've done it in recent weeks, and the fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way before the journalists present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at Scottish National Health Service on fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to pay for applications for resident status for EU citizens working in the country’s decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, with decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this moment how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tigers' Mike Organ said.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
"He approached the sideline and practically passed out," Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff put Abercrombie’s oxygen in the sideline before laying him on a stretcher and transporting him for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total of the season to 18 tackles.
A higher stamp tax will be levied on foreign buyers when purchasing properties in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher stamp tax on foreign buyers who purchase properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in helping the homeless.
The move will counteract the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract younger voters.
The increase in stamp duty will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp tax rate will be levied on foreign buyers who purchase properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in helping the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract younger voters, with promises to make housing more affordable and tax higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect people and businesses that are not taxed in the UK, with additional revenue boosting the government’s campaign to provide a roof for the homeless.
The surcharge – added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and lease purchases – could rise to three percent.
The Finance Ministry expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by hoarding land they don’t use, demanding that Mrs May abandon quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “disgrace of housing.”
Mr Corbyn announced an appealing set of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to evictions "without justification".
It also wants to give municipalities extended powers for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy a home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as for British resident workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning their home has become too distant, and the shame of those who sleep quietly remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old Scot has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the Northeastern club, currently ranked third in the Premier League, three points from the lead.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on their return to the Scottish First Division last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalization," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if he succeeds in managing clubs.”
Ross' predecessors as coach of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he was not afraid to succeed such established names at such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, for now, success comes down to ‘Can I bring the club back to the Premier League?’
“Given the structure and facilities of the club, their place is undoubtedly in the Premier League,” he said.
"It will not be easy to bring the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I achieve that goal."
Ross’s coaching career is only three years old, after a stint as an assistant coach for Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of demotion to the title of champion the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he has ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I’ve always seen myself more in the role of coach than in the role of player.
It seems strange because it went well, I made a living as a player and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and pressures of the position, but I feel very good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I’ve ever felt throughout my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heatwave filled British pubs but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Restaurant groups saw sales growth of 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant occupancy declined 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of CGA, who compiled the statistics, said: “The continuation of the good weather and England’s longer-than-expected World Cup career has meant that the June standard, in which pubs posted 2.8% growth in sales, was repeated in July, but restaurants experienced a setback.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the beverage-based business performed by far the best, with a year-on-year growth that more than compensated for the decline of the restaurants.
The pubs with the meal-based business also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the catering operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent over the month, with meals falling 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM leisure and catering analyst, said: “These results prolong the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing the sales of the out-of-home food market.
It is no surprise that catering groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is especially damaging when added to the prolongation of cost pressure.
The long, hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for operators with the meal-based business. Only time will tell if the milder temperatures we know in August will provide the much-desired relief."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launch.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry-leading sales indicator for UK pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is recognised as the industry benchmark.
One in five children hide secret social media accounts from their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — has secret social media accounts they hide from parents and teachers, a new study has found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of “fake” pages on Instagram
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account to show to parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 years old – creates accounts on social networks that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake” accounts on Instagram’s photo-sharing site.
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they have a harmless “main” account to show to parents, while simultaneously owning private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found that the teenage girl incited others to “rape her.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Board of Directors Conference (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘Voice of Athletes’ at Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected Non-Executive Director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the regulator’s annual General Assembly.
President Ian Beattie described the nomination as an excellent opportunity for sport regulators to leverage their vast international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is extremely respected across the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that Scottish athletics will have much to gain from her presence on the Board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am excited to be able to act as the voice of athletes and look forward to being able to truly contribute to helping guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, stopped being able to walk after suffering a transient ischemic stroke.
As he wrote on Twitter: “It’s been a month since I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if and to what extent he would be able to recover.
It has been a painful job but I achieved a full recovery, I relearn to walk and even do exercises of agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Milk pump ad compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A milk pump company has shared opinions online with an ad that compares mothers breastfeeding cows in milking.
To mark the launch of what is described as the “first portable silent milk pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ironic music video-inspired ad to highlight the freedom the new pump gives to mothers who pump milk.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled vacancy to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, I don't have boobs, these are my breasts."
The chorus goes on, "Bomb, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, I'm milking my girls."
However, the announcement posted on the company’s Facebook page generated controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it eases the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It is a sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen a few days after they are born.”
The Elvie extraction pump fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise an extraction bomb for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone also said, "An announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, as a woman who admitted to finding the song " hilarious."
“I think the idea is brilliant.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy but it makes perfect sense.
This product is brilliant," one of the women wrote.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at the workplace) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who pump milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies and even leave the house while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between the women who extract milk and the dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting it in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new pump.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Discreetly Displaced to Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has peaked, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be sponsored.
Traditionally, most “godparents” are undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective godparents and other adults who make up their households would have to register their fingerprints, the data being shared with immigration regulators.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the service detained dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The department later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of the godparents or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners with criminal records.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
Seeking to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the previous rule, according to reception center officials.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid shall be promptly deported.
The longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or attempted escape, according to reception centre staff and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as those in Tornillo, where the large size contributes to the signs of children’s disruption being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma with which many already struggle.
Syria Calls for Immediate Withdrawal of US, French and Turkish 'Occupational Forces'
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism, and that they “will be treated as such.”
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that still left millions displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to remain abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement set “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-associated Al-Nusra Front, who “will be eradicated.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, setting the stage for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the impeachment and scandals end his presidency in advance.
In what would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue from the spectators.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"This is a strong catch-all for people because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor," said of a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalls once calling a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television shows, stories from Washington could determine the future of abortion legislation, the right of immigrants to family reunion, and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it’s more than just being an informed citizen when we’re watching the sixth hour of an expert debate about Bob Woodward’s use of “deeply knowledgeable” sources in his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment full of insolence,” as the Washington Post reported) and the implications of the whimsical descriptions...
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s been doing feels like a reality show because he gives us something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s dynamic cast and the daily twists and turns of the plot (antagonizing the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
We can't miss an episode or we're left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week it was 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up at home, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He wouldn’t get off television as Brett Kavanaugh prepared to testify before the Senate Justice Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but after all they were right."

Significant external funding in the mid-term elections for the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th Circle is experiencing an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of constituencies that has left two incumbents in the race for the same spot.
The recent realignment of suburban Pittsburgh circles put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th Circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th Circle.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that old circles favored Republicans unconstitutionally.
The run for the 17th circle sparked a bitter dispute over campaign funding among the financial arms of major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested March extraordinary elections for the 18th Congressional constituency of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to the Democrats.
U.S. Considered Penalizing El Salvador for Supporting China
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners ousted the Trump Organization from management.
State Department officials decided to call the leaders of U.S. diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high rates of unemployment and homicides.
As the internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to move forward, setting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three American representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study the history
The next bomb to be dropped could be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, about which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller is allegedly guiding his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign has conspired with Russia to attack the election.
Should Congress change hands, Trump will face accountability from that body, while preparing to run again to voters and perhaps be judged by his peers.
There are many possibilities, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – or that of his European counterparts.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
Americans are currently facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says The Times news is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles at that table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how could I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game with the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers host the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive tie in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until the two-goal tie with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use that result as a springboard for higher flights.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We looked at the game with a positive mindset and got a point.
Maybe we could have won close to the end but overall, the tie was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first half but we turned around and dominated in the second half.
Thursday will be another big European night.
It will be a difficult game because they scored a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure that we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year was very tough, with all my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; training is going well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success.”
Women are losing sleep with fear of this savings-retirement account
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of the type of care they wanted to enjoy, few people spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
“People want a family member to take care of you, but they’re not having this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family to provide care if you do not let them know your wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and family, discussing where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your continued care financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover those expenses, or financing using your own savings, as long as you have those amounts available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care attorney by choosing a person you trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the establishment of a power of attorney over your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make the financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your bills will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is suffering from a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you know how to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan.”
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air pressure as he returned home after a night in the city.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was struck in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The wounds are life-threatening and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications interrupted, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status lower than that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Seismic Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, resulting in a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation wrought by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su pretrial detention center, subject to a $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself “obviously innocent,” the station reported.
Palin faces charges for three Class A offenses, meaning he could be sentenced to up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offense, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans’ associations for associating her son’s violent behavior with the post-traumatic stress of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have been cut, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the central Sulawesi region, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutors Rarely Call for Capital Punishment for New York Terrorist Attack Suspect
The New York Public Prosecutor’s Office is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city – a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an October attack on a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, running over pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious injuries, according to the notice calling for the death penalty, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder in the service of organized crime, typically used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “considerable planning and forethought,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed him as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the South Zone of New York called for the death penalty on a charge.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg couple were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favor of the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documentation, Saipov, a Uzbek national, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that Britain "would have left already" if Farage was Brexit minister.
But Mrs May’s challenge to reconcile her deeply divided coreligionists was underscored by conservatives advocating permanence, who staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been debating to maintain her compromise plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of permanence and the EU.
The allies insist it will continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to "put an end to the Plan."
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have left already,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.”
Reinforcing his opposition to the EU, he declared: "We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people changed their minds and intend to stay is totally wrong.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration, telling reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: "Only prime ministers who can keep their promises keep their jobs."
Farage said at the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are ready to betray the decision that came out of the 2016 referendum.
“This has become a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get away with it.”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud, self-governing United Kingdom.”
However, the supporters of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A crowd of activists wielded banners with the message “Conservatives against Brexit” following the group’s launch this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
“It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology ready for ‘Canada More’, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren Plans to ‘Seriously Consider’ Possible Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously weigh in on the presidential candidacy" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, co-sponsor of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that it could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump’s inauguration.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time “for women to go to Washington to correct our government’s problems and that includes a woman at the top.”
Detention in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU Tigers
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted his presence at the scene, wielding a gun, acknowledging that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-meter junior raised in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and started 10 times last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title with a win over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the pits and made Hamilton have to face the traffic at the end of the peloton, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes went to the pits one lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a fierce skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the track free, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen came off the last line of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, changing tyres too late, which would allow him to be quick in the final part, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He ended up coming to the pits on the 44th lap but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me get past him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions,” Hamilton said.
Bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she would not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, commenting instead that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are “bad, malicious and false.”
“Look at the beautiful thing that’s going on in the Senate over the last few days, look at the anger, look at how bad, malicious and fake people are,” Trump said.
“When we see the leaks and the communiqués and when they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape start from you?
Do you remember her reply, did you divulge the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn’t start from me.”
Well, wait a minute.
The escape started from us... No, it wasn’t us,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "You know what, that was bad body language.
Maybe it wasn’t her, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the charges in his favor.
“They are determined to take back power by all means.
We see evil, malice, it doesn’t matter who they can hit, who they have to step on to take power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two Giants goals against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from Friday's loss in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants took a two-goal lead from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald secured the team's victory.
It was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had made a comeback on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching for Beauvillier to increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frenzied first period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the tie to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants reached the first half in the lead, scoring their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard tied again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing the win by scoring the team’s fifth goal midway through the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, are hosting Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape quake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after dying by ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to ravage the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save themselves, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post as the control tower shook violently at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained focused to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower in the face of the imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
However, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, pointing to the country's disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, since there are many bodies buried by the debris that we have not yet been able to rescue," spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
Drinking water is lacking.
Minimarkets are being pillaged everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing against time to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces there and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
Earlier this year, Indonesia’s Lombok island was hit by earthquakes that claimed the lives of more than 550 people.
Airplane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports missing man after plane crash in lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, the Pacific, is now reporting that there is a man missing after having communicated that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had not been able to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The company said it was working with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local craft helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all with a stable clinical picture.
It is not yet known for sure what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy unanimously said the plane failed to reach the runway and landed in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming too low.
“It was the best thing that ever happened,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others had managed to crawl with the water around their waists and reach the emergency exits of the plane to sink.
He said the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors working on a quay improvement work nearby also helped in the rescue by resorting to an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, in the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded its allegations Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old defendant Quintom Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several mobile phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by claiming he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville.
Another incongruity in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicated they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin making its final submissions on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be reviewed by the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed group claims hip hop has strayed from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to go back to these roots and return the popularity to conscientious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent revival in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York City maid sues couple for firing via ‘racist’ SMS
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received an SMS from her mother complaining that she was “more of a black woman.”
The couple denied the accusations of racism, saying the trial was an act of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed some fear when she discovered that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she showed up for her first day at work in 2016.
“I CAN’T BELIEVE... MORE OF A BLACK,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she became aware of her blunder, an “embarrassed” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice on the grounds that her previous African-American nanny was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent home from Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and seeking a layoff indemnity of $350/day for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
“I want to show them that they can’t go unpunished,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical since they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t really want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to someone who had treated them badly? Even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it."
Nicknamed the extortion process, Plasco said his wife had only been a mother for two months and had to deal with “a very difficult situation.”
"Are you going to chase someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the legal process unfolds, the public opinion court was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers might not identify with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun to get to know this now, after Paddington has been so successful.”
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a small play bear to write the children's book, would not have taken it to heart if the book had been rejected, and added that the publication's 60th anniversary had a bittersweet taste given its passing last year.
About Paddington, who he described as “a very important member of our family,” he said his father was very proud of the success he had achieved.
“He was a modest man and not a person given to the gabarolice,” he said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we were proud even when the deed wasn’t ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on my phone
Shortly after landing, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“So Nad called and said she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medicines the doctors had given him to keep the heart working were slowly failing and coming out of his system.
He had been dead for some time and all his organs had stopped.
I had to stand there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to restrain myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers who were not aware of the ordeal she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I always cried with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt enormous compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning Women Post Bridge Cards to Prevent Suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to have to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, a Lydney resident, said the son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it lit up the room.”
However, he gave up work before he died because he had "dived into darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, “I’m always worried about a possible repercussion.”
Sharon Davis created the postcards "so that they know that there are people who are available to help and who they can talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't shut yourselves up, you have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after her mother-in-law’s death.
“I didn’t say I was sad or depressed,” he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a rag. When the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "It destroys a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future at stake with FBI investigation
“I thought that by doing the same as I had asked for — an investigation with definite time and scope — we could be more united,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “crashing apart” in the face of a ingrained partisan standoff.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is merely a temporary matter.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, Republicans have poor results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Supreme Court frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote and confirm his place on the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors declines during Kim's rule
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un rose to power seven years ago.
Citing data from South Korea’s Ministry of Unification, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 desertions last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people smugglers demanded more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean defectors.
Seoul has reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants and not refugees, and they are often repatriated.
Relations between North and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss denuclearization negotiations that are at a standstill.
The talks followed a landmark meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed broadly to collaborate on the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
“Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and in these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve on Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse legacies to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotional opening statement, sometimes in a shrill, sobbing voice, as he spoke about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly accused the committee’s Democrats, dubbing the allegations made against him of “murder of a grotesque and conspiratorial character” organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton having lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves she is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court given her prejudiced behavior against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
When asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's effective appointment and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don’t qualify to be on the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the District Court of D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he feared potential Kavanaugh's views against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs. Wade case, given he enjoys the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh outlined questions about the possibility of revoking certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision,” Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control their emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and you can't vent without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
A woman in an executive position at any company helped me a lot. She told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she had created a technique. When she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person I was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it went on.
And I thought to myself... it’s brilliant,” Ms. Steinem continued.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misunderstood.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job in a male-dominated office where I cried with inexpressible rage, being grabbed by the neck by an older woman - an unfriendly manager who terrified me a little - and literally dragged up the stairs to hear her say it.
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be pleased they’ve managed to affect you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught up in an extramarital relationship aboard a ship called Monkey Business and gave up the nomination, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who dubbed the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given his late entry, the fundraising was below desirable and he swore he would only enter the race if he could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, although they had given $1000 to male candidates.
“Do you think I’m entitled to a discount?” he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top — gratitude for the people who had supported it, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and getting the message out to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism — and tears came.
“It even seemed like she was depressed,” Patricia Schroeder recalled when talking about the reaction of the media.
“I would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
What would you write in my epitaph?
“Did she cry?”
How the trade war between the U.S. and China may be beneficial to Beijing
The first salvo of the trade war between the U.S. and China has been deafening, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the perspective of experts, the withdrawal of the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week saw a significant worsening of the situation with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, actually taxing half of all goods shipped by China to the U.S.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 percent to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the U.S., and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to falter in the near future.
Making Washington back down would mean succumbing to demands, but showing public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. could sustain China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“In reality, the fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Prepares for Return of Refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the revolt.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time they won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is once again crowned victorious after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn hit the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties almost the entire tournament, threw the starting tee into the water in hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter in what may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the most awarded European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“It’s not my habit to cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I’m happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
Speak to fellow countryman Jon Rham, who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe how proud I am to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles won and just beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the rest of the U.S. National Team struggled to make it to the fairway.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear in Europe.
We gave it a fight.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like a lot of these 12 players and I’m proud to be their captain.
