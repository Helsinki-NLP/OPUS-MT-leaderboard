This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely held theory, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to the scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the dinosaur’s plumage does not have the basic structure, the so-called spine, but instead has other typical features of feathers, beards and beards, the researchers concluded that the spine is likely the result of evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature adjustment or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult plumage and not the chick duvet.
According to the researchers, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals a plumage of an adult specimen and not that of a chick.

The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction force on Earth that generates tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to infer that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that “normal” matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

The infrared images show thermal oscillations between day and night, demonstrating that they are probably caves.
During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) team of astrogeologists and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: “Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground.”
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet indicating the chosen candidate.
After the verification of his identity by the officials, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a rather strict way.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that at the beginning of the vote there are no envelopes and that no envelopes are inserted other than those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send their representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict control, in accordance with the specific procedures.

Uka's weapon did not explode when it was aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, he is blind from one eye, he lacks a section of skull and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two single races of the Championships.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, saw her qualify tenth in the women's group in the "sitting" category, with a combined travel time of 4:41.30, slower by 2:11.60 minutes than the first-place finisher, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower by 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of the Hungarian Gyöng.
Four women skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to retrieve the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said: “Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman and we have also found her cell phone and laptop.
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed, while rescue services were liberating the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of killing her own son.
She is being held pending trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters: Scottish courts have found the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, “Journalists who post photos or other suspicious subjects walk on a minefield.”
The Crown Office, which has general responsibility for judicial proceedings, told reporters that no new comments would be released until at least the formal indictment.
According to what leaked, the subject of the document will be the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for the control of noxious animals had to be closely monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O’Flynn, acting director of NPWS’ Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly’s fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission formed Martelly’s response to widespread protests, which began in October, that challenge the regime.
The occasional violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing mild burns to four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In its response, the ministry called Apple’s postponement of the report “absolutely regrettable.”
The Marianne earthquake was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Philippine policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
After training in obstetrics, in 1959 he went to work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, in his spare time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two “black boxes” with flight records.
Even his wrestling comrades wanted to pay homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was weird like me... Maybe even more... She loves me and I'll miss her... Hopefully she's in a better place," Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented.
According to the survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal elections, people opposed to Australia’s transition to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of survey participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
In contrast to the survey, 29 percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but he blamed several ailments that led to doubts about his fitness.
He couldn’t take the drugs needed to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, which is matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand how planets are formed and in particular how Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed his own signature on a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, the speculations are nothing more than "talk and political idiocy".
A candidacy for the presidency is expected in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of outdated ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Additional transportation is not being provided and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there are no car parks or interchanges available on site.
The fears related to the absence of means of transport have revealed the possibility of having the game played behind closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird was born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from the University of Princeton, United States, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time needed for this process was much longer; this was due to the coupling between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed in any kind of shape. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to form a thin thread, suitable to be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "miniature codes" thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the juice of red cabbage it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical analysed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been torn apart (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix together the two dried powders and then, with clean and wet hands, thread them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on their hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a running water bath with a connection to an advanced sewerage system.
In Greece, in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, remains of sewage networks have been discovered.
In ancient times toilets also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization they were sometimes placed in public toilets, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space, you need a rocket that is more than 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is to have provided us with easier and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the car and several other means of transport made their appearance.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called herds.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The herd of lions acts very similarly to the herd of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other large cats), also with regard to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a tensile force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it is more like a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find the animals to eat (prey) thanks to the smell, smelling on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots camouflage themselves with the surrounding environment and then plunge them on.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which they belong (for example if they move beyond a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island, making it difficult for them to return), they will probably find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so to become a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those needed previously.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled from them (through exhalation).
Plants process their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our homes from plants and produce clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the superpredator of his era and for this reason he feared nothing but the other Mosasaurus.
From his long jaws came more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for anyone crossing his path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it is also possible that he was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would appear familiar to us, Roman banquets also included several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a species of rodent called giro.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate while sitting in the chairs, the rich men loved to feast together while lying on one side as they ate their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, which arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods and priests sought to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an internal sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the life of the Jewish family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the northern sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who named it, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, at that time Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you’ve seen the movie “The Mystery of the Templars,” you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears reversed at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measure 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only affixed as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and allied with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action took the name "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in a certain way also defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without any relevant historical traces, and are thus not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, and Congress was the only component of it, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, for the enforcement of its acts.
It did not even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
In order to amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all the states was required, and they had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German one, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Nearly 7,000 islands are part of the Japanese (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through it soon registered the name of the island with the name of Formosa Island, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation that involved Aboriginal grain production systems and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most used film at the end of the age of analog photography.
It is still produced today and, most importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Oddly, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are the same or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often derisive rule of third parties is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point at which to position the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and customary differences.
His ubiquitous power has affected everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective: it envisaged the cessation of all essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, putting neutral ships at risk as well.
Because this tactic had prompted a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and utterances of the First World War, the nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He came to the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an Palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, among them the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and lucky to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, in itself offers a very clear picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In reality, it is not easy to find, even if you knew its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one not in ruins.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and minor temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The indication "arched up" resembles a V and the indication "arched down" resembles a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Upwards means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downwards means you should start from the brass (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards itself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while a descending arc results in a louder and stronger sound.
You can decide to add your personalized pencil directions, but keep in mind that the archeological signs you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, in the grip of terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Teresa, 11 years old and Louis Charles, 4 years old) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses, and interest on bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits that underpin American imperialism.
To understand the Templars it is necessary to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Full Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which ended by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the destiny of man is moved by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for just a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time, customs, customs, and culture related to such geography have arisen that, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved more effective than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its prestige declined, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slow pace of communication means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, as a result of the crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing enough to satisfy the food needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually of the organic type, which uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of crops.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures share individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel representative of the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who by negligence, as a result of misfortune, or as a result of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or savage. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or flight.
Other children may have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is totally raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that has taken care of it, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, much more a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of scaffolding, but so is Microsoft Office's small paperclip-shaped assistant.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, solicit and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty handling on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee them nutrition, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe that custody is a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The custody is supposed to cover all unmet necessities in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage theory and gratifications.
For example, as important motivations for the use of the Internet are suggested "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay “The President’s Speech,” Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the back and forth variability between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savanna.
In addition, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, in the end, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in a sense like savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice by using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
If you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options include consuming plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposite to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and an all-encompassing path of love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the fulcrum of Tibetan meditation. Through the depiction of various deities the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic conflicts, procedural and cultural, caused the rupture between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies of the past had become enemies; thus the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and it would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans soon proved obsolete, however, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships to transport goods is definitely the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
It has always been the task of the navies to ensure that the country safeguards its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time counteracting the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the recent examples supporting this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in Iran’s Zagros Mountains.
They began to be raised by cultures and tribes of antiquity to have milk, fleece, flesh and skin readily available.
Domestic goats were usually bred in herds left free to move on hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of pastoralism are still used today.
Already in the 16th century in England the wagonways were built.
Despite being simply made up of parallel wooden boards, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed horses to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The rails were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place, but gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron ones. In 1767 they made their appearance the first rails completely in iron.
The first means of transport that man knew were the legs. Humans began to walk in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk erect.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If instead we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and deactivate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as "The Dunlap Posters".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the assignment was given to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known Dunlap borders are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that hold them in common with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of encoded information in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and in the computer technical language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so much so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check whether there are first aid instructions for that specific poison on the label.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both killer bed bugs and bed bugs are nest-like, that is, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) has about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the odds of developing MS among females are double compared to males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or that of their child.
These couples have the option to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations allows us to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend in a decisive way on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by means of biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
The mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns to drive to work, crossing other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic comings and goings, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its conditions of stability that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transportation systems, about which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable consistency and can be represented generically mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables have been correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to stand out from the sky. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects are benefited by the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small pits to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't feel like the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
20% of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and flows into the waters of thousands of minor tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of the size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanting by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These in fact resemble more the four states of matter, that is (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could get into the point at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and increasingly less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something new arrives.
The principle that energy is required to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission bomb.
Basically it's like rolling a heavy trolley on a hill, so by further dividing the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to rupture in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the rise of lava to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and push them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager transforms into a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the entire operation of the team and make it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates dissension between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Members of the virtual team often have the function of a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place depending on the various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
An invisible team is defined as the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the will to face the long process leading to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement organizational learning concepts can be innovation.
When you can use all available resources effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order for an organization to define itself as innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The area of research becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists’ research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before observed.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computing that deals with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research on AI includes building machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from customers, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is today often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into several software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see artifacts from museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by poorly curated grammar and spelling, but usually the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them". The need to nurture the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students’ learning well beyond the normal school day.
Proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s suggestive, bilingual capital, full of art galleries and museums that tell the country’s past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoilt beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the views of foreigners.
The vast northernmost areas are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wilderness.
If you make a comparison of the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxury seaside resorts, are mostly independent or associated nations with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travellers: it is recommended that all women declare that they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider a nuisance, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of the White House, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then named Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their trading bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of hardware, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's roads, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to document yourself well before making any visits outside Goma, so as to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see Africa’s mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motorcycle) to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuct<0xC3><0xB9>" has ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World" she was one of the main stops.
With its more Arabish than African touch, the city stands out from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located to the northeast of South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, to the north border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides food for a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are provided for conservation and entry to the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is for many tourists the main destination.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong’s skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart, even more noticeable because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront in front.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development has focused on the densely populated reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the place the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you’re looking for testimonies of this land’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal belt of mangroves in the world. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland to Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of forest included in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps: there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third are swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, with an estimated 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to get to nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a broken bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two trusses have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge is expected to be fully operational.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were seminomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, who lived on hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its indigenous peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the polo fields of Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands have their own official currency, the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands. In Stanley you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that they will not accept credit cards on the outlying islands, although UK and US currencies may be accepted. Check with owners in advance to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change the money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30<0xC2><0xB0>C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a lower temperature than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the sight of man, the fauna is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not maintaining an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals an adequate space as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port occurred the sadly known naval stalemate of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide range of shops. You can swim safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You may have a lot of French wines, but Australian and New Zealand ones might face the journey better.
The tap water of the place is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the 'flat white' coffee is born from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is the black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the reef and injuries to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack the man. Most sharks fear him and tend to keep themselves at a distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not actively living in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even combined flight + hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most of the participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and win a space near the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those most exposed.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa waiver (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything possible to increase the time and money spent by their guests as much as possible. Typically, there are no windows, no clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the mood of the guests high to make them hold back.
Alcoholic beverages are offered from the house in some places, however, the state of intoxication alters the judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as you do on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in no time so much snow can fall that you get stuck.
Precipitation and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle’s windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the center of the holiday of many visitors.
In its popular usage, the term safari refers to trips made by land, especially in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get good vision.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and therefore you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walking", "hiking safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, the first being held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary among themselves, however most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, as of the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The cost of most event tickets is expected to be between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, while regular tickets will cost around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can make drying easier. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try with a hairdryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is advisable to consider the purchase of water packaged inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to purchase tax- and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most challenging driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas among the vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes wide open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, the coverage level of the mobile phone service in this area is much higher than that found in other stretches of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small sweets but rich in flavor, can focus on what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be both "dry" and "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is normally used for curries in inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally denotes foods originating from the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially the Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the knight's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They ensure greater stability to the rider but may present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet will be stuck there.
If a jockey is stunned by a horse but has a foot stuck in the bracket, he could be dragged by the escaping horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that you can take.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially the British ones, have inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when, in case of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs are located.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continually trace new paths on its walls, potentially endless.
Skiing and snowboarding are very popular and involve sliding on the snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also referred to as "ski bumps", who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first cave paintings with the depiction of humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or trekking on skis.
It is connected, even if it does not usually include them, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require skis and boots much stiffer.
Think of the ski slope as a route similar to that of hiking.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover distances somewhat longer than those covered by walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on the beaten track.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can usually go from one border to the other without having to pass passport checks again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider such an object to be at least 100 years old.
The definition presents geographical differences with respect to the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of livelihood for the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi and the culture on which this trade rests is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all S<0xC3><0xA1>mi were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding; some lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as work animals.
Today many S<0xC3><0xA1>mi perform modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in S<0xC3><0xA1>pmi, the territory of the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued for the destination you will visit, there may be consequences to your travel health insurance or your insurance in case of travel cancellation.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are simply a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social inconvenience or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in all parts of the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, above-normal rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, marine trumpets and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather events of high intensity include storms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered as a war zone must support vocational training.
Searching the Internet for 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A normal course lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while few publications deal with war zones.
Travelers who are planning to undergo sex-change surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid return travel documents with them.
The intention of governments to issue passports without gender information (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Security inspections have also become much more scrupulous in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass controls without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Rising currents consist of the return flow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue in an attempt to swim against the current, which may prove impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, going back to swimming will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to find an area where you don’t risk being trapped again, or consider whether to wait for rescue, based on your abilities and whether you’ve been spotted.
The return shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being a shorter "honeymoon" phase), it lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes have difficulty re-adapting to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the uses of your home culture.
In the first experience abroad, you are likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were necessary even for those who return home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is the most interesting thing there is in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; on the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water from the origin to a magnificent natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reemerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, because to call you have to be outdoors with the view clear to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure craft, including pleasure craft, as well as missions that require remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly common among neo-graduates, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon returning to your home country.
Usually enrolling in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is the national pastime of Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa (starting in 2009) will not be required for the descent to land using the on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, also the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can scare people of all ages and any condition, especially if they have never flown before or had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar to the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on what is unknown, or not having control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would take days for unloading and customs.
The only way to make it arrive faster would be to ship it as checked baggage. And this is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or business class the most obvious way is to pay a good amount for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do it).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for business trips and up to eleven times the rate for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and as a result they apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u and the local language is Romanian. However Russian is also widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian-Orthodox one.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transport crossroads.
The ancient city of Izmir is spread over a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, advanced and active shopping center.
Although the atmosphere in the city is more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with characteristic red-tile roofs, the 18th-century market and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a singular octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily accessible. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant story of its splendor written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 line bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), place of Marian apparitions celebrated all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or made to work to the death, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid misrepresenting these places by smearing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known to practically everyone.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
In the metro, ordinary announcements are only in Catalan. Any unplanned service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel good in Paris remains to behave at your best, relating as a "bén haut" (well educated) person. This will definitely facilitate your travels.
The rough exterior appearance of Parisians will quickly fade away if you show off some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in woods, mostly beech, pecci and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, different soils and altitude levels it presents a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the cedar rooster, along with several other animal species more widespread.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries make available stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will gain a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants down to their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "She", always begin with the capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a noun form makes writing quite complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are the c and the g, since their pronunciation changes according to the vowel that follows.
Also make sure to pronounce differently "r" and "rr": dear means beloved, while carriage means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and often regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and in understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language may come to the precipitous conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are obsolete and act as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden age was not a problem as it is today, they are usually placed in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge structures in remote areas where weather conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blooming was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants do their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the distance from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to tour; you can buy just about anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie canal.
In addition, they define the paths of hiking trails and bike paths very well known.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Most of the traditions related to this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition is to spend the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place to admire the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations underlying this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional Churches, a paschal vigil is often celebrated on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came to swim there, flying or floating.
As the distance from the mainland was considerable, mammals could not face the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, it will be possible to experience the polar night, when the sun remains under the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the northern lights, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners tend to be accustomed.
Office clothing normally consists of a jacket and tie or suit and is addressed to colleagues with the surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is crucial, as it places importance on the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the approval of their superiors regarding every decision, and are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
