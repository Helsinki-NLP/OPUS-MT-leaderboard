The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ stock transactions reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday’s fall when it fell to about 6%.
The decline this time is due to the fall in Wall Street stocks.
Also here is the market reaction to the result of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector.
Fall in stocks in Asia
Asian stocks suffered a dramatic fall on Tuesday, though the index eventually softened some of the losses throughout the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange’s index throughout its financial day marked almost four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movements of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The planned rescue actions in the U.S. are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world,” said Hong Kong Currency Bureau Chief Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, i.e. without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should get back together as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and pass a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan to which $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion kroner) should be dedicated.
Lawmakers, in that way, ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloody plunge and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to nearly seven percent, a similar drop in volume last recorded in 1987.
The index fell already before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the proposal of the assembly did not go ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: U.S. Government May Inject $700 Billion Into Banking
The highest representatives of Congress and government, President George W. Bush, agreed to a pact on broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
The vote will take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers sparked a gap in talks on approving the bailout plan in its form to help the U.S. financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kroner).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and have it voted on.
The plan to help the financial system will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Services and Assembly Banking Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not earlier than Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the bailout plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, there will be "disenchantment" thanks to the complex mechanisms whose aid to the market will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a great advance.
We have resolved our dissenting views on how the package of measures for market stabilization should take shape," Democrat Nancy Pelosia told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive form to the Government Fund.
It should buy unsold mortgage assets from financial companies that lead financial companies to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and should also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we’re already on it,” Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Businesses
The global financial crisis has a strong impact on the rapidly declining stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to definitively approve a deal on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors about the Asian financial market as these are the ones in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear with certainty about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, not even, if they will not stagnate at the last moment with some problem.
Lawmakers believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to earn financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage bonds whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
“We have worked everything.
The House of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is pleased with Saturday's move and that he values "the commitment of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the Armored Contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said lawmakers decided on the responsibility of the program’s money to protect taxpayers’ taxes from their losses, a easing shutdown of the planned finance plan.
The new law must also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the participating companies of the program, and creates a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it, and we’ve made great strides toward the agreement that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower monthly installment charges on debtors and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And that is why it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not so relevant, Marek said.
“Much more important is that this week the congressmen agree on their support and give it their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to get that approval is, at the moment, the most important thing,” Marek insisted.
Armed hand fighting: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are sufficient reasons for man to acquire only the reproducer.
The choice depends practically on the manner of its use and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP records no longer come out, and in terms of their quality there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music are crowded on your shelves, you’re probably dreaming, at least, of this type of record player.
This is the same with music that is on the way, that is, compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as well as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the twenty-crown flea market helmets.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also decides the battery life
Some of the best players get a lot more than just playing music and even what not even most mobile phones.
No device today is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most basic functions such as telephone, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, you have a better or worse camera and you can even navigate.
And when we consider the Smartphone and the PDAs they will also have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a small miracle since no refrigerator can make a barbecue and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the earlier the display indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy tragons.
There are few mobile phones that can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have higher performance.
Keep in mind that cheap phones will not play for more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top, they constantly call still get, for more safety, a charger for work - this applies also to the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst ones can withstand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some drives without reduction can connect the small memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music through the USB of the computer.
Most mobile phones and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a particular equipment be interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to the music as a background and you are going to listen to it every day only for a while, as in the tram, then it is enough with any mobile that plays.
Which practically gets any mobile phone.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player plays the music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and almost all the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for him the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the company Apple and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
All you have to do is visit the relevant pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service could in itself be a weighty argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is miserable and most are limited only to the themes of fleeting success of the radios.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile phone with them.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you’ll find the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be its price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited to the absence of an input for classic headphones.
The best, even when it comes to the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input. for a classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are really handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, its handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the turntables is evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account for data loss.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example, the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped only with a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, check out Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are considered among the most demanding music lovers, take advantage of the more specialized mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles of the walkman line have almost identical use as that of a standalone MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a greater capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and battery (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand mentioned more arria brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Possibly
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not going to be long before it gets here.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobile.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming rates you will probably come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS sending from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, since we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that in the Czech market there is extreme competition.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, has already said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be quite difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a marked drop in prices, which had to be reacted to by the classic operators as well.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is room for this type of operators and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, it is not necessary to look for examples too far away.
In February of this year we inform you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
After only half a year, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, besides that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low expenses - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages which however, is often countered with the offer of tighter services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half as cheap as the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to bet on a non-trivial target group.
This operator is specifically aimed at man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – he’s the operator he likes and can be trusted with,” says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as Poland could catch on in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the supply of services it is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be some virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the financial group Penta, said in a phone conversation for mobil.cz.
Indirectly he said that current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to move forward in the meetings,” said the group’s spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe better times flash.
It seems that, for unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“Right now we believe the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, a spokesman for Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2, told mobil.cz.
Of the specificity of the Czech market refer other operators.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>, in exceptional accordance with the opinion of O2, adds: “To date we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop.”
“On the T-Mobile network, it will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that it was possible to study in such a short horizon.
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this with regard to the sharing of costs and infrastructure.
We see it as the biggest contribution from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s core strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - with operators nail and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a fall in prices and thus a fall in profits.
So why facilitate entry to the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull on the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is attested by the public information accessible on the websites of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds: “Moreover, not so long ago the competitive environment in the mobile market was opened up to a fourth operator.
As far as the character of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean great requirements for him and, above all, for his services."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenderings (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position in the face of this problem.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator has been concluded.
To date, no agreement has been concluded since the offer of potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for classic operators," added Kristian Chalupa, from the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS foreign relations department, to our question.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers it is more than a consideration, other than that they must note that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Overseas where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to lower prices of mobile phone services"
Clearly, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the fall in prices are not in the interest of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Really what is dramatically shocking in this whole case is the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it is really a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at the gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
“The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding increase in responsibility in their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as are telecom regulators,” Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of conflict.
Clearly, there is a relevant market analysis carried out by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> according to which telecommunications are, from the point of view of commercial tendering, a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another view - for a virtual operator to emerge, agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators rise strikingly similarly.
The current complaints of the interested parties (influenced by the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they are faced with many similar impediments.
Carrying responsibility on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We have met with him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act was tabled recently to broaden <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s competence in the field of commercial tendering, which was not implemented, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This should be perfectly known to UOHS representatives, but it is clear that their interests lie elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one looks
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator continues to work unnoticed, since there are already a few in Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, only a part are public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a select few get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the carrier, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions at all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases such as those cited were discovered, it could be a violation of the contract conditions that could result in the end of the collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> answered the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned that they can reach thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make a not inconsiderable profit and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns us of possible problems: "the law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible so much percent of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name so they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of the carriers.
Precisely this is what should seem to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> at the very least strange.
There is also a new question for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators are turning their eyes in this type of procedure, why are they blocking the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has enough competence to discover this type of activities and if it is not going to want it should not be content with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decrease in the prices of the services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators more or less tried to protect themselves from this intrusion.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market eventually too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulators have now intervened and in none of the cases defended the operators but their customers.
Whether it was with formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator emerged and with it, more began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority passes this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot fail to be impressed that the confusion of attributions in these cases suits them.
But let us not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually gets to these lands, then the Czech mobile market is likely to start moving again.
If any of the operators allows a virtual mobile operator to enter, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we will perhaps stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the occasion of the day of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the hymn Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one a male voice and one a female voice, one with Chorus and another instrumental.
The singers are Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers this Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio already said before that it intentionally chose for the Solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, also, with the Choir to look at the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had consonance," he said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home first sounded in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl and arranged with the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "New" Hymn Sounds
Prague’s MHD takes us with the chip for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the Prague Transport Company records the date when the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
It can be purchased right now by almost one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously upload it to their chip card at the transport company’s infocenters and stalls at the Metro, Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>y<0xC5><0xA1>ka, Ka<0xC5><0x88>any Ko, Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, N<0xC3><0xAD> Hole, And<0xC4><0x8D>vice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roz<0xC3><0xAD>, Roz<0xC3><0xAD>, Roz<0xC3><0xAD>, Roz<0xC3><0xAD>, Roz<0xC3><0xAD>
The bonds can be purchased from yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce, can definitely start to forget about ticket stalls at subway stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to get a regular ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard is recharged in one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a window with trained staff that helps interested parties with online purchase and also with the reloading of the voucher purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the library, it will also be possible to reload the e-voucher on the Opencard at the vending machines in some of the metro’s foyers.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, they remind us of a ticketing machine and travelers probably have already looked at them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are now five in the city but by the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start operating tomorrow, is simple.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the ring trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the towns of Central Bohemia.
"On the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the voucher," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drapal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
Bypass buses have their reading cards mounted at the driver’s box office.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany him with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the voucher.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drapal added.
Passengers who do not travel on bypass buses and do not remember when the validity of the voucher expires can head to the vending machines where the cards are reloaded.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudetenland asked in 1945 for Smoke to be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, presumably, some groups of Sudeten Germans addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
It is the result of the letters that are kept in a particular archive and that today are stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "<0xC5><0xA0>umava land" - occupied by Hitler under the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are arriving in German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators," the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in their hearts," reads.
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the Southeast Germans presumably presupposes - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors beg in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever <0xC5><0xA0>umava under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, it will deliver us to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all contributes to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason the perpetrators cannot sign is presumably the fear of retaliation from “Czech oppressors.”
If the US president presumably doubted this idea of the <0xC5><0xA1>umavos Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the <0xC5><0xA1>umavas lands on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the US or live under its patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge we have of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some specialists paints aptly the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have guessed in the least that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was in the war, as a German from Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, enlisted in the Baltic navy.
When at the end of the war he was arrested by the British and placed in the Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
“They thought that coming home, the Czech would do them good,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, relied on the Benes decrees to be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way we could characterize the emotional Campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office promises to deter drivers from dangerous behavior at the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, film, the internet and in brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind them that before they get started, they should fasten their belts.
He wants to raise awareness, above all, of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that strike emotions.
And for this we are attested by the "blood" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written in large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that the man in a moment of despair can come to pay with his own life.
The ads will "scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises to reduce accidents and fatalities on Czech roads.
The announcements were made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
“For drivers, it’s worth the sugar and whip system.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says Na Homolce Hospital transport psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
And that is why it is necessary an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative publicity, says the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of Israel’s Provisional Government, Ehud Olmert, pronounced on the restitution of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that on Monday he appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to restore almost all (occupied) land if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“I’m sure we’ll keep some percent of this land, but we’ll have to cede to the Palestinians a similar percent [of the land of Israel] because without this there will be no peace,” he said.
He admitted that in case of restitution, East Jerusalem would also be included.
“He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to surrender a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, sacred and historical place" that is located inside the ancient city.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won’t work,” he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also voiced Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for a peace deal with Syria.
But this would also entail concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to break free to win the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran, they will have to give up their relations with Hizbullah, they will have to give up the permanent support provoked by the terrorism of Hamas, Al Qaeda and Jihad in Iraq.
Questions After the Accident: Are Hostesses on Buses Illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padua, the question arises whether the hostesses and passengers can move around the bus during the trip.
“If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is opposed to the law of road traffic,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the 22-year-old flight attendant died last week was evidently caused by the driver of the truck only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places.
However, the bus can have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the exact moment the steward delivers the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with places to walk.
If the bus is not homologated, the passenger must be seated.
The Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no place to stand, which the company’s director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, confirmed to Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was withdrawn and we reached an agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat,” he said.
The hostess does not know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even a legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term “vehicle reviewer”, whose rights and obligations are not defined,” Hanzelka added.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the road traffic department of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
“It depends on whether the bus has the homologation allowed to have walking sites.
That’s all,” he says.
Buses are divided between urban, where there are places to stand and limited top speed, intercity with places to stand with higher speed permits, and long distance buses with no places to stand, with higher speed permits, and with seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
BESIP’s Transport Safety expert, Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, sees no major problems in the movement of the steward on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Not even here is there any assurance that the turbulence will come and that the stewardess can be hit on the head.”
“However, if the bus suddenly brakes, it is obvious that the physical laws are valid.
Same as on a city bus or tram.
The safety of the hostess must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier", he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the service of hostesses.
It employs two hundred in it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the position of stewardess is risky, then I will suppress it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
It would even save expenses,” he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks stewardesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have hostesses, we’ve been against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy
In the accident of the line linking Naples, a young Pilsen flight attendant who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus without using the blinkers.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he collided with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the hostess were sold.
"These sites cannot be booked for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the family of the girl but expects the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the hostess on the bus in which for a year thirty expert members of a group of the Ministry of Transport are working.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusions.
They do not focus too much on buses, but rather on the point system, maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while driving,” says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the hostesses to be something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The hope of Dusseldorf is supported in Frankfurt
In the letter of the board of directors of the bank West LB to its collaborators there is no shortage of great words.
By merging the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank, a “central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group” can be formed, as the paper, published on Monday, puts it.
The West LB bank, breaking the ‘competition block’ with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger can be a start for further mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how the text comes to understand, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in difficult times.
Because as before, West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also of the Federal Institute for the Surveillance of Financial Services, which recently made clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the part of Frankfurt, there has been much talk about the union of such a type between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for its investment funds, and the West LB.
To tell the truth, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, let it be known that he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the board of directors of DEKA, which is now made up of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, instructed the board to begin negotiations with West LB on common business activities.
In this it could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, as they say on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen field that the name of the DEKA bank appears, which with its 3,000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs in the Frankfurt financial site.
At one point in 2003, it seemed that DEKA could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was left without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian government expressed itself against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But the idea of merging DEKA with other regional banks was always played out again.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, said he was against plans to coexist with his bank.
Independently of that it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
When the Bavarian parliament elections are due to pass, the union of BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to increase, Helaba will lack partners to do that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it has excelled much better from the financial crisis than did the Stuttgart and Munich real estate.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband of Hesse-Thüringen, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, earlier this year avoided coexistence plans with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB is left.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June, Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the bank’s board of directors it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As you can match the coexistence between singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that is going to show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena attends him as his girlfriend, and that’s why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants what bass sounds it can produce in its throat.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses leave, <0x60> direction Munich, the beer party', expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag the South Americans are singing, they had already started celebrating at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-colored temples, owns these buses.
For five years they have been coming to the Oktoberfest, taking into account that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the road there, during the day on the meadow, at 22.30 turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to Bavarian purity law, sickness insurance and guide in German – Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the motorway with the address "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates take another break on Highway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 am in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to it in Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When the doors of the tent of the campaign are opened, that means to leave!” shouts Marco in the early hours of the morning.
"March!" March and occupy the back sites in the tent of the campaign.
“Don’t take the front seats, because we’re going to block, and everyone in yellow hats doesn’t sit on the same bench, scattered all over the space!”
A liter of beer, roar Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he gets out of his place, he'll be busy already!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone goes to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow hats on the trees, traffic signs and even on a poster of the elections of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There is no exact data on the number of people; it is about 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven policemen from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, ahead of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favourite tent of the Italians' campaign is so called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück said last week.
That's good, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by the critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate financier, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to be able to resist market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to pay interest.
The money comes as from private banks also from those under public law.
The cause of this is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a short period – which now, due to mistrust in markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank’s capital reserve in cash fell by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the equity share lagged slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continued financial investment income and net profit from financial operations fell to zero, imputation income for debtors and some securities also those of the dissolution of credit business provisions tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues of the reimbursements of the expenses of compensation of the restructuring of the former group Depfa as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the organized businesses for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance could have a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financier was initially lost in speculations with industrial loans for real estate, which served as the reason for the foundation of the Aareal Bank.
As much money could not be made from the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) investors and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the consolidated profit and loss account of the group, it is said very imprecisely.
It is a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007 they were canceled at two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financial institution in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own the client deposits, he, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of the Defa’s credit portfolios from its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the report of the Hypo Real Estate, the bank covers with a credit the need for financing of the group for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international money markets that are now essentially not fit to operate"
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of the board of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) start from the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That’s what the bank’s shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and the weightlessness of the crisis there is no record.
It’s even conceivable that you don’t need the funding in full volume.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
It was rumored that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary salvation can not reassure at least worried people.
The stock price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts almost do not change, borrowing rates according to position on the property registry clearly tend to fall.
Most of the loans from the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are affected, and with good reason the loans with maturities exceeding 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it can start from the amortization of pensions on time.
Or something is going to happen, which no one risks imagining – the financial crisis is going to get over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial nationalization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be one reason, because creditors will spend sleepless nights, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can make the final point and use the new-account transportation of losses for future tax payments of compensation benefits on the change in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana High School, the girls started laughing: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells of Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I go by train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I just had to find my way, luckily I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not set as rigorously as in my home in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
I am also not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt from the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, dressed like this, I put myself on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because two years ago I had already started to study this language.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and waved and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my sleeves.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, cute"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone was talking at once, laughing and asking a lot of questions – at the same time it was very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the playground they all pulled out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring German pieces of bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and something like mass tofu meat.
In most cases I have no idea what like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marinated plums in salt, buff!
In Japanese schools, benthos are not simply lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of being able to get to know him better during a recess.
I read about it in my Manga-Comics.
I am very curious to see if I can see it here too.
“Why exactly Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year of school.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
For years, I’ve been reading sleeves.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I began to study a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a skinny by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats have feelings too.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can one control whether they, behaving in the same way as we do, feel the same?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include the questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it becomes dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, as some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to spread our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This large part is much more developed in the case of people than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to suppose that even man differs from other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is united with the language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not dependent on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it pleases, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my speeches refer to the content of the consenting experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific investigations.
One could investigate the consciousness processes of animals without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during the short-memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essential goes rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for visualization formation.
And what is the result of that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed to part of the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and above all man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature fine sensation classifications follow because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the contrary, thinks that sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and the brainstem, so Jaak Pankseep thinks, but concentrates more on the brainstem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I can’t go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that is felt in two cases as well: But how can one control whether rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, because it is afraid?
I am of the opinion that the resemblance of behavior does not yet prove the resemblance of experience.
That’s true that neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, cockroaches on the contrary don’t have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to try it for men: How can you try it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I’d rather investigate rats’ emotional behavior than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposed to be fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as long as the same is measured in rats and men.
As I do not investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward than to work permanently without results.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA president Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government views UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine's ability to organise the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is a lot to do.”
The schedule for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to carry out work at great speed," said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take their eyes off us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is “a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules,” Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were condemned because of manipulation descending to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid indignant
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about privacy – and has trouble with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan appointed her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses on Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's ex-partner: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
In an interview with American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for marriage failure: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of a marriage failure is told.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is “unheard of how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old told “New York Daily News.”
Among other things it is very "regrettable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will publicly remember the pain and the changes, all of which means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is remarried and recently fathered twins.
And so he ends his remarks by emphasizing: "However my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is okay."
Prices of airline and hotel tickets are falling
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Flight tickets and overnight stays in hotels were made again cheap - this is the result of a study by the provider of travel services and financial services of American Express.
The company has analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a large change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays at many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of Europe’s 48 different cities rose on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause that “the interests of American tourists in traveling declined.”
The decline in hotel prices is also noticeable much more in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus break a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Because of the rise in kerosene prices, Economy Class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights were even more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for Economy Class airline tickets, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half of the year they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the price change is on the one hand the rise of the weak economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the airline travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the U.S. and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With one goal and simple methods the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still does not go out to make the eleventh goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened, he could read it clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
“We need a second goal,” Hermann Rieger whistled at the cockpit entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was for nearly three decades an HSV physiotherapist, enjoying a very high reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded and raised his fingers as a nod.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg’s head coach.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not realized.
“Not everything was pleasant to see today,” added Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg have to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his header; and also the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty win," he said, summarizing Martin Jol.
On Monday, the Hamburg SV will be 121 years old.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to interpret it,” said Marcell Jansen.
It predicts that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the league's vehementity than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late forced players such as Brazilians Neves and Silva, the scorer Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team can not shine with their successes.
“We need more of the feeling and the dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the Voting Defeat
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the bailout of the banks dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest point loss for a day in its history.
The Dow Jones recovered a bit.
At around 8:30 p.m., one of the world’s largest stock exchange barometers listed a 5 percent deficit at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and stood at 1,548 points.
At this time the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express which lost nearly 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of nearly 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
The shares of Goldmann Sachs Bank were down nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The bailout plan envisages making available resources to buy so-called "rotten" mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid suddenly if not step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial associations that during course development may be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state cashier.
Stock prices in Europe and the U.S. continue to fall
The billion-dollar aid for banks in Europe and the U.S. does not reassure investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate drops and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the state-projected bailout of the financial market, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite salvage actions on the part of the federal government and private banks, the stock of the Munich real estate financier for a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and traded a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
Financial markets around the world have fallen.
The opening of the Wall Street Day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the $700 billion bailout package from the U.S. government is not enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the salvation bill, the Senate vote may be October 1.
Also the other European balls knew only one trend: at the beginning the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s main Nikkei after-profit index fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75.
After the announcement of the capital increase Arcandor’s shares lost in the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the stakes in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity may not be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent nearly 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens you with a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example of the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun probe Ulysses.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles don’t behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather, they frequent irregularities of speed.
Suddenly the probes have more or less speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity which describes the attraction force of matter by the curvature of space may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what was left of the astronomers in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be dark matter that may also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known about the existence of dark matter for only ten years.
Supposedly it possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter makes up at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As Italy’s foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The kidnappers in Sudan had demanded millions from the ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the bailout have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper reports on the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently released.
The same news reports state-run Egyptian television, Arab TV station Al-Arabija and Italian media.
After news of the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
"We now control his health status," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are fine and are in security, state Egyptian television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting prior to the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
“The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and detained two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the ransom in the amount of six million euros; the money had to hand over the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Father-in-law abuse "leads to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an inquisitive study, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After her divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Ms. Rande had said about her, who having been a great surfer and cyclist, now seemed “emotionally dead,” as if she had “given up life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrace Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself in a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes by saying, “I used to tie her up and vent her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise, "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a frightening experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, it’s that if she hadn’t done it, the issue probably wouldn’t have ended in court.”
"I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An Officer Charged With Data Loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defense, abandoned two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to police.
It is surely the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the British administration.
“They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that refers to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price tag of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 following the rescue/rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The general director of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humiliating" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the 14-trillion-dollar loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley’s mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest that accrues in the meantime is supposed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and the mediation companies had to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover <0xC2><0xA3>81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Trade Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were far less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a relevant price,” Cole added.
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which can be almost twice as much.
With mutual building societies being organizations and having no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest rates on their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre
People on the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence a liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pence in February and following research carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves if they want to apply the price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His advocates said the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several corruption allegations against him.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s military-backed government first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is unclear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court’s order.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request for bail on the grounds that he could not obtain bail because he was already on probation abroad,” his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
“We will appeal against the Supreme Court’s order.”
Her supporters argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after Oct. 17, an Awami League leader said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed Provisional Government took power but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for the polio campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have failed to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials as they carried out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision that forced the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Appeals for Competition that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests impede competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of the stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All of them, including Virgin CEO Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom, opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the forcing to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New Investigation into the Assumption of U.S. Lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the action by administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Procurator General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Serious allegations of potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved,” Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for underperformance.
But it was later learned that lawyers had not rated themselves worse than their colleagues, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on prosecuting some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
They may be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the redundancies, resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is highly critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and underlines how he had a “primary responsibility” for the dismissals, which he “abdicated” from his leadership position and was “remarkably uncollaborative” in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's Epic of Much Honor
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said getting this recognition would be "an honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are leading the nominations for this year’s awards and making the rankings of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, “There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal ability such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell remained in the charts for about nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents, find it difficult to pinpoint the location of Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little street, roughly 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alleyway more than one active track.
There's no sign.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
who wants to repaint Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-time neighbors who commented that they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block’s past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the city’s Housing, Preservation and Development Department, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At this month’s Land Use Community Committee meeting, Avalon agency representatives outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Community District Manager Susan Stetzer said.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms.
“We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month’s meeting.
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area,” he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was the city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colourful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the establishment's photograph on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The setting was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of trash, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the East Village bourgeoisization, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest ones, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a sliver of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremy Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk on the city's history of Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead-end alley, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and shutters, with week-old newspapers blown along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stopped near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested it could be cleaned up.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet, and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidate positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a longtime associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a difficult business.
Barack Obama’s education proposals are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “bilingual transition education” for English-students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in overriding the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income families:
More than a third of students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively assessed in the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally astounding 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama favored.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, the school’s focus for English instruction to students is on “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We’ve had extraordinary successes with students like this last one coming in from Mexico and that if you walked into the classroom 12 months later you wouldn’t be able to pick up what it was.”
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate by other schools with large populations of Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubts about the answer, but the idea of his party’s politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been proponents of bilingual education) and their very constant support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr. Obama’s response.
While it is that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider models of education that work well, rather than scorn or trivialize them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that the U.S. bailout for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil shares fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in early morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the Wall Street financial crisis and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After hitting a high of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before retreating once again due to huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the latest episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, over the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout “seem to have failed to rekindle market sentiment.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate will become increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Analysts at the bank have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption drops due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for oil and gas price reduction is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
After spending the last eight seasons, longer than anyone else in the Jets uniform, playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he saw things unfold in the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned an unscored game into a deflating game.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazy under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players took a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of these when a cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps going to Coles.
"He's a player's devil.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people might think.”
While Favre and Coles were at the dam, the Cardinals' defense mistreat quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was fouled by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets regained the ball, Jay Feely kicked it 20 yards to win a definitive 34-0.
Those are the biggest points the Jets never made in a quarter.
The team's coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, and he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third quarter.
They’ve earned a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Rested Gebrselassie tops world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has proven why many consider him the greatest runner in history, beating his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After winning the well-to-do flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie broke his previous record of 2:04:26 last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the time trial race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly in hindsight - that air pollution would aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he set out to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using on average a sharp 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have converted to long distances, the marathon record has shrunk by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
It is evident that the suspension left him cool, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the Afro-Eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating his races too much, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, relying on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a runner.
This Sunday, on the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached halfway through the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after their pacemakers declined.
But shortly before three miles from the goal, Gebrselassie took one last push to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi reached third place in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, came as a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set her best-record staff in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He did an intelligent calculus race, letting a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners head off and then recovering them after 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and the trials of colored life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully black-inhabited city incorporated into Zora Neale Hurston’s country and childhood home, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: “the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guava, two schools and not a prison.”
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, Harlem’s most famous Renaissance writer.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described—making it also a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression Season Federal Writers Project—remains a place apart.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Ms. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who “knows so little about us and doesn’t know what’s being lost.”
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain wary of the outsider.
“We’re very cautious about the way our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and a member of the city’s oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a poverty level double the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black South - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that was born out of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those residing here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really began with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her profound books in dialect such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through central Florida often forgotten in the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a concrete face in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
“Out of the road on the left hand side,” he wrote, “there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write.”
She also mentions widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts Eatonville in relation to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor did not.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
“Zora described it as it was,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls Mrs. Hurston immortalized by citing men singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin continues.
But, she adds, swaying in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Ms. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorial ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a 2003 biography of Mrs. Hurston.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the labor community’s main two-lane street.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended his relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
“During that season, a group of white boys were going around town throwing oranges and everything against the people sitting next to them,” Mr. Franklin said.
“They killed a girl once, too.
They threw him into a watermelon in the car."
In a 1955 letter to Ms. Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, he "insulted rather than honored my race."
A Residents say today that school desegregation, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its youth.
“Black kids were used to being hugged — I remember this — it was used to hugging the teacher in the morning and at night,” said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
“I wasn’t hugging your teacher because he was white — there’s a cultural gap there,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with buoyant, confident and lines like: “How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston’s anonymous grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her into American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposed highway.
“The resurrected idea of the five-lane road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the city itself.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began appearing in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, you can sometimes feel like on a street from the past in a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Strangers who come in search of Eatonville's story, its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A pre-permission is required to do most interviews, and some things — such as the murals in Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field — cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that her island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw her whole race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly and mixed.
It’s a sincere civic sense that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
Here in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the honeycomb offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers monopolizing New York face daily the worst “bad office day” since the fall of 1929.
Guys for home delivery continue to resonate their metal tea carts through the sidewalks and carry muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men are still dragging between loaded apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 eccentric-printed shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers are still waiting in line for their morning take-out meal, and it remains impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on working days.
Employees still wait in line for their bagel to the carts of the sellers, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there are, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time it took for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm at my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy’s department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “trusted personal banker,” and they were in line for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they had switched them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction company), from credit unions and savings banks in their hometown whose branches only function within the state of belonging, and who claim to treat customers like their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with a $440 billion savings deposit, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The office and store workers standing in front of me, fearing another collapse, were transferring their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its distressed-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter familiarly as if complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-something uniformed janitor from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my grocery shopping.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that “I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I’m not taking any risks.”
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of Austria's far-right freedom party, and Filip Dewinter from Belgium, affiliated with the far-right Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the organisation "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs depicting mosques with a red line running through them.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but investigators think this may have happened because of an attempt to hide the real motives of hate-driven extremists against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim religious as the month of Ramadan was coming to an end.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the right turn in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that grabbed nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign centered on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party that won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against head scarves and burkas, and also voiced opposition to foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties try to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change was mainly brought about by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a travel ban Thursday after judges had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates’ Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrates’ Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travel abroad as well as to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the sex offender registry.
He has to inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary that you inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or Glitter’s possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risks that may exist to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When he was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully enforced the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A source at the Interior Ministry reported that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, was reassured and glad to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I take the master off-stage to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no ruffles, no premiere suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration in interpretation to get the relaxed look of man or woman.
Aside from the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments outside the public, when they find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of some hands, carefree because they will not go out on the scene.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser-known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the program of the Month of the Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be anyone but, on seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character within.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With the taste of the "Singing of the Mines" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of the dance, the singing or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the elf that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter a moment in their life, be it a long or short moment.
I think that within photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or confront people, characters, who sometimes you don’t even know, or who only give you a few minutes to take the photo.
In spite of these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of current flamenco under the title "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Galer<0xC3><0xAD>a El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, located at number 20 of Calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where it can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a temerity"
It takes place in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to carrying out the new project in which he works, a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and went through the Amazon.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that occupies today "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
“If I were sensible, I wouldn’t do it, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the feast of the word and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival Award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend", filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a devoted audience who was made very short the time in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, revisited how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes from "a way of being disciplined"
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more dissatisfied," so he asked the writers "not to give in to their frivolity" and "take responsibility."
The climatology diminishes the Pozoblanco fair that also runs out of bars
The festival of rejones that closed the payment of the fair of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The inclement weather has begun with this fair, since finally two of its three festivities have not been able to be celebrated.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bullfight planned.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a Castilblanco lockup.
It was only on Friday that there was a party.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante greeted his two stallions with greetings and an ear, which gave more attention than his bullfighting.
Of course, even worse was El Juli, who passed through the coso of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his second bull, after a labor of relief he won the blow of a large part of the public.
They skip a checkpoint in <0xC3><0x81>lava in a van with two thousand kilos of hash
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Officers dismiss the two occupants of a van and they begin to flee.
Its cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
The agents chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., the Interior Department of the Basque Government said in a statement.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Traffic Unit of <0xC3><0x81>lava were carrying out a transport control on the N-1, as they passed through the municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were preparing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated sharply and skipped control.
Officers began their chase until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later on the levee, at which point its two occupants hurried off to run through a forested area.
The Ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bales, so they proceeded to transfer it to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials verified that the license plate had been "doubled" since it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so the arrested has also been charged with a crime of forgery of public document.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as mentioned, and determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, 28-year-old A. A. J., was transferred to police stations to carry out the corresponding investigations and will be made available to the judiciary in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a California Highway Patrol spokesman told People magazine.
The witness detailed that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and on reversing he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Soon after, the witness, who had apparently not recognized the actress at first, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted emergency services because she was “concerned about Locklear’s life.”
When police arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so agents took her to the drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the outset, although "as officers observed at first glance, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison around 7:00 p.m. although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making favor deals with relatives.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," said Llamazares on the action that the party will have to adopt with the councilor so far in the Sevillian consistory.
However, the IU leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva may have committed: "IU has always defended that such matters have the maximum degree of transparency."
In the same vein, he stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'Blood of May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Sangre de Mayo, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in the cinemas, to become the future in a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’s literature, José Luis Garci says that he has fulfilled this filming “a childhood dream”, which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary of the 2nd of May in Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set with the appropriate decorations and costumes the portrait of "a stunned Spain that was mistaken as a leader to fight for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII ", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a funding like Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice that of Sangre de Mayo -, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes embodied in a script signed with Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Back to Start, has focused on what is his usual way of working, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting filming and those who do not cast, because it seems "humiliating" and consider that "part of the job of the director lies in going to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters who coincide with Sangre de Mayo repeat themselves before their camera, as is the case of Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
A four-time Oscar nominee - of which he won one - Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Sangre de Mayo itself, Seven tables of French billiards and the finally selected, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be made known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
“In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize you only work for prosperity, and now you’re content to make one more movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay homage to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of corsets that impeded the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was amazing.”
According to the dancer, "we do not pretend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me flamenco sticks.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested to me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" a tangos.
Their dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic,” she says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in the one of "The open door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola the character of maturity.
I’m happy that he has agreed to act in my play and I’m very honored to do so.”
The montage also features the musical composition and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, "who plays the role of the eternal accompanist of this type of artists who were divas in all their extension, and always in love."
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as all over Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have an enormous influence in a given era and now nobody knows and much less values her work,” says Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The show will begin today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega theater.
The publication of the "Diary of a newlywed poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Nobel Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a to celebrate the "Triennio Zenobia y Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" anniversary (2006-2008), organized with the Lir's object
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House Museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: Ael popo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, is planned to travel to New York.
Also, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Recensed Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America Likes It Less Without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malice," and gives the idea of the destitution of American cinema, and of all America, before the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look how hard it was for them to give him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
I knew he was very sick.
Still, it's been a hit for everyone.
“Sometimes what you feel is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better because of your existence.”
No one was afraid to make a fool of themselves or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and homeland had died in a particularly dark moment, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking motives for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire are left to you, you do not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for all an almost Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and an advocate of lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his firstborn, who died of overdose, to his brand of homemade and organic food.
A gift to a country that has struggled to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The exploding wave of admiration sweeps away Hollywood without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“He has set the bar very high for us all,” noted George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the requirement of probity and of having a serious private life and away from the cameras high.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he surely had the chances of not being so.
"But why should I eat hamburger outside the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud of him as he was of a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather, and devoted philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that an Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect race was called it, and in my opinion it has been the worst race by far I’ve been in.
A heap of nonsense, which, of course, if taken into account as an evaluation and examined by me, would be a very clear suspension.
But let’s go in parts and from the beginning.
The nonsense begins with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn’t sound bad to me, but if they already make you go give it all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here you were only made to go to collect the bib (first nonsense, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the t-shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small T-shirts with less fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a minutiae compared to those on race day.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race started and we had not yet left the backpack, although once we got there, the pickup was worse.
In addition, the rain lightened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by conates of popular rebellion and assault on the booth.
I think that about 500 people will surely have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear at the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not mark the exit correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it wouldn’t get into my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At MIT’s Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft showed an advance of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) attending to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they wear - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will attend to him shortly.
All without blue screen.
Awesome.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with essentials instead of loads of commercial garbage, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
All a find considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came online, I was one of those who added to the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but we must think of the “death” of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
The computer boots just to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo for this post was taken in one of Microsoft’s employee break rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
In the soft drink machine a sign asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, there was also a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather pulling to 2010.
At Microsoft they will surely look for the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is becoming more and more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will take its toll.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start to enumerate stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that strong pointed moustache who was lifting weights in a traveling circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men's cotton inner t-shirt, cinched and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the speaking Anglos call, but le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all the others.
First, by its rumbling name - although it is familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with sport because it gets its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out for its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive shield and the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic t-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
Also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for underwear comfort.
It's a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango makes in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, wins in short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we get many references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch the women how they dress, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have many bonds in common.
When I was a child, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to dig into my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know that dancers like to do our stylistics for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you are given the wardrobe is when you really find the character.
So, everything is united, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and professionalism.
You didn't turn 30 long ago, did you get into a crisis?
What's up?
I feel better than ever, I like all 30 of them.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was a child and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I am going to be a mother because my body asks for it and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give a lot of happiness to my son and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you are looking forward to several premieres that you filmed last year.
That’s right, and I’m looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it can not be.
I'm looking forward to the release of 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what they look like...
A few days ago, you made your runway debut with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went on a catwalk to be a model.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I pulled out two pieces from our collection for Mango - were auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi's tender heart.
So many things are said about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm sticking with that good part she's involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he asks me to make the pine, so too.
To benefit third world women, whatever it takes.
Drivers re-incident for alcoholemia must install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the drunk vehicle, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the Attorney General’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so he will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the Attorney General of Segurida Vial, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving again take the car.
The alcoholock would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abtes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be charged to the sanctioned.
In this sense, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing such behaviors before they result in criminal offenses.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary route, and, however, the necessary reform by criminal way requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial modality, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some commercial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative of the PSOE in which it intends to install this system on school buses, as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without peep-toes
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the scheduled time in the program, landed in the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez de Mexico DF the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced him to use his hand as a visor to watch the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of a ladder, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you can not go to the airport to charge at that time... She is from here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport stuck to the red carpet and a military fence formed by 27 marines who interpret the salvo of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, mane in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual peep-toes, perhaps she had been told that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a short stop to the photographers before moving on to the room where the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four big ones in the city, a reporter awaits them.
The award best endowed with fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than Paris and possibly no living designer more exquisite and bont vivant than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talent.
It was awarded a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango shop window at number 54 on Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one is in London.
So many events, combined with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, made us end up in a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, heartbroken and heartbroken, for the recent death of his brother, put on a suit from the House and some ELAH dressings, which cut off his breath, and from the arm of his son Louis - a cannon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentlemanly that he ended up, with the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, who came to the store with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner transformed into a black long sexy dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a hideout of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre did not stay to walk around the outbuildings of the palace, but before she showed us on the mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we were able to rejoice in the sight with the presence of Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez - another cannon that travels by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously requested, that there be no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And if that’s not enough, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine yourself shrouded in the hectic pace that today’s life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily burnout and disconnection problems with the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Regardless of the yoga positions, the classic massage or the spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called ‘1001 Ways to Relax’ and its calm will reach the bookstores at the hands of publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' disproves such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, unplug your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking in Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very smart telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk while they are asleep.
The first time it happens, you may get scared, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder called somniloquia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once in a month), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting (sleeping) or sleepwalking, but it doesn’t have to be.
As we have already mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation situations.
It is an understudied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a calm tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or the opposite (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it is advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives it out in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and find it difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will help the child to have a calmer sleep.
Once the somniloquies appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful Tips
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even though he’s talking, he’s sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes you should consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You will achieve nothing, because being asleep is not conscious enough to organize his thought.
Also you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so be very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That creates a lot of anxiety.
In short, do not worry, it is not bad, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on its field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good match, the team created many chances of goal and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn up, Romain with the toe or Diebold also came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we would not let the midfielder pass and we would leave only Riahi in attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two goal chances from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens with the goal from Marais, well placed to pick up the rejected ball in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the striker Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and it will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who went back a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a significant sizzle, the ball passed very close to the cross field.
Sarkozy finds fishermen furious
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a rodeo for Brittany.
In the face of the demonstration of resistance on the part of the fishermen who strongly disturbed last Monday the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports, the president of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to meet there their representatives.
They promised to welcome it " in a constructive spirit " and hope that " it will come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " set up by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the increase in diesel prices, which marks a record at 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president will “discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors.”
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce circulation in the Morbihan and Calvados rivers, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le have not been stopped.
" A filtering barrier " has been set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the bou stayed at the port, or Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not leave " and " do not want to move to Paris ", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the committee of fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but believe that the financial break-even point of a ship can be reached only with a diesel with a price of less than 0.30 euros per litre.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of "Two Men and a Destiny" has died of cancer, aged 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes greeted film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who has passed away at 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautical company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
Insurer American International Group, which has been pulled out of trouble by U.S. monetary authorities, is aiming to sell more than 15 percent of its assets with the goal of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to discuss possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to divest include its aerial leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times continues.
AIG must quickly liquidate to repay its $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of American authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting it by the appropriate proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic slump on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save banks: the Dow lost 6.98%, a loss never seen on the stock exchange of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq lost 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, the day on which exchanges restarted after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“That’s not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows the extent to which the market was counting on this plan,” added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would arrive “too late.”
“If the project is really dying ... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the US central bank, the N. of the Net) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further,” warned Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, " every day that passes announces the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, stressed Ms. Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing “not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis,” added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen drastically.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell by 3,632%, down from 3,827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond fell by 4,161%, down from 4,357% the day before.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House followed another to find out who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, while honorable, was not “brilliant enough” to allow him to curb his low in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama won with 39% of those polled, while 25% of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his candidacy member, Jose Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain highlighted his undisputed foreign policy experience, underscoring his adversary’s “naiveness” on these issues that were at the heart of this first face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... " he accused on several occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican TV commercials.
Obama said it represented the future.
Without disconcerting himself, he was concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"Mccain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," a Democratic television ad retorted this weekend, blaming the Republican for failing to consider the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in the rain.
He did not utter the words "middle class" or "workers." "Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is regarded by Americans as the most capable person to save the economy that is on the brink of a precipice.
“Next week could be a defining episode,” said influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic nominee, the current financial disaster “is the final consequence of eight years of poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would still cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans despite the shocks of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also pointed out that achieving eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates shunned questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted by Congress this afternoon and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, "Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of polling stations in central Minsk square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against President Alexander Lukashenko’s power: “the dictator, he has to resign”.
Some admit not to have voted: “for what, since they will do what they want with my vote,” says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has put foreign observers on the table in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to effect democratic change.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections are seen as clean for observers.
It was not according to the opposition.
"We have been placed alongside the electoral commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the counting of the votes," said Yuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
“It is a cosmetic change,” says Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former candidate of the opposition in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, “because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it is the executive power.
If some opposition deputies enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
“But his entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stresses that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) favored the manipulations.
"Have you noticed the elections? Ask the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be at most five deputies from the opposition to parliament, those who are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulated themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained the trust of the public that had been seriously faltered by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would not occur again.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of reports from Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
“In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec,” Décary recalls.
The situation was daunting.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public," he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population was now confident in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "confidence is extremely fragile".
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we institute exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had remained in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of HIV detection appeared on the market: the nucleide acid tests that allow the presence of the virus directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until now were based.
Nucleic acid tests helped shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
This substantially reduces the risk of certain donors becoming infected unknowingly and not being able to detect them.
These improvements significantly lowered the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without worries," says the head of the Héma-Québec board of directors.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
You have to be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continues before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
“The needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Since the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has an impact on the blood donor network, which on average brings together only 3 per cent of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All healthy 18-year-olds who meet the eligibility criteria may donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
Scarcity is very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since today’s life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate his blood,” grieves Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the placing on the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and it is expected to draw more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts early next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood draw program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed not to be able to enjoy this ", since Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - Impact in the semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-finals of the USL first division knockout series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in short) win at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the quarter-final series, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half with no goals from anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many chances for goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who defeated Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the round-trip game series on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the return game to take him 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semifinals 5-4.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In a nutshell – Kovalev’s winning goal
The Canadian’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn cheered the attack on a 3-2 Canadian gain on barrier free throws against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, Tricolor's fourth in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play his best in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation.”
Charest takes care of the North
The prime minister does not rule out launching elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party’s general council is over, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected during today’s by-election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern frontier": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force by staying in the main lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks that the elections will take place this fall, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The “North Plan” is the fourth side of a “vision” that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a “new economic space”, which includes an agreement on labor with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was " a jewel of immense potential " but did not give a precise term, investment amounts, or priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This “territory twice as large as France,” is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it at our home, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the flow towards gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added, having paused theatrically to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, comprises a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
“It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion presents itself, I reiterate that position on the part of the government,” he said.
In addition, “with climate change, we need to rethink our view of the North,” he said of the Northwest Passage, which will open every year due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers occupying the territory a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec party of Ungava), have already started consultations about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role began some work.
The prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting in which "a common vision" will be given.
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan “will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s coming to power in the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central to Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
“From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, to Lesage that made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa that made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future,” declared Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the program "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Turning to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
“This stays with us, but I expect to be there,” he told his militants, arousing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He stresses that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no problems in accepting: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular called for recognition of the " Quebec specificity " in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council and that they would have a right of veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcome the broad lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The leader of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, resigned to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today" commented Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
Quebec’s Democratic Action appeared to support the government’s adoption of a Plan North.
"But what you want is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Lyrics - A Disgraced Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
Thus dishonoring this woman who fought an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what she says all about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that in no way takes into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are accused of him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, renounces its promise and lets a child soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who conspires with a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order for him to enjoy the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of extortion.
We do not yet realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy”, that is the word that Harper keeps repeating and that makes no sense.
The time has come when no morals exist anymore: we can arbitrarily mistreat, torture, imprison a Canadian citizen as the hitherto minority head of government wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what it did to the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In its Sept. 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world’s largest gold company filed a six million euro defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to spark a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecutions for defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to theirs?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will muzzle the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to examine the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by clubbing.
So it was enough for the mining company to open its books, its files and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold appears not to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can call for a "public" debate by disregarding the views of the latter?
According to the vice-president, this word seems to refer only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak out.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does it mostly because it rejects the mining company’s brutal way.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a chase-jaw (pursuing " public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed an injunction with respect to the authors of Noir Canada urging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and make a debate about facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and argue about subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under pain of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he has no desire to engage in a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by the elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms that aim to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses embargoed for non-payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the leaders of the companies rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Rep. Judd Gregg at the negotiating table announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We are making great progress towards a deal that will be effective in the markets,” Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“It’s the bottom line: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption to Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” Gregg said.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect of a new failure on the mood of investors.
The last time they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential election, who have joined late in the negotiations, were rather favorable to the agreement, not forgetting however to express their displeasure at being forced to reach this extremity.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow homeowners to keep their domicile and that on the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, they are not to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
“The important points I read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we can get ahead.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable.”
The $700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unsellable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and causing a freeze of liquidity and an outflow of banks and financial institutions.
It’s a group of Republicans who had changed the first draft deal last week.
We believe that we have come out of stagnation since the Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In an effort to clean up the mess for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to bear losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would purport to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the president thinks it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote from Congress.
In return for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will earn him dividends in case of profits and that he can resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the embargo procedures concerning housing obtained from real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on the remuneration and on the cash compensation paid to the leaders of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives today and the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this bill, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that “in all evidence, Washington does not want to understand.”
“We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that’s about profiting from taxpayers.”
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is an animator for a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel Laureates, wrote to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the way forward, "he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was renouncing to buy its bankrupt competitor since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) during the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regained a voting right in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, across the English Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes were his triumph for so long.
Had the American actor with a charming smile freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity, and a talent that was evident will also have taken him away from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great cross-country runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday of lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last American film icons of the gigantic years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he closely resembled and who was long regarded as a rival in film, more prudent in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and of the outbreak of dramatic covenants.
Mixed bloods often make magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No excessive ego, last mark of quality.
Because in it a whole country was projected in love with the self-made man, the Pacific War fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This civil rights man was also the second-placed driver in the 1979 Le Mans 24 Hours, dubbed by a sex symbol, although he was a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the secret sides of this secret star, discreet and committed, allergic to the scandals of the world of entertainment that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman sparked vertigo for moviegoers this weekend, as his big roles collide on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual moving parade through it.
Many memories come to mind as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Zinc Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in the history of cinema.
This delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano in Robert Wise’s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic mangante in the sumptuous film The Sting (The Coup), Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
A bitter billiards player and avenger in Robert Rossen’s magnificent movie The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar out of nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes with the years, was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 on The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the Irish mafia's godfather in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends who left the career rather early, Newman remained long in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its luxuries and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in "underplaying" and that judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young gallant than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed sides of his true pudic sensibility not very well known.
Her 1968 film Raquel, Raquel (according to Canadian novelist Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work of shame and sadness.
“Among the numerous tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former partner in arms Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very saddened: “My life and my country were better because of their existence.”
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against Hollywood excesses.
We will have seen a lot of his face reign over the jars of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The profits from these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than contenting himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce in the invoice factory Zuschlag & Co. ?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing frauds of significant damage, in a business way, continuously and in an organized way in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor ' s Office, they used the funds obtained in public tenders for their own purposes, often justifying the fulfilment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and those of the municipalities - in total about 65 million HUF - stopped partly in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and partly in the pocket of private individuals.
The method, which was also disclosed by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with fake invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were false.
To do this they obtained the stamps in the market of the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros District and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that in the name of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour through the Upper Balaton Region to which J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag sent Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and these served as a model to prepare the invoices that they presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people do not fit in that place at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezrédért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the village of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the invoice contained one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of great fantasy invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the bookkeeping of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company's manager, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and shown the invoices, he already knew that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp our company name and NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the bill 100 people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people fit.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has not been working for some time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so on the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated a trip inside Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the agency’s practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, even though travel outside the territory of the European Union was exempt from taxes.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the employees of the hotel only issued machine-made invoices but the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "shippers" also made other mistakes, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out road transport which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecutor - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - improper format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, for XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued these invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in the process of liquidation, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
Consciously sent out invoices
Another group of manufacturers of fake invoices are those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, issued an invoice worth about HUF four million on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezrédért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Likewise, the Biogate Kft., currently in the process of liquidation, collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> singyegyegy.
There was no movement of capital either, because after they canceled the invoices prepared but forgot to record in their documents this entity.
The next group of manufacturers of fake invoices includes those who have some connection with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant for the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL based in Budapest, which dealt with the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since 14 September 2005 is in the process of liquidation.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company for the Atlasz, for the Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and for Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezrédért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian bricklayers at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually functioned because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he profited from these companies, since at the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3>.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri limited company to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3> and Szövetség to Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért presented a contest in January 2006 to T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny (TMA), a public utility of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500,000 HUF from the contest, respectively, but did not use the money for the purposes of the contest.
To keep this from being discovered, they presented the TMA with five fictitious invoices received from the Kft Works Team.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably report at trial - as they did at the prosecution - the course of forging invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not been done until the present.
The question is: what interest does he have in doing so?, for perhaps in return for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him to have Zusi assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of far superior value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of Overlaps: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University discovered the neurological-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people do not want to lose in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
The scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers played the lottery, the other participated in an auction and in the meantime the active brain areas of the people participating in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system.
In both games participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the “self-reward” mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to the scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the real value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 in prize money.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by testing the neurologists’ hypothesis, the members of the group who played “against failure” were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the “winner” group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For up to now they explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor in the faculty of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Around 500 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 receive treatment because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses in dependence on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humours (sperm, vagina humour, saliva).
Travelers are advised to protect themselves by vaccine against the A and B virus, against C there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by a poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that appear on the skin and on the white of the eyes jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, the urine dark in color and the healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year one million people die worldwide from cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most severe forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that, according to calculations, only one in ten infected people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore, it is very important to have premature recognition, systematic medical check-up.
It is much more common in three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users, and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease has a cure if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the contagion and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its goal is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less to those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also relieved the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
In the framework of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and to the same number of atheists, meanwhile they were all looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in a series of researches involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from different departments of the University.
The analysis took place as follows; they fixed a sparkling instrument to the patient’s left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and the Lady of the Ermine of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a reassuring effect.
The patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics affirmed that by looking at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "they were reassured and in their hearts there was peace."
When they looked at the religious-themed painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, as for a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases really does change our personality,” Wright said.
After these formidable results there remains only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his stature?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: it can be found both in people’s pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who parallel the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s primary goal is to gather as much personal data about its users as possible, and this is necessary in order to meet the original goals of the founders of Google: “We gather all the information in the world in one system!”
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that shook the world is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question what is going to happen in five years, Schmidt answered: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like “What to do tomorrow?” or “What would be the job that would be best for me?” – however, software will not be able to answer seemingly such simple questions until there is enough user information.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Web, the keywords searched, the IP addresses and the pages where they went at the end of the search are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-check what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic will be based Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who care about Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, yearning for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that not only do they retain, but in justifiable cases they also cede to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed over information from its website, called Orkut, to the Brazilian government to identify pedophiles.
Instead, Internet users who care about people’s rights were relieved in May when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully proved in court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution, to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government managed to get under its pretext of tightening the child protection law passed years ago, about 50,000 Web addresses and about 1,000 searchable phrases, but without getting the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy is harmed, their privacy when they start using Google services, and rebel against it as against the multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so its rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the World, no matter how much both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for its applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because geeks see with precision the very problematic relationship between people’s rights and the Internet that was produced precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional traces behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music customs, then these can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries that are stored in the Flir automatically appear.
We can know numerous cases from which it follows that for example the bride, on seeing the flow of photos the next morning of common friends, learns who spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or they can fire the employee of a company because he writes his honest opinion on his blog about the direction of the company: one thing is sure, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person's "online" life is what he shows of himself - this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of the youth of our day.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to dodge Google’s monopoly, can do it (starting with Scroogle, for example, which uses Google’s search system, but leaves no footprints).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to avoid being able to find them, but you can replace the "online" applications of Google, from the software of writing of texts to the applications of image and reading of news with alternative versions which do not connect with gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
The public expects almost openly the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the services that are introduced more and more quickly cause serious headaches not only for other developers, but also for Microsoft.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming too: for example, the top management flatly rejected employee protests after doubling the price of the company’s childcare, considered the unlimited number of employees’ food too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 the Chinese regime violated the Chinese government’s and the company’s pressure under the deal leaked all good information.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is already ready to work, what if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years will affect the world: while some believe that our previous project of scanning and archiving of books and magazines Google will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, we have other
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, can provide a good raw material for writers of works of science fiction, the Scroogled, novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man only from Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped clear the fingerprints of the perpetrator of the double murder of the city of <0xC3><0x93>zd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd who, according to a substantiated suspicion, helped erase the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the General Police of Borsod province said on Tuesday.
The young women acknowledged the crime they were charged with, and are now accused of committing the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency it is two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, which is why on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in <0xC3><0x93>zd, where he killed him and then also killed the 9-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared much earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime scene.
The police discuss the weapon and the circumstances of its use with an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers to Buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech kroner - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are held by the Polish state, which within a few months wants to sell 60 percent of the shares.
The Czech economic daily E15 reported that the supply of Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far they have offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
Under the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Bank Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The major European newspapers in their comments Tuesday dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis speak of a "Second September 11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - the Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill hurriedly made, which aims to give a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor,” which billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it’s more correct to talk about a “Second 9/11.”
According to a section of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the opinion of El Mundo, the error of the political direction of the United States was that which brought the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing more and more, and this will then have repercussions on the whole world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
This threat cannot be ignored - says the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw life belts at wobbly financial institutions, saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if as the dominoes crumble further bank, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will suffice.
It is necessary in the long term that the member states of the European Union put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that there are increasingly real concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not taken seriously the crisis that passes as a culmination of the Old Continent.
The “saviors” will not have to immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
Intelligent car mimics bumblebee flight
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the bumblebee.
In a surprising project presented at Japan’s CEATEC, bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-mimicking BR23C type car robotic steering system, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our protective safety capsule," said Kazuhhiro Doi, chief technology officer for PR and development and research.
The compound eyes of bumblebees, which are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, play an important role.
To copy the function of compound eyes, the engineers used the laser length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle’s microprocessor that immediately transforms into a manoeuvre to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot mimicking the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
“If not, the vehicle robot would not be able to react quickly enough to dodge obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotational movement and acceleration in addition to braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the processing capacity of the data, let alone the storage.
This apparatus in every second should only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No gigabyte or megabyte memory is required.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately dodge obstacles, which Nissan estimates will be able to incorporate into mass-produced models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, dodging existing obstacles in his path.
This precious child has a name.
The written version of the $700 billion bailout package law has been prepared, which will be implemented in several phases in order to buy bad loans from banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to schedule of the east coast during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, the leaders of the congress reached an agreement about the financial bailout package of 700 billion dollars in total, after several days of discussion - reported Reuters.
“We have made significant progress,” Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the U.S. Congress, said in a statement, adding that the agreement needed only to be formalized in one document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said: this program will work and be efficient but more measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy back on itself.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 a.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock markets.
On the bill called the emergency law for economic stabilization of the year 2008, the first Monday will vote on the North American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy bad credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, on this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy credit fund securities, badly rated and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new congressional decision.
According to the law the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: you can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and securities credit fund securities, in addition to other "poisonous" type credits as well.
The purchase can be made in auctions or directly - informed competent people of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying items, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated: The law thus secures the necessary financial means, which can even reach 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it," he added.
Instead, the heads of the banks that are in trouble and waiting for the help of the state will be able to count on the official limitation of their indemnities, which the American slang calls simply parachutes of gold.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of assistance provided by the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failed boss retires.
By buying bad credits directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that bosses’ compensations are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history that will be in effect a legal limitation on the revenues of CEOs, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional committee responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can even make profits from the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
Under the bill, the president will have to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how to pay back taxpayers for financial sector losses.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their reservations regarding the project.
This is not what the American citizens entrusted us with, that is, taxpayer dollars are not being protected,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were urged by the very people who are responsible for the Wall Street collapse.

Domestic sales prices of processing industry sectors rose minimally, at 0.1 percent from July.
The largest increase in price magnitude occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), primarily due to a 4.6 percent monthly increase in bags and belts and a 2.5 percent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical production branch (1.6 percent).
There was a decrease in price in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 percent), in the production of electrical machines and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 percent).

In the rest of the sectors of the processing industry, there was a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which represent a major weight in domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 percent was recorded in August, first as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices as of July 1.
In a twelve-month period comparison - in domestic sales of processing industry sectors - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2 percent was observed, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of determining weight, there was an increase of 11 percent.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile industry (2.5 percent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 percent).

The price of our national currency in one month fell by 1.7 percent against the euro and by 7.1 percent against the dollar, compared to August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Will you no longer need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before Hungarians residing there.
Virtually everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic.
At the same time he warned that in the new system the premise of entry will disappear, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin will have to register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will interview Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing her the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, assured on Sunday their support for the administration’s $700 million banking aid program, while there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon negotiations, early on Sunday announced: an agreement of principles was reached on the financial bailout package of the banks.
The financial package to solve the Wall Street crisis and thaw the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are better able than their rival to pull the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, by putting economic issues at the forefront, Obama once again gained some advantage and McCain’s advantage that he had gained after the Republicans’ convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for vice-president disappeared.
At a Detroit campaign rally on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
“We have to act now and responsibly ... employment, your savings, entire industries and the stability of the entire economy are in danger,” he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain, he explained that “we’re all going to swallow this hard ... but doing nothing is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican senator said the proposal included the establishment of a commission of control to the minister of finesse and the limitation of executive compensation, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no major role in the consultations, instead he consulted daily with the minister.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen are likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious voters became - says the Der Spiegel on the weak CSU election result in Bavaria.
Haider and his supporters are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-and-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in its article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he discusses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who are turning their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem for all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been predicted for almost ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU gained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the much-mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, the secularization, the results of education and the settlement of North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had its negative consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization also increases the possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself the most conscious, most critical and most stubborn voters became.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it was precisely the conventional groups of citizens who distanced themselves the most from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those who have high school and the graduates.
This reduced support for CSU to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper in Vienna: "Who with whom?" In its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - it deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from meddling in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open in all directions to negotiate, while the Greens still do not want to consult on the coalition.
Elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely let out any of their decks.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left open the question whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, in the post of vice-chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said the cooperation would surely not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
It is still open in the party whether they will elect the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the <0xC3><0x96>VP itself.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit for Equal Opportunity has been launched in Paris today, hosted by France, which this year is also the current President of the European Union.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to the segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Jobs, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are out of the labour market in the first place because of their low level of education.
"Most young Roma have not completed secondary education and because of the poor quality of basic education, only an insignificant part can obtain a university degree."
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a decisive role in the foundation of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise broad awareness of these issues among both Roma and non-Gypsies.
For the earlier a Roma student starts school, the more chances he will have to become an active member of the labor market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school desegregation, for this it is of fundamental importance the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be offered the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens" - demanded J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
The aim of the European Equal Opportunity Summit, organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting in the wake of the "European Year of Equal Opportunity", is to ensure a unique forum for promoting the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be made on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, so far the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, president of the party, and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party’s extraordinary congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-criticized duo hinted: they don’t cling so much to their posts.
In doing so, they sought to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organization, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago – although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career – the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the hectic coup against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria which gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the province of the South, of key importance for the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to make a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, the federal minister of agriculture, one of Huber’s possible successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that initiates negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was exploited for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly erased from the stage the ambitious local politics, enters the parliament.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber will also play an active role who has so far been pulling the strings in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor unless they are able to enhance together the CSU which played a crucial role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide her disappointment at the failure, the CSU’s losses will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which of course is relative: it will not be easier to deal with the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday’s election, there will be no opposition MPs in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexandr Lukashenko guarantees in the country, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
Although the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, consisting of one hundred and ten deputies, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before the elections yesterday the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his term after the elections of 2006 of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time diper.
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, which increasingly depends more economically on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the importation of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline that passes through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give the other regime a high level of political entry for Lukashenko.
It was a sign of détente when the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis rather on positive phenomena rather than on mistakes - such as the ban on participation imposed on a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has already considered the two regions as independent for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has started - said to our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime is afraid to allow even one opponent to enter that weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when it sees the results, rather it is trying to get its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities are putting difficulties before its distribution, but even so I see that more and more are supporting the change among the elderly too - said Milinkevich, alluding to the regime of Lukashenko, who believes that its main result is the creation of social security, do not consider it appropriate even the retired, who are officially the most.
Due to the country's indebtedness and rising trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security that "looks like the silence of cemeteries" - Milinkevich opined.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing other than testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on more breakfast before starting work"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that automatic doors were placed to control the entry and exit of personnel.
but from today it starts with this measure against who signs and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," says the minister.
“A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, says the secretary general: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on the part of them".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and crescents.
Brunetta’s words suggest, smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a convention at the School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister declares that "in three months the absences due to illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that means 60,000 more people to work in a year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and well above the rate of inflation".
For now millions of public employees have joined in opposing the Brunetta decree rules by adhering to the Codacons-backed petition.
"While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the slightest absence from work due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of 'vague workers' is continuously increasing .
There are indeed millions in Italy of the correct and productive employees of the public administration who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate norms of the decree.
In particular, the Tar will answer the exclusion of economic treatments aggregated due to illness due to service; the extension of the time slots in which medical check-ups of the sick employee are made, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicide.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of workplace accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the president of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalid by the work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"It has manifested itself, a 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the numerous initiatives promoted at school for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has emphasized "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to urgently put an end".
“The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive,” said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
We do not want this “tendency to decline” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention diminishes that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level too little is still being done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our judgment - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of the school ".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as far as it concerns the communication and the awareness of the public opinion.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship provided for victims of work" and the "assistance diversion towards which the system is heading in recent years".
"The objective is to restore to the worker the guarantee of insurance - he added - because the fate of the one who is injured does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time."
Mp3 Players Under Charge, Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to music at high volume for a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission says, which in a statement released in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risk (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
“From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high acoustic levels may unconsciously ruin their ears irretrievably,” Kuneva said.
“From the scientific evidence, a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public.
We must also re-examine the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have the step with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that causes it.
"Scientists confirm that this is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related devices."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and time of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable musical devices listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week, they exceed the current limit for maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing after a period of 5 years.
It affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives the way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will deliberate on the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Municipality and its intendant Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - tends to emphasize Alemanno - It must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the city council, can then be endorsed.
There is no leftover position of roles, only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise timeframe.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome”.
To whom the Commission accuses of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that are manifested back to back.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper prospective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
The mayor of Rome tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds squeezed by the capital".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which we absolutely need, thinking with a spirit of unity to its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited only to the current communal boundaries but will look beyond" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
A prominent American politician has written that he is interested in posing as an independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and piped relations (as he also does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a Web site: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he won the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!
In reality, they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the heart of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote we will know well to whom the American patriot will vote.
One side of the American mentality comes out covered up to the last.
“Say whatever you want, we’ll think about where to put the cross, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent it home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Likewise, Iraq for the majority has been Bush’s weak point.
Whoever assumes the position of George W will have an enormous duty to perform.
In the US, the economic collapse is felt also for journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, however, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition to the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, it is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses open a gap in the Internet, for many seen as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” journalists warn of has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope "that it will do something good" for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between those who run the newspapers — that is, the editors — and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “job security.”
The executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
“Safe work” at the staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it”.
Directors are almost always paid good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, get “ill” followed throughout the year.
It is all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in the area of the investigation into the counter pact related to the escalation Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the arrest process in his charge, last week, he obtained home release, transforming it into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate company be able to travel the route of the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million bailout launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
Yesterday’s New York Times confirms that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, pro-federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, conservative, hostile to “those in Washington” and the world of finance, strong especially in the central and southern states.
The soul, in fact, has become overbearing with the vow of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, which the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all of the West and not only here alone.
Both in the United States and in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the question or they don’t have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union which, as always, divides between the different interests and the different state strategies and fails to decide any common policy.
It is the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and, above all, the subsidization of funds: from the moment you reach the court, it is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization will ever be able to dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do more and more with the non-immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, notice, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally absolutely united in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So he who finds himself sovereign certainly has many more letters than he who is not sovereign, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but foreshadows a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation into his own hands.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of an economically relieved species inadequate with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in an increasing number.
It seems to advance more and more, in different places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the hitherto booming social elites, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have made their own time and to be stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a nutshell, subterraneanly feeds a branching but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which are manifested in an electoral “revolt” or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain to the rebellion of the Bushes.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say anything, always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what is taking shape today are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially agitates in excess.
In the face of all this, talking about a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Beat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to glue a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by gecko paws, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the reptile’s legs and at the same time “easily peels off the walls,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
“This material could be useful as a transient adhesive,” Liming Dai adds.
Layers for walking through walls exactly like the spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronics, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hairs that self-clean from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: Never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken contemporaneously with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, the efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices being packaged as fresh associated with the intake of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, which from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just put a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs, overriding the beneficial effects.
Grapefruit juice had already been charged because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological.
The same Italian drug agency had reported the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what is drunk in case you are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of the active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: "These discoveries are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us impress, clearly ask the doctor or pharmacist ", stressed the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Economic Novel by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy decisions.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 bombing, in those days that Enron was breaking, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years was reproached to the economy, but that has now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and a little annoyed at how quickly the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has faded from the public’s attention,” Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a “high-value economist”, but also a “very aggressive, particularly critical” spreader of the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, echo the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work on the part of the volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and the less rude magazine interface, more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also to the multi-function with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the dimension of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility to import the PDF file in the graphic design module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in different users, avoiding the conflicts of modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and was added to the English that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of free can be a hook for diffusion in the homes, it is in the business environment that Open Office test the suite, tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no lack of even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding of Word; Calc, is the worksheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, comes in the case of the known Access is the program that allows to work in the data base; and finally Draw the graphical module.
Target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the tour of France: the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third-placed and winner of the climber’s best T-shirt.
The news is on the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after Italian Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Analyses of Kohl's blood champions are among those carried out in recent weeks in the laboratory in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm that he is positive, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of the positive doping of Kohl to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, winning the T-shirt for the best climber.
NEW YORK TIMES IS QUESTIONED, IS ITALIA RACIST?
Italy as a country of emigration has only recently become a privileged destination for "immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is asking in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was killed the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also the country's highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest support of the Northern League.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation wanted by the Lega tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend marked both by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has called for the State and the Church to work together to combat racism".
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for college students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants’ union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to bear - explains the head of the study office of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has totally deformed the market to the point of triggering a process of generalized increase even for residents".
Apart from that in most cases the rental offers contain a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no fee limit, linked sub-rents.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of taxation, can regulate prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they ask you about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
It saves only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you are served 300/450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Policl<0xC3><0xAD>nico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed you are served 250/350 euros, at least 350 for an individual.
In smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and non-EU students is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: a 25/30% increase in the fee for foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic rooms
Historical cinemas close favoring Multiplexes.
“A city without movie theaters in a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in large Italian urban centers and also in provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono halls in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared", Observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury at Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that ever lost.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay for most are mainly the halls of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for its disappearance is the arrival of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new meticulous cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, “it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is ethically and morally shameful that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono sala both in the historic center and in the periphery.
Among the rules envisaged are mediated tax facilitation in favour of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” Giuseppe Tornatore observes, “and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna’s example by setting up other measures.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of meticons, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a subject that was always important to me: the closure of the Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
Link between politics and 'ndrangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the elections of the Municipality for those interested to the thigh Piromalli."
The accusations that the magistrates of the anti-mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the mayor and the vice mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association, are heavy.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, homonymous with the boss, already convicted of criminal mafia association and to indemnify 10 million euros.
"Despising any legal and moral norms, and of common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed willingness to pay consultations to the lawyer Piromalli.
“The mafia family would have been allowed to officially enter the municipality, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life there are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean."
Those arrested this morning are added to those of last July after police had announced the head-cutting of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always by alleged conditionings between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UdC at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call into question the deputy interior minister who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even gone so far as to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration over the interests of mafia families" emerges.
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage.
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the great ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, investigations intensified.
When the price of oil went down in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put aside, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated by 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It’s a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the U.S. continues to mine oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to conduct new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although they are not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its infancy, because marine energy has no doubts that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts like those of the Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas joined together.
The force of the waves, which causes the boas to move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure rotates a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast via submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type in development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing power for a shopping mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines on New York’s East River.
The movement of water when there are tides, rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotating motion that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electricity, deserves right now the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mainly about tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coasts, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
