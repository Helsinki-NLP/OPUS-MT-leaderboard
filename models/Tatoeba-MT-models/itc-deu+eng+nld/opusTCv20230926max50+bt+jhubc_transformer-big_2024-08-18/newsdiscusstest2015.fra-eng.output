The remaining UKIPs who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You’re talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them with barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to line up behind chronic hypochondriac intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one who's using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing crazies, practically does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a towel does not constitute evidence.
Yes, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for propagating such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity either, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's phrase was very surprising, but only because this problem is so rarely mentioned.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're going to have to be able to get over it.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don’t like it when the media talks about what you don’t like.
It is so rarely talked about because unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcher disciples who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the period of austerity will not have fixed anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland, the ''Tiger of Europe'', was boasted to us a few years ago.
We've seen the sequel!
This begins to read the article again.
They are trying to make people believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ''NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE'' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients there is nothing to '' pave'' for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the eighties of the twentieth century, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is on in view of recent events.
Lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the taxes actually paid by the multinationals.
If we believe a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only small businesses pay full price.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars all around the corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily plugs since the start of the school year.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will catch fire soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a crash on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once refitted.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers extra for the additional fear they were given?
But without that kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I flew it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can take it to heart.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair over those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic fare have only to go after themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether we will have to compensate the passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake of the airport's air traffic controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally crowds of people.
People do not come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (some, for the most part) nor for the Salon of the magazine at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners spending .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, crowded with 50% tourists.
<0x40>Aloes False!
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy duty-free.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover every year for the same reasons.
There remains the industry where expensive equipment, exploited on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed, with exceptions, by employees.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the minister in charge of the economy nor, for that matter, the minister in charge of foreign affairs, have the slightest competence to reform the labour code.
As they close it.
What is the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies that want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my City of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
And this is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life which he has steadfastly defended against fascism
the way of life which he has steadfastly defended against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter’s estate was, against his will, used to pay the inheritance fee?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not terrible.
No doubt his estate would like his share of the cake, if you pass me the phrase.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
I didn't either.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to the other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss an “agreement” with the Nazis and he very skilfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and ultimately the whole world, can thank God for having Churchill at the helm during these five years, just these five years, and nothing else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to gather the money from inheritance fees, they might even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive benefit to his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, infrastructure projects being by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they well reflect the real evil francai:s distrust of dialogue
Return to the Princips values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either solidarily we come to his aid, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who earns income from his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate between those who invest for a return at the time of retirement and those who live from their pensions.
A property to rent or even two for a couple above, it is vice
The little genius of finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of major works, but at a time of lack of large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so a new deal could not be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline is emerging in response to a recession that is only a wild and therefore brutal decline.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less severe, then the need for investments is crying: isolation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc.
Taxation that promotes high incomes and renters.
Who's in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is a real galloper.
Samsung's profits are being undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple’s mid-September introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have appealed to buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they can not be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like the design.
Some people attach no value to design, for them the options, functionality and price prevail.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a “better platform”.
Is there "a better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in the interest of all of us.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it’s not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, on the contrary, on Parisian bobos) could tell us which author(s) they fight ideas on gender and indicate to us the works they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, John, I like you, and you're a smart, educated person.
I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holopherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I do not have his vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the "background", since you are referring to it, I am not interested in this subject, and sincerely I do not see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
<0x40>John: acknowledge that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holofernes does.
Who is afraid of the world?
What are those who are afraid of?
Furasato and <0x40> give us some answers.
The first invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We can see how much these studies affect the most intimate at home.
We are obviously no longer in the debate of ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
<0x40>: I thought it was a good idea to go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the very statement made by their critics (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me very rigorous.
But well, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it is the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure if the nuance is understood.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I was satisfied with the "Second sex" (it was more of my time) which is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat compensated for the disappointment of sometimes having the sight blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud would really enclose the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear weather.
Flash special blood moon.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it back its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with it, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week with Perseid meteor showers and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm starting to think that there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne really isn’t the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn’t see the eclipse because of the clouds above Melbourne’s suburbs.
I'm going to put a TAX on this eclipse.
Anyone looking at this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like your last thought before you went to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it (forcefully) disappears?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Beautiful photo of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
There is nothing about inequality between incomes from labour and capital.
Nothing about tax evasion.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the Gardens of Babylon.
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hyperlink to the original documents so that we can make an opinion.
Go and see today, Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports are at their lowest in five years.
In Greece, the stock market is collapsing.
However, these are the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of around 8 billion euros.
The Department of the Economy tells us that these claims are unfounded.
What happens if the Ministry of Economy makes a mistake?
Will policymakers who have reaped the political benefit of the courageous attack on notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
<0x40>lol No the State is not comparable to households in terms of managing its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifetime of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it contributes to the financing of material and intangible investments that are a guarantee of tomorrow’s growth and therefore of future revenues.
Some elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of the global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands bound by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgeries, safe shooting rooms for addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money from drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Since the Liberals want our health care system to look like the U.S., you should find out how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrongly worded to blame the toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize corporate profits and “research.”
Read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare global drug prices available anywhere, as well as differences from country to country regarding what is over-the-counter or just over-the-counter.
It is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations for oncological pain, despite the laws that curb them and the expensive licenses needed.
Although some drug manufacturers may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are being used, those who arrive at a version that offers good quality products in known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for the doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a manager of this hospital.
We can't KEEP patents on the grass...
If social science “researchers” were doing research instead of politics and networking, their “work” might be used.
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
To compare is to make pedagogy not research.
One cannot say "research is completed, it must be applied" and then in the same jet "you must experiment at all costs".
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research isn't complete, why are you asking for them to be applied?
Can one explain to me how a “researcher” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they did not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator let's make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What good is it to build an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a willingness to self-promotion, a deception?
One way to train teachers: keep sophists and ideologues away from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
reread the paragraph on internships (which unfortunately is not very well argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of practices in force, and that does not allow to advance the system ".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system one cannot wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in a modern teacher training.
Theorists of education should have no place.
Practitioners should have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of problems in the education system.
To give more weight to education theorists would be to destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally messy: if I do not want to be operated on by a practitioner who has only a theoretical background, I would even less like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical background and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP in Charge of Fighting Copyright Infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty for violating copyright, all I have to do is read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement <0x3D> theft.
It is the same since they must cite their sources correctly.
Often, obtaining a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright infringement.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without the proper license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can always debate pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, but it won't be true.
This is a copyright infringement.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Obviously, you don’t mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in homework, an almost perfect definition of what a reasonable use should be, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson #1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they have passed by a click.
Maybe if they share their mp3 walker’s headphones with a buddy on the school bus, they should be evicted for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource that we are full of, the grumbler who says that everything is going wrong....
If it is a PS member who says it, then we must believe it.
I have 2 children and when they will be of age to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continuously assisting them.
I don’t want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down are speeches like yours.
<0x40>gus I have always worked in a private company.
I had the CHANCE of having worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the bad bosses I frequently meet.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he tells the horrible truth!
<0x40>gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to call for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small - What do French bosses expect to do the same??
Let the state hold their hand?
This state that they accuse of being an empire?
<0x40>Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet on your part!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
<0x40>Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who sluggishly and undermine while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From where I come from, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep afloat rather than transform.
That doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't make it.
But well, Labour is going to get us out of trouble, isn't it...
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from starting a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all of which meant that the decision was finally overturned.
And there’s better: MTR, a Hong Kong company, won Crossrail’s operating contract for 8 years.
Well Labour, as they repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
So we can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Maybe it's because the Dutch are on a good track while the British aren't.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
“She was a fighting girl.”
Lord, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beating" is a superior quality to many others, the concern for others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with that of surviving a disease: cancerous "beatings", who are no less dead, I know of them.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start again, too.
I'm not telling you that's the condition for managing, I'm telling you that it helps.
It has nothing to do with any merit!
As for the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
To insinuate, even if only for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that lets go, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
Sorry to think otherwise, if, having a solid morale makes it probably easier to accept heavy treatments and prepare for them, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not refuse them out of fear..
Someone who is struggling in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to rely on the "lord" it's something else..
Not with the right or with the courage.
These considerations are unique to moralists.
When you catch dirt, real dirt, you get stripped to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally I got two of them, dirt, fat, and if I "fighted" as these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only in clenching the teeth, suffering hell and taking the blows.
I thought the charge against Milosevic was decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What the hell is going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told at the time?
The communist-turned-nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left out: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the SMALL rule of international law?
Which country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended him, he'd be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
Westerners used a smokescreen to detach part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was promptly recognized by Western states who then lied end-to-end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we don’t like him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that works, by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to feature detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by Drake's team at the University of Marying and Fraland.
Method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat coming.
Thank you Passeur de sciences for giving us, often, of these experimental feats that are realized in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Probably by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas a priori odorless for man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable to man, but not to the measuring instruments at his disposal.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely a few hours with an earthquake, especially chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report recounting the struggle of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work that focused on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more particularly to their modification before an earthquake.
Of course I am not a scientist but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again.
If things are examined calmly and rigorously, it is published in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by animals, we will come across the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely in a circle.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to distract you with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to get elected mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just underscores how the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of crap, right?
Because it's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in “Have I Got News For You.”
Because she's a celebrity and people have been inculcated in celebrity worship.
The Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will break the ceiling I am sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be a joke.
That's exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the blinker, smarter than him
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have really and always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent of B.
Millot), the “Solomon” and the “Strait of Scrap” speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understandable that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be in the background since the Battle of Savo) do not want to return.
We actually passed the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission comes to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the green side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerozene consumed to achieve the goal totally discredits the concept.
Just browse the list of sponsors that philanthropists.
One more com operation neither done nor to do.
The cow, it makes you want too much!!!
I am looking forward to the web series!
Your story makes me revisit, identifying myself a little by the way (I have also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest bay!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep reviewing us, and proudly show that Britons are great travelers!
Pierre from Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red hat that demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a penny of our taxes on financing the dreams of some even as friendly adventurers as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation who are of Kosovan origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they are still in the team.
Bisevac is Lyon's defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or before in the 70s and 80s and coached many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he comes from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a striker in the big team of Velez, who, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also counted on the likes of Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsene Wenger's loyal teammate).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he is not a holder.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone is not the flag of today's real Albania.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give parts of the country to neighboring countries.
How can one have felt an “explosion of joy” when two towers collapse knowing that women, men and undoubted children are inside?
How???
What bothers me a little in this "testimony" is that the only fact that I could, even once, spontaneously rejoice in the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies in my eyes to a "border line" personality whose all "testimonies" should be taken with the greatest caution.
No doubt that in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
It will just be thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had succeeded in truly and apocalyptically harming the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch powerful.
It's great.
It seems that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims who were humiliated by their feelings of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classical Schadenfreude.
We had a little doubt about that.
The “Christian/White/Gaulish” West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the musuman when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today’s Arab Muslim world.
I am talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
To be understood before, it must not push back the Muslims.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose this is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet, and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of about to die.
In Britain, if you’re lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, don't make your grumpy clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to germs from the outside, that can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a fever that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, snow hazards and plenty of other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child surcharges , it is the amount collected by the State that comes essentially from the deciles 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households that have seen their taxes increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly the deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Chart 2 .
The removal of the half-part concerning especially widows is not treated at all in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros it is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And he's not ready to make up for it.
Well, we are not on the straw certainly, but dreamers
For once the PS makes a rather leftist policy we will not cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% have to bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let’s continue like this and you will encourage those 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the OCI recycled to the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from hoarding as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is to say, to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are among the richest 20%.
Probably also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth of which a part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or just lower your arms and live on social minimums, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of the Khmer Rouge head-cutters have happily lived.
I did two AirBnB in Norway recently.
It's no problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we would not have had in a 5-star hotel and we did not have to show up at the reception or face any hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone’s house, sleep there, store up behind you and go away.
This will be my first choice when I’m on the road.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowner’s insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Oh, six o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky” No, that’s not true.
You just really missed out on luck.
From the link provided in the article:
To his credit, Airbnb’s response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why is this article quoting Teman complaining that he did not receive any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I’m thinking of paying a down payment and a month’s rent all at once but I’m a little afraid of sending <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Support the troops,” the Bu$herie sang in all tones.
Weapons are harmless.
I am sure that it will please the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We're fine with that.
Do you think this is the time to weaken the army to strengthen education?
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are always at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if 35 hours were "worked" instead of 17.
Right now, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And don't be fooled into thinking that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But this is not seen since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office at the college / high school to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in short, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Besides, it is so much the shed at 5pm a week and 4 months of vacation that we do not manage to fill the CAPES of math, come, we are waiting for you.
How come you don't want to hang out with the poorly educated clairds whose parents spit on you by calling you a jerk?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Khurdi population can flourish better.
Where you can see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in selling, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a position for which a diploma was needed.
A year later, I saw an ad to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid an extra <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 a year and we weren't even applying for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
Don’t worry about it if you don’t find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well or that you like to do.
If I'd stayed in graduate jobs, I'd still be paying off my student loan
I don't like corporate work so much, so I hope to eventually move into either the public service or academia.
LOL LOL LOL This article comes really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a backlog of three years.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of the bisunours sectors such as art / literature / theatre / media / philosophy / political science, that is to say what are called unemployed diplomas.
I have one of those degrees and I finished production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Certainly the starting salary was lower but you quickly climb the ranks because in the real world what matters is the results more than the knowledge.
This engineering/artistic studies debate has been going on for years.
Scientists can’t solve every problem, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in ways that get results.
Literature, philosophy and art are biununours?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about media studies or whatever absconding industry you've been to.
Literature, philosophy, political science and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn’t it be better to have a real territorial policy to unclog Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I do not see the inhabitants of the end-bottom of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise doing 80km round trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the inner walls and the small belt already have many means of public transport that are more convenient (metro, bus, tram).
Several secured and closed parks, as already exists in northern European cities, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
Benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well we didn't find a place for ONE bicycle hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, that's not good at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other riders of public transport, we have to go down the road to reduce the traffic to reduce the traffic, it seems to me that the main reasons that emerge are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that drive super fast and do not care about the survival of the bikes 2/ we get full of pollution in the head For me the bike paths are necessary to reduce the traffic.
The bike paths is apartheid, it is necessary to coexist but to rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bicycle in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% of sailing trips is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, according to what OR reports, the EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racketeering begins, it would be better to find out who really hides behind this massacre.
Indice: It is not Russia.
I’m not sure I like the way the world is changing.
Looks awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint had actually been filed.
In addition, they should file complaints first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for airspace security, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other planes had been shot down previously, Ukraine was launching in the area of air strikes against the rebels and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents so that airlines pay the overflight rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls defending their usurping government/Western Ukraine ultranationalists – and wanting to show in bulk that Putin shot down flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA’s supply of weapons to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to substantiate his allegations.
So far, the investigators have not said anything like that.
To be called Ricardo and to be such a beotian in eco, it is saddening!
To call oneself Polar is to lose the north is rejoicing.
Only one question from the Boeotians: is the poor man of today poorer than the poor man of yesterday?
I can't help noticing that those who criticize Piketty's book most virulently haven't read it!
It is easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, income inequality of labor, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today joins that of the beginning of the 20<0xC2><0xB0> before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is right, one can debate it without having read the book, the main thing of which is to argue in one way in favor of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavement summarized by the press false?
I have not read it and will not read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and this is what seems to me pure fuming.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn’t humanity become globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the working-class neighborhoods of Britain!
Did someone think his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn’t where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “colored perverts”?
You should not have any "broadcast time" on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely outrageous.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
He is, and always has been, for her to receive a higher education and for her to have the right to decide for herself her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, insofar as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she was saying is that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't state it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but maybe she means that if her father hadn’t given her freedom, she would have been married at 14.
Rather disappointed by this entry in terms of season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a bit of a hard time finding her character as the doppelganger of Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange’s show singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven’t watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I would rather have it all at once than watch 13 episodes spread out over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is sure, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it is especially the risks of staging and editing that amaze me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the sanitization of today's productions.
It escapes me a little to see you throwing the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series outside of the technical qualities.
Well, bah, I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, she wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too dispersed despite a few excellent episodes.
I don’t see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it’s going to end like 24 hours what.
But everyone does what they want!
It is by what I say “I will not look after” that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal to her.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut rather into state spending.
No, let's increase spending please.
Those who wanted to slash spending have failed.
Triggering controversies about relatively small spending items, such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change in orientation that voters seem to wish for, and during all this time some in each camp pretend that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenses.
“Debt” is assets held primarily by financial institutions in this country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government owning a third of my income (before I even talked about taxes on consumption) if I thought it was going to use it wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to wind turbines almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you come to a figure that makes the most ridiculous the tax of the Labour and Labour Party.
Your first <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns <0xC2><0xA3>35,000 a year will pay about <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 (one-seventh of their salary), someone with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 would pay about <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (one-fifth), etc., and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 pays about <0xC2><0xA3>70,000 (just over a third).
What about social contributions?
The higher the social security contributions, the higher the local taxes, the higher the parking fees and the car tag, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is withdrawn from the source before local taxes and the car sticker.
I get paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it’s a problem, of course, I’m happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of tax go.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for work at the door prove this?
Even though 20% of the unemployed would not look, it means that 80% search and do not find.
Being unemployed myself, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a prospective recruiter gets 10 or 20 hp increases my chances that much.
In fact, I haven't heard from P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi in months, does that mean that agents are more busy doing checks than actually getting job listings in?
I don't see the point.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then we need to do without Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive topic?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we ensure that the unemployed perform their duties well in return for their rights.
In the same way that a controller asks the users of a means of transport for their transport permit, a head of a service or are the employees of their work, etc.
No one is screaming scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I have dealt with P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I am not an expert in law.
Firming and control is taking precedence now, while by statute P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only be the employees, they are the ones who pay the costs.
Politicians and non-employed French people grant themselves rights that they do not actually have!
That's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance contributes to the valorization of salaried work.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In reality, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the presence of spirit to ban this year the Hajj in Mecca to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 had their visa applications refused because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from flying to Europe?
I thought it was common sense but apparently those who “know” decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed under strict quarantine.
No one's coming out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they get Ebola while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having contact with people in West Africa despite taking “all necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let us forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to spot people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be quarantined immediately.
That he may succeed in conveying the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is capable of erecting into dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that conception there.
It has only been 20 years since the information appeared as the given premium of humanity, while religion, from the cerebellum, has been directing our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming yet another Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely in the minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any case set foot in the Church, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, removing the notion of sin, too "angiogenic"?
<0x40>louise: Sorry the church has no vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will reach more people...
<0x40>Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envision it pre-existed in Christ.
Hillel a century before him already said: "Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is just a comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity but introduces agap<0xC3><0xAA>.
Your "promoting justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
Next step: we remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who overturned moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming soon.
It's not invented.
Personally, I would choose Som.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth <0xC2><0xA3>30.
If this is the PC version you are interested in, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
I'll take a look.
Obviously not at work.
The IT department's joysticks block all the cool sites.
Hello, is it <0xC2><0xA3>30 then 20% off, or does the <0xC2><0xA3>30 include the 20% off?
Please note: the PC version is only for DX11.
It caught me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no refunds, it's null.
It's time to buy a new video card.
It’s a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon <0xC2><0xA3>30 for PC, <0xC2><0xA3>35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, <0xC2><0xA3>44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they will erase it from your library if they decide to crack down on the people who buy it there while they are out of the intended area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was France of 1940 a “putrid land”?
Say, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisonous gift to me.
Should we love the France of 40, that of the "strange defeat"?
When one sees who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, one wonders if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we do not even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobel laureates are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Have you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at his fair value, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to frequent Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep their chances.
So let’s see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Greetings to the ugly.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage all over the place.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Festival.
It was burgundy.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people out there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
On Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's chance I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope that if I get to 95 years old I will be as vivid as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without bothering you, I think you are moving a little away from the subject.
This famous totality, it forbids quests for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
She promptly reported the arms trade.
Either we have wide-open eyes like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or we have wide-closed eyes.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you are making a monumental misconception: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who doesn’t say a word of consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is in my view the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the breakdown of French society.
If there is no doubt, let it be said.
Who does not say consent, but consent to what?
Consent to proximity to ISIS or to the condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to save goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the election, “revenge” the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the thought of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't give a shit about Scotland because they don't have a seat there.
They can do whatever they want with impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good thing in the long run for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP which will cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the “Promise” thinking he was saving his party but not realizing he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs hold their leader to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats are not from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's rather what's important.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Waxing the pumps by 8% to the detriment of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and it worked out well for her.
Yet he has been running for prime minister in 2015 ever since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and all the way through.
It's East Germany's "Life of Others" or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will at least have a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next post: Amazon makes YOUR book according to YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's gay like the world.
Highly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have the reading of pirated files, books in the public domain or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without snooping.
Given the price I paid the Kobo, it's without regret.

But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of acid-stricken schizophrenic kids.
It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It’s interesting that some of Erdogan’s supporters think Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine.
But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot itself in the foot unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it is effectively shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s lei because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending there a serious retaliatory warning or whether it was merely advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic engagement concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
The Indian Punchline reading is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the shells rocked by the mainstream media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read keeping in mind the previous realistic observations/warnings coming from Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these “moderates” who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy pushes the world into the abyss, and I would suggest those who refer to non-existent “moderates” to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
A Nuremberg trial would be needed for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should we “have”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my friend.
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the triumvirate of the CUP that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a sparse place in Central Asia around the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding there a Turkish empire.
What a delirium!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but other than that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
No clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the womb of a surrogate mother.

As for the children!
What a shame to call them psychologically unbalanced futures.

The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "marketization" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics are not also commodification of bodies?!

These practices were also not done in the name of the church! ...
It is not only Christians and believers who reject these practices...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.

I don’t know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason is saying, maybe they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article about football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of reporting that truly reflects the reality of Northern England’s culture.
Not surprisingly, Paul Mason understood the social and political context well, he understands things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can have an ear if you’re in the London area in November: 99psoul will again be playing soul vinyl, including plenty of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here is a small well-written and well-thought-out article.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.

The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
<0x40>Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace since he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (in fact, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, laid them on the rock, and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them.
The Israeli representative stood up in anger and shouted, “What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian (UN) representative smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the Palestinian Authority’s bipolar government and will not let down its guard.
That this displeases the anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the aim sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And this has always been the case since politics has been globalized.
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it certainly persists!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What is the relationship of power that led to the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a balance of power!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but Guardian journalists seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
A lot of what he says are just pseudo-chomskyist billevesées written not others.
This proves that you don’t understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It’s just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it’s a matter of immaturity).
A truly vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths one prefers not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a novice populist, but the whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it's just going to say that politically active people don't want to vote and don't want to go into politics, that's just going to say that politically active people don't want to go into politics and don't want to go into politics and don't want to go into politics - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limit the democratic commitment.
I’m not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active in presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are whirlwinds who will change their minds if they really risk losing the election), but it’s just annoying to see all those condescending answers that say that this fool who doesn’t argue with young people is
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be nice if people debated what he actually said rather than simply labeling him irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about the vote was completely distorted.
The futility of dragging a ballot into a ballot box every 5 years pisses me off since my vote really counts for nothing.
I want more referendums, e-voting, direct democracy and MPs who are accountable locally to their constituents.
In addition, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand’s words are not his (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas, even if these are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label “pseudo-chomskyist blunders”.
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that’s what the Guardian could do, for Suzanne to do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the nods added to the editing!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but eventually became one of his fans and invited him on his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations but has been marginalized by the mainstream media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This <0xC2><0xAB> sling » reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate is no longer held for a long time at the meetings of History where historians of trade have become minorities and where exchanges of specialists have impoverished to the benefit of ready-to-think condensed Sciences Po type for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They develop both very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on these scapegoats who are the keystone of their thinking.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
We solve the problem of the relationship to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-liberal and / or /libertarian slope (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire for the eradication of the State, the first knowing how to seek the State's aid for its markets) in the sense of at least State / not State at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
Her thinking is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a statement against the three intellectuals cited here.
Nor any support for that matter.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its then-god, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chuya too quickly if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet poses a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty that the accession mechanism represents in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by hard-left human sciences researchers who can’t stand the lack of allegiance to their mantras is laughable enough.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows” that I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You have not had the pleasure of hearing from our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same about white people.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them making violent anti-White remarks.
My father isn't happy that his eldest daughter goes out with a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity spreads outside the big cities, and thanks to that prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, Russians are mostly prejudiced against unqualified temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of Australians on the Chinese and Aboriginals.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand Chinese people, when I've met two of them in my life (including one abroad), I haven't kept bad memories of them, all the people are worth it, and in fact, the people in London were very nice, that's the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don’t remember who we meet, all people are worth it, how to remember who was who.
Do you know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with whites, by comparison?
None, because there's a good chance that the parents of these Whites would physically assault them.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
<0x40>Marabout: Sorry, but the judicial circles are frankly brand a right.
When it comes to the Union of the Judiciary, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made on the basis of the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders that two obstacles be removed.
That of the political vision of the observer as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It then remains the obligatory tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, forces a distinction to be made between the error and the bias of magistrates.
It would be in vain to claim that the acts of justice are not divided between these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance do not come from an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics implicitly revealing that it starts from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to correctly inscribe the following in the third ratio.
The Corruption of the Judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area under consideration is that of the plundering* of heirs committed up to the means of frauds to the procedure* by inheritance genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession obtains a good year 150 million euros while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the almost judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
In order to understand their mechanism, part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the said statistical improvement moderated by the previous commentary, is that the judicial institution has produced, during many disputes between genealogist and heirs reluctant to be stripped, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria an elaborate form of lying?
Absolutely prohibitive prices.
More equipment to defraud the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, custom-built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never before a normal wheelchair, with cumbersome wheels and tires, could not.
As they say, the tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson might invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks epic.
I don't think the inventor of the Whill ever had to clean up a dog poop on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for longboarding.
There are hills here that they would like.
The prices seem really high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bike, so “you see”.
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor.
Many of them have reasonable insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know we need.
You can’t really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately this is just a draft, it is not planned to manufacture it.
I'm CONTENT that the "long-distance" wheelchair doesn't get on the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intensive shelling of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people who are under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation too, since this blockade inflicts a “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
“Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market.”
Ah, that's not the wooden tongue, rather concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, that's for sure, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone with a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-kept territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Remember also that after lifting him, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
I'm a Westerner, so I agree.
Jonathan...
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built upside down from the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the non-profit sharing economy.
Many are only looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it’s getting paid (or at least hoping) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this?
“What do you rent on?”
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to practice a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would always be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...
Where will you moor it?
Marine Le Pen is not right.
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is rising in France.
More than 150,000 young people are leaving school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism will not be impoverished.
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies, therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our foodstuffs, therefore our food, with the structures of care, therefore our health, with our debts, therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, “My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance.”
That was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild Bank Minister to better defend the interests of the banksters, who were solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else competent?
What do you call it: flip your jacket, lower your pants?
Primary and populist reaction
I don’t know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that neither side seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee soon left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was tempestuous at the beginning of the day; I do not know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick Wikipedia search:
“There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two battleship cruisers, who had disappeared into the dark after they had ceased firing, and a chase began.
The Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he got closer he saw that it was only a wreck.
The Nuremberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, bent and badly damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his spotlight on the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee felt that Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.
So, if this is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before the invention of radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in confusion they fled to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already harmed them and cost them about half their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are raised at the UMP to demand that it be recorded in the law that an elected definitively condemned is therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect elected members of the left of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED AN INSCRIPTION TO THE CONS OF THE MAGISTRATES
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to encourage those who will take advantage of their immovability to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is commensurate with their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their small signs "pennies for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold in the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right trade unions targeted personalities on its side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are totally free.
If, at present, the right pays for the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that belong to it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice, but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it must be remembered that the left-wing judiciary union is not the only judicial union and is a minority.
The fact that a minister is so committed to supporting unions shows how useful they can be.
<0x40>MCR The union you are citing may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellery, it is not a secret.
We now wonder if the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than instructing.
<0x40>gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is in the minority.
What are you complaining about?
<0x40>Pivoine: you forget that the magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to indict and incarcerate the all-one-each.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most glory-hungry asshole realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I’d be surprised if someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fills stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all did the Eurovision Song Contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in contests in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens anyway to most of the stars who don’t participate in the contests.
There are few who, after one tube, succeed in making others.
Anyway, most singers/bands can at best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, only has fans in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it’s more likely to lead to a career than the typical path of rock, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar nerds who smoke grass in their father’s garage and swing three chords on a elementary school level poem will surely become stars and the only question is how much they want to touch before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns fairly quickly to racism, because sacralistic ethnologists present us with these faraway people as infinitely superstitious and fraught with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired by everyday considerations, like ours.
Except that you interpret it recklessly in the opposite direction.
That is, but rather than say that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Moli<0xC3><0xA8>res do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as if reminded of seeing the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It's ephemeral deco to fill the void.
Nothing more than that.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists?
Any other discipline would throw to the nettles not at all scientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative critique of the disciplines to make a little laugh?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of salutary modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting .
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and their knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Nowadays we have technical and scientific means so efficient that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries!
There we are in full (and old) controversy about shamanism advanced by the prehistorician Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The shamans of prehistory", especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published by La Maison des Roches).
Thanks for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could start.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we go on with three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play about it.
We couldn’t watch a musical about it, but it would be too gay!
We could expect to have that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse is back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than making me laugh at these kid's ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go away, then.
If these “pussy ass jokes” shock you so much, you don’t have to participate, do you?
Did you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
However, there is an amateur video of the crash on the net...
Video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM chose not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no way those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have left the safety because at the time another vehicle (such as a tow truck) entered the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (TV rights, advertising, money...).
But besides that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I agree with that, too.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to beat the English who led then...
This is your blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to dig up all your shit.
No, just don't.
There have been a lot of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts stewards in danger of death for a distant story of the possibility of victory of one driver at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out of safety because it's the FIA.
Nuance of size.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of imagery allows the FIA to avoid the inconvenient questions of: How does the Commissioner wave a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because we clearly see one of the commissioners waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are more under a yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misunderstanding of F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the waved green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The commissary post just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal pace.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid that, in the end, it’s just for the money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having a sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Buzzing with news that you really don’t need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
“When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch the fear” It should be “derail,” not “cough.”
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “derailing.”
I wonder if all the people who are frightened that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that nicely and solidly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh. It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media is talking about most things with that upside-down optimism.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and distressed (without getting to hysteria) so that the government can make us skip when it needs to.
I think it makes perfect sense that if we have to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn’t there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing through fear?
Congratulations for this post, and for still being of this world almost 35 years later.
In the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I am bluffing, living with the certainty of spending there for years .....
Testimony completely useless.
As always when it comes to science.
Not only are testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective appraisal of facts.
<0x40>traffic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we refrain from asking psychiatric patients questions when we have reliable observations from loved ones.
My psychiatric record mentions that my mother psychiatrist explains that I was telepathically educated by her stepmother.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's an unimportant subjective testimony.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (<0x3D> here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
So what do you base your research on, then?
About fantasies?
Are you putting fancy theories and facts on a par (<0x3D> giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the fake word adored by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think they are great psychologists after reading D'Ansembourg.
<0x40>Jim: There are plenty of empty buzzwords in the psychiatrists.
Cyrulnik gave us the blow of “resilience”.
As he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has crafted a reliable scale of measurement for us to quantify, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn't that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's *not* a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
And why, then?
It was a great series and it seems that those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us leave our salvation to the almighty who can perform miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hook up?
The only solution that comes to mind is the pipi-caca humour, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's series.
The kids were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
Keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarriage?
It will not be the same if we do not see the threads and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (though being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to rebroadcast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; it’s been at least 40 years since we’ve had one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6:00 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-rate commercial channels and you can still see it at these times.
And in addition, the half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I’m probably a “sad” 60-year-old guy, but I don’t watch this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the Esplanade Mosque!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all Israeli excavations under and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have failed to find anything.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and scuttled it continuously!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful event.
Can God recognize His own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: "Praise be to God!"
To brag about tourism in Israel, we are often shown naïve, half-naked, languid youngsters on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what the advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
It is a pity that the Reuters photographer did not take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to enter the Temple Mount and who prefer to slam the Jewish faithful downstairs, praying at the Wailing Wall.
<0x40>Mat, If this photo disturbs you, it is right, it is neither the newspaper nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not tenable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be spinning, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever higher salaries to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of moaning and moaning when someone else goes on strike, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that you don’t fuck people up with impunity.
Unless democracy is abandoned, in which case it is sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are worst.
For example, China and India.
All of this can't end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it's held up.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
That sounds incredible, but that is exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable damage this deal will have on our lives.
It is only recently that we are starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
Didn’t Churchill say “blood, sweat and tears”?
These are great benefits, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the XVIII there were trade unions in all the regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (finally, her officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe herself to be the safe house of France’s eternal values, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even though it's becoming more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still miss the union of married men, single people, married women, single people, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don't write French correctly, I syndicate.
You are warned, it will be your fault.
Protected professions with trade unions are already suffering enough for the defence of categoryal interests, which has created a rupture of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of an official.
One can very well imagine a system ensuring a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster assured.
And with the carts being prepared, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here commented on...
Suppressed "through his delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of enterprises."
This is absolutely essential with the eruption of informational power.
And yet you opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off review”. ????
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I've been watching, and I can tell you that some of them have been seasoned well.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (albeit misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely enough, the show ends with a victory of the least worst baker; no one has done like "boom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and bow down in front of your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all of these outsiders were kept away.
And there’s also this idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears in the last week.
I love cooking, but I can’t imagine doing that to myself.
I’m grateful to those who do and offer us great entertainment and pushes us to try new things.
Forward to GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to sort out, I don’t know how they were able to choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could have found was the somewhat dry base (although I agree with Hollywood that the green icing on Richard's mill didn't make them want to anyway Richard had already lost by that time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time allotted.
There is also cancer that is waiting, with the solar wind blows.
Definitely, everything succeeds at the moment.
A bad time to pass for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn’t be enough solar wind to “throw out” ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancers”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV rays.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they have the benefit of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and lets UVAs and most UVBs pass through.
Do you know that you don’t have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as an outsider when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to show pedagogy.
Not to mention that I am a melanoma addict, UV only accelerates its development.
They do not provoke it.
Proof: Not all tanned people have melanomas.
That is, when a toubib tells you to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything else: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we bend it?
And, more importantly, can we put it in the mixer?
Or put it in the mixer.
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if you apply enough force and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and therefore has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communication equipment.
But for us others,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it.
It's a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every conversation.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke about folding that I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and we can hardly see how it could return to it.
Let's go, let's go................................................................................................................................................................................
Most likely, this is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and which is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know at all how they do these things.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on eBay clearly show the absence of an FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah the article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in "industrials" We put forward super u but all the brands and meme the small business are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650€ (medium salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to put their priorities where they want to.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without resentment, I kiss you
We call bobos, or rather boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from realities.
It is the total unbundling of thought-reason.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferia, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy-handed ideology and tartuferia so do not be surprised to often meet critics about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorizing as well as for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find myself in it.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolours are monobloc.
Have you understood the concept of left-caviar?
Well you are able to understand the concept of the boboecolo.
It is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the environment at all.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the ecologists because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look this giraffe in the face.
It is so badly made that it vaguely resembles a female nude.
Shut up, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of truth in this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
That's *art*.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
This is not really a fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are realistic reproductions of dogs who smoke while playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is more than just representing the real.
If you’re just looking for that, a camera will do the trick.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the picture speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still room for savings: riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service.
Honesty requires us to say that France is shrinking its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operation without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
<0x40>edmond: that's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
Let all those who have been close to the military thing dare to come and say here, eyes in eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting out laughing...
Applying the same potion to the entire public service and public finances will get a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why La Défense can be a bit busy!
Well, yes, the savings that everyone agrees on must be made, it has to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls moan at the murder when it happens at home, the poor darlings.
It should be done but above all that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for the local authorities, history repeats itself at every post closure, maternity ward, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for savings, of course.
It is strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not rejoice in the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I have ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It’s depressing to scroll through his Facebook feed and see that 80% of his friends started their statuses with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they're going to make a movie out of it.
He will surely rely on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally bumps into his ex on the bus going to work and only realizes there that his skirt has gone back into his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and to clench his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don’t have the “internet.”
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
God, I have to watch this movie before I die.
I can’t believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I’ve ever read!
Charlie really just demonstrated that he is at the very top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm falling backwards!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible lightning and the insurmountable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, my God, it was really bad.
Especially if they are neither women nor transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice we have our right to save our planet confiscated by states that play truffles at every meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take matters into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted on the energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away...
Wind turbines and solar farms are tomorrow’s round points.
All financed by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear talk.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the sector is not fully controlled, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided of course we drastically reduce our consumption.
Electricity from renewables to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned in any way.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon to other stages.
Electricity from renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittency.
Replacing nuclear power with renewable wind or PV would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial I am not insulting you I am a Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981 plus I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove contrary to what I said.
For what I did not say it was you who lent me ideas I did not say anything about Germany nothing in fact you did not respond to what I was saying and as all right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and inefficient way of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
If you don't count the uranium extraction and construction and if you don't count the water vapour greenhouse gases of lesser effect than the CO2 it is true recall two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes in water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a “Giant of South Asia”...!!
The last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
Not surprisingly, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora’s box full of corruption and mafia.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Athletico Kolkata winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to IPL cricket and now football, how could we ever compete with our “noise neighbors”?
The race to the low cost launcher is paid in cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only manifests itself with too cold a helium.
Therefore, we may not be in a defect of design, but of implementation...
Unlike arianespace which is a private company, it seems that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
They may be paying for the satellites in frigates who knows..
This is all the more unfortunate as many media outlets are taking over the titles of articles in a loop – and many readers are picking up only those titles.
All in all, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Absolutely agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly calls into question the project while it is only a launcher problem.
