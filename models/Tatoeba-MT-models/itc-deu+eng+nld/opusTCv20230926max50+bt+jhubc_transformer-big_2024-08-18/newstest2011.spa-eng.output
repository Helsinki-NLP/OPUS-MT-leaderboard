The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop
The new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD councillors in the capital are apparently going to have to overcome the obvious language barriers for the Prague Board and City Council components to understand their renewed SDG comrades.
The Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz period "examined" the members of the new Council of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to verify their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary using the political flower and cream of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least, they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I'm rather a newcomer to Prague politics," cultural councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> said during the "colleague" terminology exam.
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted the same way.
Maybe you know the concept of "golf hole."
"Maybe it's the only expression of all the ones you asked me that I use from time to time."
"If not, I usually don't use slang."
From the glossary, the definitions of which were published by the newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial staff chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities in Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "Prague's largest golf hole", "going to the bakery", "bull's neck", "treason of the capital" and "armour".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, directly refused to do so.
“I don’t get into these things and I don’t want to value how the civic Democrats have fun.”
“What matters to me is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As we have seen, Councilman Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not realize that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The word "Voldemort" says nothing to Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>; the only term he hit on the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
“It’s the Blanka tunnel,” says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, who immediately adds, “But I rather know it from the news.”
“I’m going to have to sign up for a language course,” he jokes.
Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Councillor for Environment Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort really is and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where to find that character; furthermore, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon it is revealed to Plach<0xC3><0xBD> that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that he does not employ such a vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the socio-democrats there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
“I asked my teammates, but it really looks like we don’t have anything like it.”
"Rather, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or we play word games with names," says Prague's <0xC4><0x8C>SSD president Petr Hulinsk<0xC3><0xBD>, whose party mates call Hulda.
“They called me B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za at school, but I don’t know if my classmates also call me that,” confesses his own nickname Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tested the name and it works.
For his party comrades, Weinert is D<0xC4><0x9B>da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they were associated prior to the misleading elections during the party sponsorship, is nicknamed "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" ("playmobil") by some of his comrades.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of club rights" apparently recalls that Petr Hulinsk<0xC3><0xBD> obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as published in a pamphlet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually of advanced age, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men seldom suffer such a thing if not."
“Healthy young women are also not isolated, because they help in the labors and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, takes care of a special residence of more than 100 women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an informative pamphlet that should help prevent the witch hunt.
However, this has a catch.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” warns Die Standard newspaper about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso’s neighbor, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a miserable pile of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was caught in the oil used for ritual anointings.
It caught fire when the group wanted to "throw out the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “The soul-eaters have always been a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government tries to appease the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"The Gambian president Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that allegedly had been related to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself by black magic."
“To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, the military and the president’s personal escort, forcibly took randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay on the estate.
Following international pressure, they finally released about 1,000 detainees.
The tenant of Bakala: warms up with charcoal stoves and signs a higher rent
The elderly and stiff man crossed the doors of the customer service center of the RPG company Byty of the "coal magnate" Zde<0xC5><0x88>ek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-story leases: his own, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is serving his sentence.
The three of them have just been caught up in the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-room apartment with a separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," shows with the finger the man in the new contract of his son, on whose signature he has full powers.
“But I signed it,” he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But, in view of this, the man only makes an ademan.
“Everyone says one thing,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major testing ground for liberalization.
After the New Year will happen with the vast majority of the apartments that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to pick up a number.
"Rent 2011", can be read on a light button on your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
There is almost no time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly married couple arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of tenants of most of the 44,000 RPG-owned flats around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the cards an increase of the rent between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
“It’s been running for a week, so it’s starting,” the workers respond, after hesitating briefly, when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and Bakala’s old mining flats are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were treated loud and clear by the deputy speaker of the parliament, Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek, from Ostrava, of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
“They didn’t even change my goddamn bathroom plate,” the man mentioned in the introduction vents.
According to the workers, at the moment they come more than anything retired to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign in time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half of the discount on the February rental.
However, the window of mining “liberalization” certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rental in 2011 about forty or fifty people," estimates the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rent, the matter will have to be resolved by an independent judge.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible way to proceed and fully compliant with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
“No one is going to be judged here,” says one of RPG Byty’s employees, and a man standing on the street in front of the customer service center gives her, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court,” he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek warns you in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait," he said.
The rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
“Current rentals still do not cover even the amounts needed to maintain the community fund,” recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of the RPG company Byty, adding that the neglected state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for landlords, the main reason for increasing rent.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest four billion dollars in apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be at most 7.50 Czech kroner per square meter per month," it says on the screen.
Just increased by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square meter,” says RPG.
At 2,600 flats, rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not suddenly affect rents, but will escalate in four to eight years.
In addition, he adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent increase (see the graph) again in the floors, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the lease agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need daycare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with everything that belongs to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can attend.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose study numerous well-known buildings emerged from Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-kindergarten.
About 90 people work in the company, mainly in the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the daycare is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers its workers as part of its social program.
Builders and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-kindergarten was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-nursery is financed through the European Social Fund under the Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (more than CZK 2.8 million) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design has the obligation to keep the mini-kindergarten in operation with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the submission of the application for funding contributed the company Economy Rating.
The care of the children is in the hands of qualified staff, and a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present throughout the day for their care. The nursery currently welcomes children without age limit, although most of them are under three years old.
Since it is a "mini-kindergarten", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to suit the needs of the parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the contents of the mini-kindergarten programme are comparable to the regular pre-school programme.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach even English.
The classroom not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up late school children when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design ranks among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced the marketing of staff.
The House of Bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Look at Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Due to its skeleton-like shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of scales and the ubiquitous lines gently curved, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
The cover of the house plays with dreamlike lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, you observe a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Snake and the twisting of the shapes continues to surprise us also inside.
Corrugated wood copies window frames, railings, door ornaments, peepholes and signs.
Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA0>cia, emerged from the remodeling of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of carrying out a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
The architect Josep Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his plans of the project appeared ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
In the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Park Güell, where other pieces of it are located.
Due to its organic form, the locals shortly after its completion dubbed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific opening mechanism of the windows, began to call it "the house of yawning".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, appears the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed in the house a unique system for the time of central heating with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Its inclination of forty-five degrees may be strange.
During the construction, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> did not respect at all the construction rules of the moment and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated about the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city was so impacted by the result that it asked to be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: just fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely traversed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the salons and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>, not only obtained a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> plays with light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and skylights.
The play with the two colors brings maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which instead absorb the sun’s rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious apartment and the most recharged of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not negligible, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entrance of other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> constructions in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit them at home.
How to choose the mattress and bed base: women and men look for different things
Nothing pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, i.e. the mattress and the bed base.
First of all, they must be perfectly complemented so that they adapt to specific users.
During the election numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, state of health and sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and the mattress pad are placed.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the channels in the center are not properly ventilated and, above, are on a firm base, they keep moisture inside.
When choosing a bed, habits also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
“Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who time problems with the nervous system, so they receive poor information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate viscoelasticity.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn around like after a hard game.
He just sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example singles, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule for calculating the width can be applied: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk towards your elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, an expert from Cechu <0xC4><0x8D>aloun<0xC3><0xAD>k<0xC5><0xAF> a dekoratér<0xC5><0xAF>, who has been dealing with the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for many years, a subject she teaches.
In the double rooms, each one needs its own bed base and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bed bases at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interior a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"By touching it with your hand or by accommodating on the mattress, the springs should certainly not be noticed," warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a certain type of mattress.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and you can not wash their cover, which is often done today.
And, since every night we perspire between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a but.
That's why sellers give a tip: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of cleaning and washing the cover carefully, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers with a zipper closure are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when they are opened they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in the larger models (and by one person) when lifting the mattress may seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a bed base, do you have a firm board?
Never! Never!
At most for the beds designed to spend one night the visits.
However, you should make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes in the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulable sheet bed bases containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although a bed base with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the lumbar area sheets are reinforced and their stiffness can be regulated is always best.
Articulable sheet bed bases should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to recline.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the blades, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "surround" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very broad shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "male", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are cross-frame or slatted bed bases with so-called multi-torsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the right mattress and pillowcase, if you use a bad pillow (large and "soft"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of them can be relaxed.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on your side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder pad or the softer area of the mattress) as the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses seem to have something to do with original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
“Biologic, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin,” explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" themselves with plant extracts from the breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel warmer.
Favorites currently?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities allows mattresses to be manufactured from different areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who play a therapeutic role usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as health means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and bed bases.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is available for free.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during the takeoffs the astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents are using people tracking devices to control their children
The fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in the case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
At the moment the device has the approximate size of a match box, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
“We’re all trying to tell ourselves that it’s not about spying, but another means to lessen the chances of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone’s purse without their knowledge, but we have not yet come across such cases.”
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> warns that if the child does not want to take it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even the youngest children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to prevent them from being controlled.”
“Previously, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In his opinion, it is questionable whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
“If it is a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will almost always check if the child is carrying any type of electronic device that can reveal his location.”
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices expands, it will also search for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be done with a lot of publicity."
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even in the event that, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can be of help.
"The device can be set to send the position regularly after a certain period of time."
“If it is damaged, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question.”
“The most expensive devices have an inclination meter built in, so if the person just slips and sits still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smart phones with navigation, in which only special software must be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a similar size to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for that reason, tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
“In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device.”
“Or to identify him after a certain time, which can save the police time,” he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology that is used for vehicle tracking.
This is the verification of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to encircle the whole Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to set off explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of wick to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the wick for explosives from the STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The General’s staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick by saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers of wick per year.
According to the calculations of the fireworks technicians of the army, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, should perform such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high-ranking officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
Neither Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and Army Captain Vlastimil Picek wanted exemptions.
Only in this way could the army be justified in spending sixty kilometers of wick.
Such a length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if that were the case, the army would have sufficient stockpiles for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (including adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stock for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they have scarce ammunition for various weapons, so that even the practice of firing for a matter of money is limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also don't understand that we repeatedly buy such quantities of wick."
“But it’s their decision, and they’ll certainly know why they act like that.”
“For us, the army is a good customer that we, as a company, try to satisfy,” admits STV Group Commercial Director Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek defends the hundreds of kilometers of wick, saying he will also have stockpiles of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, of STV Group, indicates that the wick only has a shelf life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, of two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of wick, he obtained a discount.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's order of 244 kilometers," said Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence's shopping centre.
Just to compare: the annual wick consumption of the police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the ammunition of World War II or left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only the right amount to exhaust the ammunition before its useful life runs out.
They decided it for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable wick types can be obtained.
The Ministry is already clearly struggling to finish tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of 200,000 people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years there will be the following problem with the current one: you will have to remove hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I am still living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
The last edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun of Liberec.
His success story seems to be drawn from a film.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered from seasonal jobs abroad and a credit from the bank he bought a half-crashed house composed of five stories.
Considering he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
“At present, the value for money of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it,” says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He began renting the reconstructed first floor to foreign workers.
All the income he obtained was invested back into the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room boarding house.
Since then, in seven years in business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tise, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” said the No. 1 entrepreneur last year.
“This sale of hotel opening licenses greatly helped by winning the ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ contest,” Pytloun added.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in and around Liberec.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” she recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends to everyone who wants to try a company to participate in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he still lives on the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
in total about seventy.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to be involved in something that gained general recognition.”
“It’s not my own personal success, it’s the result of the hard work of the whole team.”
“Only my name is on the front page,” Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we have had at Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may have already gone through the worst.
The owner of Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone contest "Company of the Year", last year in the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury valued their efforts, with which they managed to turn a small technical workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition,” says the winner of last year.
The history of Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the state proposed to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of property during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They gained a greater presence also among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the contest in the media.
“Not only did our customers start to see the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners started to value the collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year was perhaps not just a sign of the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
It was also recognised for its business results until 2008 and, in part, 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year for machinery sales.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
“Obviously, we didn’t get rid of that situation either.”
“Revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must sometimes even take unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company’s profits, even if it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite everything, where Farmet did not cut spending was in research and development.
“With the grants we have built a research and training centre, we have strengthened our presence in the international market and obtained excellent ratings at national fairs,” says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are rising again, and with them, the number of new employees.
“The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A Survey Reveals Ridiculous Rules
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when it carries out a check on the insured's taxes," <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The objective of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it is for the fourth time part of the business tournament of the publication Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny and begins to create a hobby also among the general public.
While last year’s edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, this year it almost reached 4,000.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations to spare that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in terms of the number of documents needed for tax returns we are in first place worldwide," says Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation improved especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have a company, the Czech Republic is in the 74th position, that is, eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "anti-award" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Earn the nonsense that gets the most votes.
For this year’s survey, more than 100 rules and regulations were presented, including 105 that make no sense.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year’s seventy proposals is published on the page of the contest.
The announcement of the contest, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world often participate.
This year, for example, this event was attended by Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
“Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state continually puts obstacles in the way of entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” announced Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in the water of drunkenness.
In 2007, what most annoyed people was the employer’s obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, intending to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in number of votes in 2007, that is, the communication to the work office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the so-called green card law.
And the third one is the winner.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their practice a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
That is why this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had removed the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny competition is the category called Responsible Company of the year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone's mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of Vodafone Empresa’s 2010 main competition, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, for example, people with disabilities, in others, the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, there is a stationery store that is especially concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the workforce; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of Czechia and in the Vodafone Company of the year contest finished in third place in the region.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment,” explains businesswoman Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The Enlogit IT company in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona in Trouble grant, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the representative of the company Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
The laundry company Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD> in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive special bonuses that affect their pension funds, is also in good standing with a mention.
“We give benefits in food, transport, skills improvement and leisure,” says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> of the Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l Czasch construction company, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for the Vodafone Enterprise of the Year contest who answered the questions on the registration form and submitted it to the organizers by August 15 were automatically named in the Responsible Company of the Year category.
The organizers removed incomplete or erroneous forms from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the year contest, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the year contest."
“Individual applications for this contest are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main Company of the Year contest,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police have made several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media businessman and real estate entrepreneur Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
It appears that it is attempting to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the land auctioned is received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million kroner for it.
“At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender,” Pilsen’s chief prosecutor Antonie Zelena told Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo, adding that at the moment she cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On how he was able to influence the public auction, given the little official information, one can only speculate.
Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for the Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> Agricultural Fund, responded to Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo’s questions by saying that police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
“This is a customer, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public auction is called "Call for the submission of proposals for land transfer in accordance with the law on land" and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a higher value than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Depending on the bids, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the largest bid," the spokeswoman said.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had information on who was going to appear at the call and, since he was also an interested person because he acquired various rights of restitution, he proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
So please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for some time.
He was in the case of the former head of the PF V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has just obtained land from the Fund for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular where a large road to the Borsk<0xC3><0xA1> pole industrial area should be built.
Afterwards, he exchanged them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to take several hundred crowns a month out of the wallet from January onwards.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by about 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The increase in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 crowns more per year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers lowered prices as support for energy production from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics, has increased.
However, the gas is moderately expensive, especially at a time when heating is used the most and therefore the consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also have a couple hundred crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive across the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, homes in Pardubice or Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will pay about 50 crowns more per month for central heating from January onwards, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 crowns more per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Pragans will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the prices of renting 450,000 flats rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 flats in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, will increase rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take those who disagree with the new lease to court.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 flats, could increase by as much as 10% next year.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in mode, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of doctors encountering such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take a long time to get drunk."
"Now the fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," says to Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo the head of pediatrics at Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
"When they get a bottle from their father's cupboard, it can be whisky, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
“Vodka has the advantage of being lightened with juice and not smelling as much,” he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
“Those are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren.”
“In some cases, they use brandy that they took at home,” adds Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>.
According to Chief Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, thirteen- and fourteen-year-old drinkers usually appear in hospitals.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics at Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
“It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 of alcohol in her blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy,” the department’s doctor says of this case.
"He was at the Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice fair at some dance party."
“The interesting thing is that his mother wasn’t even surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours,” the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest from parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot properly speak of dependence.
"Alcoholic means a person who has been chronically dependent on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains chief Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
According to spokeswoman Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, this year in the pediatric clinic of Motol were hospitalized until mid-November forty drunk children.
However, the statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the walking medical examination, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply meet after school and drink brandy, for Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n there are three seasonal ups and downs that should be mentioned: Halloween, New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink from bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
“On Witch’s Day, I’ve come to see as many as seven drunken children in admissions at once,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
"They take it much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and they don't hurt at all."
“They’re only confused about where they are,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n says, adding that patients often lose their good mood at least when they see the expenses they’ve generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients comes at a cost of tens of thousands of crowns.
“I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when I tell the children directly on the visit how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend all summer in a youth job so that you would earn enough to pay that night,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n adds.
Health insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 planes are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time a device of this type has been found in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which until now used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seaters.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, already took over them last week.
Jan Peje<0xC5><0xA1>k, from the defence press department, said it was not yet known when the planes would be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, without any additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The two-seater L-159T1s were exchanged in their current state," he told Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for the amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new planes has already been received by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS pledged to have the planes added to the equipment of some allied countries.
“The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for pilot practices from NATO countries.”
“It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how they will use them in this framework,” says Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The newspaper Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense direction claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of domestic aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already sued the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by conducting a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Kbely Prague airport in fourteen days.
A finger index longer than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular index are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer journal.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger may be a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should have a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the indica finger of the right hand shorter than the annular.
They had the same odds of getting prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men below 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows the study, but that he does not think the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "completely demonstrated".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday covered in snow.
Roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and snow machines circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between 89 and 93 kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of commercial vehicles and cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was broadcast by the operator of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC5><0x99>edn<0xC3><0xAD>ho automotoklubu (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
In kilometer 91 a truck broke down, in 93 two commercial vehicles crashed that caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers must drive slowly after Brno on kilometre 190 or cross Brno and join kilometre 182 in K<0xC3><0xBD>valce.
There have been jams of several kilometers.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and thermometers indicate -7 <0xC2><0xB0> C.
Clogs are forming, for example, in Prosek, although <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> and N<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC3><0xAD>ru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> Airport was closed from 11 p.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Currently, you can already drive on most of the roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
Three secondary roads are closed to traffic in Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska, snow tongues are forming in Brn<0xC4><0x9B>nska and chains are needed in Blanenska to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the worst affected places was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rus<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment it is not possible to say when they will be opened to circulation.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nska, caution is required in the Bilé Karpaty (White Carpathians) area.
The roads of the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, plus in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall is gradually returning to the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. military is using in Afghanistan a new “smart” weapon, known at the moment only by the codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the progress of the game" towards their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with extremely precise aiming.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive charge it contains causes it to actually function like a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, wall or trench.
No doubt, you can’t use normal protection, and when you throw your killer shower of metal splinters, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use “smart” technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
“When you pull the trigger, the gun loads and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters,” says Audette.
400 jobs are being moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 men and women will move in July from their previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt’s Niederrad district.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term another 100 employees of the consortium, which were previously scattered throughout the region, will be accommodated there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt's head of the economics section, Markus Frank (CDU), said he had won a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site."
Fujitsu is settling in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu’s decision.
The management informed the city of his intention beforehand.
“Of course we have offered the company our help,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons led to the fall.
In such a way, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The building previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining buildings on Marienbader Platz for ten years in a controversial project to build the spa town.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the city, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is in charge of the criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and regarding the level of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and appraisal companies, the manufacturer of Software for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, have been installed, as well as then joined Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium from Tokyo is recognized as the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the next subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company under the name of TDS.
That’s why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twenties, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anguish is increasingly gripping Wikileaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind it is political pressure following the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is reportedly detained in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an internet homeland in Europe.
US Senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, should remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon server."
“Speak freely in the country of freedom,” the activists said on Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Earlier, the internet company, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to publishing secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services website to cope with the high figures of access to the documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: “Perfect, we will allocate our dollars to hiring people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server through WikiLeaks after an employee of Sen. Joe Lieberman had called for investigations, CNN reported, according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the Guardian reported.
“I had wished that Amazon would take these steps sooner, before previous WikiLeaks classified information posts,” he said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and reckless process of WikiLeaks puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to spread stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently labeled the investigation in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
WikiLeaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why he fears for Assange’s safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains unrevealed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to North American statements.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee said the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations must be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, an adviser to head of government Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should “be killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange there is a growing dispute.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange has called for the Secretary of State’s resignation, should she be responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website.”
The U.S. government needs to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed as an exceptional commissioner, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing “the important structural reforms” that are necessary in light of the Wikileaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must endanger the publication of WikiLeaks.
"We have done everything possible to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At Gelato University in Bologna, ice cream parlors are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream parlors has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream come from?
The ice cream maker and the ice cream maker.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice cream.
The ice cream maker takes the ice cream cream out of the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream parlors has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream parlour of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk in the soft ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a teacher of this art from California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years in an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training nor the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why each ball has something romantic."
The first step to preparation seems very easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it to four degrees.
Then open the faucet of the machine and a pasteurized white basic cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises them to discard the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream "not only natural ingredients", has perhaps used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, from guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a sound granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"Yet they must experience sometime."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Course participants can now use the freezers.
Luciano allows them to make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream each time, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They carry out the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
What you know best doesn’t necessarily depend on having more toffee aroma or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary that hazelnut ice cream tastes like nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The task force makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First a balanced mix highlights the flavor of the ice cream, Luciano says.
The making of ice cream is an arty problem: Peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, it is necessary to reduce the proportion of sugar of the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the types of fruit (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
Not only does the utensil for the automatic processing of the basic dough help.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to a temperature below zero.
In spite of everything, all the automation is left out as far as the small paste is concerned.
The Brazilian Gustavo smears himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if it were an uncontrollable mini-first giant.
“In all the courses,” says master Luciano, “it’s just a matter of time that something like this happens.”
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority EFSA has infiltrated the industry that experiments with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa’s expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been hired by the Ilsi association for years.
Consortia such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to Efsa’s testing standards for genetically modified plants, putting him in a clear conflict of interest, then criticizes.
The Efsa provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ilsi’s situation and mimic the deed of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a senior manager of Efsa went without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that her side.
Recently, the Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which carried out the General Office for the Environment as well as a parliamentary EU clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some from the industry, are used, as long as they are of a high and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But you must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the mandate of Lobby.
On this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that currently transgenic plants are allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
“If the risks are not sought, how will they be found?” asks the accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
She has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a rule.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck says.
The Trail of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind my back.
There were demonstrations
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing became debris.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He excites: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“There would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or send it to the dumpster,” he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He spoke to the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the shootout.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram heap cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
Approximately half are still in the forest, the rest have long since been sold.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, in charge of projects.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top of it.
The Stuttgart impulse stone has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“Actually this stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political component."
Ascend to his off-road, take a tour through his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, became interested in computers and eventually worked with stones.
He is a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the country's largest antique stone dealer.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones chopped.
“They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge,” he explains.
White limestone, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
He points out a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Nice travertine."
Formerly the massifs belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, tuff of the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple rig and a wagon, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people had to make the stone dealer, in addition stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man who takes care of the remains.
Soon he'll have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting talent around great potentials
An active influx reigns in the buffet.
16 students crowd around the buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Braunschweig Technical University and car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of brainstorming contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, gather in a melee fight around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Its mission: To hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labor market and are hired by others.
And because universities don’t provide publications about their students’ skills, they try to spot exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins over the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes pens, rubbers and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the excited young talents the internship programs and student jobs and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both parties: “Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience.”
“In turn, VW can meet students, look more closely at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
“The main point previously was in the technical projects,” Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not, they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacant engineering jobs in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineering vacuum will grow even further.
At the audit and advisory firm KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe the KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the start.
Only the cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la cr<0xC3><0xA8>me of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple journey alone was short."
For the Dykta scout the notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
“Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, above all, small and medium-sized companies, classic with their labor fairs.
"We try to get students at specialized fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, staffer for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company’s website.
"It is very difficult to fill the vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"The teachers advise that you can do internships with us or do your theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium normally cannot offer it,” says Stübe, the head of staff.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what it asks the employee how satisfied he is with the job and with the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the head of staff, also expects extra points in her classification by her aspirants to work.
“I think the applicant looks especially at the external rankings of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in recent years.
The Washington government issued a blunt ban and thereby overturned its previous plans in an unappealable manner.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast remain new drillings closed for the moment.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What triggered this strict ban, which will at least be in effect for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Before the disaster that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted further drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various peterolera consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by employing tougher controls and tighter security regulations.
Currently the responsible supervisory authority, which after being accused of corruption has fallen into disrepute, is reforming at the root.
Obama also announced that the lucrative fiscal loopholes for oil and gas consortia would be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the gulf will be lower thanks to tighter regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest drag on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by the consulting firm BDO - ahead of Wednesday's extraction ban.
The American Energey Alliance complains of insecurity in the sector: “No one knows exactly what changes with regulation.”
Investments in new mining projects are prolonging for the time being, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
River water is oil brown, it smells like a gas station: Millions of litres of oil spilled have shattered nature in Nigeria’s Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassured journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that on the surface float brown spots of oil.
I used to catch prawns here in handfuls, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinky regions in the world.
In the path of the river route that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, which dips its hand in the water, will take out some full of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the colliding palms and hanging their palms.
In vain flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the outer barrier is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of an earlier paradise with the smell of a gas station expands in it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," says Hurricane Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The warlike comparison proceeds.
The area of the Ogoni settlement has been a battleground for years: here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here the Shell consortium had to place its first factory in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: While they pumped more than two million barrels of black gold daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters, steel platforms protruded like bizarre water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most have total corrosion.
At every instant a head fails, says Akpobari, then a constant jet of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the enduring environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see leaking pipes as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the conventional world, the scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the defect rates of pipes are "about a multiple greater than elsewhere".
In a place, which from a distance seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the open sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Between one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the drillings, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, flames a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil heats up in the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the group’s head.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the vessel, later the oil pipe leaks and finally diesel comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-liter diesel a day: "It gives us 34,000 naira", about 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of fuel shortages in one of Africa’s largest oil states.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel just 40 euros-cent per liter illegal heaters can offer even less: Thus they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from “the bunkers,” who hacked into the network of pipelines that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this pace at least 16 million liters of oil are lost a day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only an insignificant part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the best part in cisterns and sell it cheaply on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the lazy way of production.
“If the oil companies did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the Ogoni are mostly shattered by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as the Chinese one."
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular <0xC3><0x96>lmann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special army unit catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to profit from the raw material.
“This damned invention has completely shattered our country,” Akpobari said.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big safety problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce “a catastrophic engine failure.”
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers of Qantas’ Airbus, which made an emergency landing in early November, were far more fortunate than one might imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s thanks to their investigations, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential flaw has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected Rolls-Royce-manufactured engines belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus which had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline is suing the British turbine maker.
He filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sydney that made it possible to take further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand have lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will conduct more safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, an ATSB spokesman.
The security issue has become important enough to inform everyone affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet ashore for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily ashore.
Lufthansa has reinstated the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada Across the Country Causes Traffic Chaos
Totally white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed almost all over the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Almost all over the country reached freezing temperatures on Thursday night, which has triggered traffic chaos at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snowplows are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects live tides with water level 1.2 meters above their usual level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partially 30 centimeters of fresh snow and cold, strong winds are responsible for swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported major disturbances in the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, major upheavals are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on rails or broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service took care of the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
Winds with snow sweep the streets.
At Germany’s largest airport, snowy winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The snowplows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
On many streets, there were already many accidents on Wednesday afternoon.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a track junction in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg because of the snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she overturned her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be increasingly soft and dusty and will therefore swirl in gentle gusts.
But the wind will slow down.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to secede from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutsche Bank arranged its headquarters: Twin towers in Frankfurt’s bank district were modernized; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the reunion, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether it is advisable to own the properties or sell them and then re-rent them," he said.
This is why Germany’s largest credit institution resigns from its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
The energy reforms reached figures of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the newspaper's towers renamed as "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold to a bank fund or to an independent investor has not yet been disclosed, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were presumed dead after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the site of disgrace, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the gleaming glow of the sun at Greymouth on New Zealand’s southern island.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In tribute to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal belongings, under clothing and surfboards.
The flags flew halfway across the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," New Zealand government president John Key told participants in the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
She cannot assume the death of her son until she has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gore fit into art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the frontiers of the genre with his epic of battles "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and rip his enemies' guts out of their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful death cries.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the backstage offer to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has multiple target groups, it’s a shame they can’t discard each other.
Director Winding Refn regards his savages and the trilogy about the drug-trafficking hairstyle "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with anything more mainstream humor or anything less artistic house brutality.
A brain mass and sprouting guts cannot deter most fans of artistic cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck for an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shuts up again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hidden, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
There is no escape for the spectators.
Refn feels just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy soundtrack of trance make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a young blonde boy, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
About midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that exits the river.
According to information from the CIA’s International Intelligence Service at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the vicinity of el-Kibar very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves other purposes than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the interior.
The reactor had been in operation for a short time, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is hardly better known than at the time, the riddles grew bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack the CIA was fully confident that the Syrians had built a reactor in al-Kibar, but that it barely saw any indication that there was “a nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a “supposed reactor”, although they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible”.
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of it, a senior UN diplomat lapidarily replied in the summer that the IAEA had “enough material to have questions.”
The Syrians very quickly got rid of the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly cleared the ground.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial vendors in the moments just after the attack, which must have greater informational value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always implied that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after particle analysis.
Since then, Damaskus has refused to argue about it, as well as about satellite imagery.
In addition, controllers are prohibited from a second inspection at el-Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel is also keeping a strict silence.
“We will never comment,” Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "is progressively transformed into a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally there is a serious breach against the treaty of non-proliferation of atomic weapons, for which the IAEA watches.
The IAEA considers three more equipments as the key to progress in enlightenment, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
The inspectors have not yet made public what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariyah as interns, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
Possibly located at or immediately next to a military base, Syria forbids entry to the three sites to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that Syrians fear a record that the US has requested the IAEA to spy on military plants.
The nuclear detectives were alert about the equipment thanks to the warnings of the U.S. Secret Service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three sites and the cube on the banks of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high office in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production."
But there is “no sign of any sensitive activities”, nor of uranium enrichment or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is driven with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
As the hundreds of loads of trucks disappeared from the ground, no one has any information about where the debris remains.
The IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometers from el-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as an area for radioactive waste, to be unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in a satellite imagery analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that the Syrians made land movements at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly dispels suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has taken a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which the Syrians allowed, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, which is why the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, has carried out the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option that I am open to in the future", but he still hesitates.
This path is very risky: This requires most of the IAEA’s governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: "And what if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her still unnamed debut.
She has written the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Not much is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women’s associations have protested quickly, moving some planned filming days in Sarajevo to Hungary at the last minute.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women’s organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the UN High Commissioner’s ambassador for refugees.
He is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
No love stories are given in the rape camps, and Jolie's position on the matter betrays the victims enough about the script.
Her organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended the dismissal of Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, granted it after a strip and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie didn’t go anyway.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she enters with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its content is still inaccurate.
A second synopsis of the film circulates on the network that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim falls in love with torturer".
Jolie’s movie really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
They can currently make peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish.
No trace of grief
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans scream with joy as loud music resounds, pounding the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the South-Dutch Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this bizarre drinking game and the understated computer actually don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, distracted by the fulminant question, what the future will hold.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will hold a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, “with one shot she got the job of her dreams as an event manager, maybe it’s a good sign,” says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in London.
The young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, economic experts and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin predict.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, there is a migratory wave comparable to that suffered by the island in the eighties.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses above all the young, well-trained Irish, for whom until now, everything is uphill.
The job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, will go and lose our country and with it an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a bleak future appear because the government is only engaged in montages and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They cut minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies for getting new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
Observe how your peers go from unrecommended practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
“For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to directing your career,” says the manager.
His website features photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but involves freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
They are now building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he will go to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only rarely because he works overtime to pay off a loan for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a little crazy,” he says, as it’s been a long time since he first stepped on the threshold of his house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with careful gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears today.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by much difference, as dramatic as in times spent here on the island,” he said.
“Working abroad for a season is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe we feel like Irish for the first time.”
He laughs and tells of his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Let go of the future and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He already worked in London for a couple of years, and why wouldn’t he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him greatly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he might degenerate into a farewell party.
“Only not too many emotions,” she says and gives a big drink to her beer.
"Farewell, sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a walking party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as well as support for private companies.
Crime is of greater concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows for monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries along the South American Pacific coast (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a sharp decline in output last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted their country ' s Congress and 45 per cent their Government, the same number as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been sustained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only marginally increased in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
About 31 percent say they or a close relative have been victims of crime in the past year, down from 38 percent last year and the lowest percentage since 1995.
The more positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela say the same (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the most leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same number as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections in the Garbage
No one expected the November 28 general election in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they happened in a much worse way than was feared by foreigners trying to help the country recover from its problems.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted several times, ballots were thrown into the sewers, electoral colleges were destroyed and acts of intimidation were carried out.
Electoral colleges opened hours late.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, declared that they were “relatively good elections in many ways.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautioned that “we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tiebreaker is expected to take place in January.
All hope for the elections has not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has barely any support, if he has any, has moved on to the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic is sweeping the country and more than one million earthquake survivors are still living in tents, a large abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an essential step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And, as has become clear, so do the Haitians themselves.
Proceeding from tips towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernandez, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public who has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite everything, whether she can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s election will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez puts aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following Kirchner’s death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have clashed with Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
The 2010 budget, therefore, will be applied to next year, which will give the President even more room for action when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the trade unions, place it near 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who came to power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had the INDEC, the statistical institute, adjust official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez now moderate these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18 percent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum for growth achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about 6.7 billion dollars.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF oversight, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to elaborate a new index of domestic consumer prices, which seems the prelude to the cleanup of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernandez wants to remain in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has grown weary of Kirchnerism.
When Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have waned.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, with peace of mind, many of her husband’s policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of those eligible, flocked on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become an advocate of feelings for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest shift in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has leaned toward full independence from Taiwan, won nearly 50 percent of all votes against 45 percent of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s vote share has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the town halls.
In the election you could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy field trucks and large crowds with flags and light girls in dancing clothes.
Nor was the mysterious attempt at murder of rigor lacking.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean toward the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not dealt with.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing and job creation plans.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China’s military threat.
Consequently, the KMT often avoids publicizing its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time too, the PDP avoided encouraging anti-China sentiment.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma stated that it had been confirmed that his policy with respect to China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue bribing them with trade, in line with its strategy to get Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
It would certainly like to achieve political integration as well, but the first thing is the first.
It is best to wait for the 2012 presidential election to pass.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on charges of corruption.
Between 2000 and 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PDP candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything it can to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans to set up a group of experts to act as a point of contact between the PDP and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “reliable alternative” to Mr. Ma’s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said the PDP candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intercession, the PPD will have a hard time choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also do a conscientious examination.
Mr. Ma’s assessments have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says it will restructure its cabinet as well as local teams.
Large samples from the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Revelation Artist.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of this year’s Grammys surprises with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Revelation Artist.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives no reason to think, but respects the Grammys' rules that an artist must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly represented a breakthrough and, given his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as great skill with pop, funk and Latin rhythm influences, one can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the path to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have lately focused on the jazz scene.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity,” an exciting and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a shrill New Orleans favorite and regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans considerably towards fusion as on the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Wild Darcy punk James Argue's Secret Society earned a well-deserved recognition in the big band category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-dangerous Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Classical Album Direction
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, five movements, and Steve Mackey for "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic three-movement orchestra.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his No. 4 symphony, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories spanning orchestra, opera, choral and solo albums.
The classic producer of the year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
Nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium S of the Art" and "Sacrificium S of the Art"
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Theatre" by the orchestras.
Grammy-nominated composers for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatemente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for him to play in Avi Avital mandolin, who performed the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the ordination commission
The mosque project for Temecula has won the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, members of the commission decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically stunning.
“Many good people came to show their support, whether Christians or Jews or Baha’is, from all religions,” Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
“The truth is, as an American citizen, I’m proud of myself.”
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
“They only speak very loudly.”
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time was dedicated to people interceding for or against the center, virtually the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“The United States no longer exists,” reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near zone zero, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a property shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it a very peculiar thing, although it's not far from being a really 'alien' type of life form," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
It has long been considered that there are six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on different planets of Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know how it looks.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery “shows is that in other planetary environments, there may be organisms that use other elements to drive their biochemistry and that the set of “standard” elements we consider indispensable for life may not be as fixed,” said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the investigation team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," added Cockell.
The discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's astrobiology institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one with the other.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.”
“Therefore, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them.”
“However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, so to speak, it crams the biochemical machinery,” Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to ever-increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they were able to adapt to and use to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but demonstrating that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that an arsenic-using form of life may naturally exist, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example to prove that it works had never been found.
Arsenic was more common in the early ages of Earth, he said, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
“It does suggest that there might be other means of generating life, not just the way life formed on Earth in ancient times,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton
The two missing dogs have been found from the four stolen in front of the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's officials said Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck they were spending the night in, in front of Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met Wednesday evening, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
“The good news is that the dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
"They have returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found for comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's aides found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit at local competitions this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were to be exhibited in other competitions planned for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly two-month tour of participating in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs (a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany), who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van Tuesday at 6 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while MGM’s restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to clear approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and television shows.
Thursday’s ruling confirms the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal hurdles for MGM to revive under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a small studio.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In reality, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The process of restructuring the firm began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to sort out its finances, while struggling to make interest payments worth $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron Chairman and bankruptcy recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial woes and satisfy the study’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted a few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion the creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, the Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for its management services, will receive “successful fees” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production on MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and gathered an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on “The Hobbit,” along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to make a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of its gift budget
While the iPad is the top contender for being this year’s most wonderful toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant nick in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys they could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even slightly less compared to last year’s.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best-known of their kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys powered by button batteries are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are guinea pig-sized stuffed toys that sing a note when their bellies are squeezed.
One squeeze equals one note, and a second squeeze begins to assemble a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start to squeeze, you can’t stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift-shifting games like Sim<0xC3><0xB3>n Dice, and can make the lunar leap, thanks to its innovative wheeled articulated feet with locking device.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you're a kid from the '80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question letters designed to turn a car ride into a session with an intriguing self-correcting exercise booklet.
If you are wary of giving your child your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60, ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games don’t teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, ages 3 to 12), it’s the first major set-up of the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter display.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot for viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and up) is a set of five blocks just larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to assemble words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it’s formidable for an improvised word-assembly competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, ages 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of button-battery-powered microrobots.

A more moderate side of law enforcement in China is being promoted
As an urban trainer sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, the burly policemen of China’s urban order, feared and despised for their whimsical strenuous measures and inclination to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Stand firm!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls who barely spent their teenage years wearing white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on top of the hair tied with blue and white striped bows.
“Personally, I think they have a normal appearance,” Mr. Tang said, disdainfully.
"The models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a ragged snack cart, and watched it with constantly frowning for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his belongings and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s minimal respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat a passerby to death after using his cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and posted on the internet, describing it as effectively whipping criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street vendor suffered brain damage after a quarrel with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded “really meticulous cleaning.”
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if the women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features."
They should have a height above average, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
“His image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament “and the inner qualities.”
Female chengguans are like vases, he said, adding, "in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to back up that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese labor notices for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not show up.
“We can’t allow a person or a humpback to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his colored cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent in her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His dimpled co-worker, Xu Yang, 21, said “Our work must present the image of the city.”
They also don’t oppose their fixed-term job, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply chasing out salespeople in the alleys where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces roughly a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many buns or tofu bowls as possible before they are thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn cart with noodle garnishes.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is pretty much the same every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his spare time.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, mutinied after the false rumor spread that chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen police or Chengguan officers were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were tipped over or set on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike screamed rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the bad-faced officers made way for the elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men’s squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned over to hide his name.
As female officers, coordinators, men 40 and older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said with total naturalness.
“Most of the time it’s the audience that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not bring charges against Senator Ensign
The senator’s attorneys announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said it was "surely happy" with the decision, which came after a full-year investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign’s attorneys said the Justice Department had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plan to bring charges against him on this issue.”
The Department of Justice declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, get lucrative work through lobbying, to silence Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator’s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was barred under law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to drop the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, amid charges of procedural misconduct.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s top lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins declined to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a job through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him he was “crushing” the Home Office on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the Transportation Secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department’s lead and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire's appeal to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the courtroom rows.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the appalling testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut, family, is set to come to an official end, with the imposition of the death penalty judge voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ attorneys have filed papers in court outlining the arguments for appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports about the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appellate judges to grapple with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“Based on what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual’s rights to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, senior defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
Trial Judge Jon C. Blue of the State Superior Court laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media was “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was carried away by passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that coverage of celebrity cases can raise questions about the fairness of a process.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the TV show and the movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the way of communication from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defense attorneys say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge improperly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They noted in a rebuttal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually threw firewood into the fire of emotion about the case.
"The daily agglomeration of tweets from the media, cameras and reporters out of court," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps across the state."
His attention to Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly, was a ludic vision that would make the court’s policy on coverage control weak in future prosecutions.
But some lawyers said appeals courts were often drawn to arguments about adaptation that were required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction because of the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would require that the new media would require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century.”
Can civility build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, a bit of civility has been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of genuine bipartisan cooperation in the future or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone says, it was at least a courteous discussion about the differences of the two sides, as well as an acknowledgement of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to earn partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit commission was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a trial period, probing each other to identify signs of cooperativeness and compromise, as they try to assess the limits of public opinion and voters’ patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent evaluations of the same by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep-seated to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed with respect to the way things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which then go extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts are due at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can’t make them believe they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich by denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues at the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it was very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement would begin.
“After the things that need to be done are done, in the short term psychology will revert the situation to a confrontational one,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civility can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The motives have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and nullify the new health care law.
Those lines of support are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit commission ' s recommendations, which include reform of the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting costs.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they’ve been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that in tax matters there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between Republicans in the White House and those in Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and healthcare, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would bring about the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch closely the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks they are losing will likely change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a paradise of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a “kleptocracy,” and it leaves some of the bribes and protection money it raises directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service were reported to operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called “vertical authority,” takes its part as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt, he claimed, “It’s crazy, a hoax, a nuisance.”
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do that.
“The Moscow city government’s direct links to crime have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional,’ and to claim that the government functions more as a kleptocracy than as a government,” the statement said.
“The criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term from the criminal and mafia world that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that goes through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
“Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow’s criminal world.”
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are at the second level."
“Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS raises money from larger companies, and that police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s commercial owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the money collection is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed by one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably filled with cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats,” Georgy Satarov, director of Indem’s Moscow expert group, said in a recent interview.
“But he’s a part of this bureaucracy.”
“He doesn’t belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from at least to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur until late Moscow time, will surely cause displeasure within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we don’t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure, and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a weakly lit concrete classroom with stained and peeled walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School remembered the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-sustained loyalty is finally being challenged at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations-Cambodia court issued the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the notorious torture center Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can do nothing,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
“To them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“This is creating divisions within families.”
During the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their arms, the low-ranking soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
“These people have made little profit after the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
“They were raised without any concept to do business.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine,” he said.
"Ta Mok fed them all."
“But now life is hard because we have to self-supply.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute the top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases other than those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
During a recent embarrassing afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden piles on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to speak of his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She said that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” he said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, though experts and historians question it.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
“Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is reuniting the broken pieces,” he said.
“It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the high school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s link to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the roadside, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
“But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him,” he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot’s last break, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations with Belarus were carried out in the past two months, to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday’s agreement to remove the remaining material, about 227 kilograms, according to an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit presided over by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This shows that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal was "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have conserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-grade uranium) and low-enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material ... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching a deal.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been lightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the research facility for low-enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that “this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen trust” that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will seek to remove its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential detente.
While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.
The Spanish government has not reprimanded the CIA flights.
The Spanish government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo by Spanish territory, the U.S. ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by Wikileaks to the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, where it is added that the then first vice president of the Government, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, asked the Spanish Executive to be informed in order "to be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance on foreign planes passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries of complicity in anti-human rights practices, including Spain, a meeting took place between former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Government of Zapatero out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no concerns about intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “caught unsuspectingly,” Aguirre recounts on a cable.
The then foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited capacity for influence."
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez told the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
“These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information,” the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the “apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors”, rather than the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007 at a lunch between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba told him that "although Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do whatever they deem appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP’s action in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” he said.
The confessed parricide complained in the network of the "agobio" of being a mother
The young woman was talking about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror a la gallega"
Monica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she used since she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the Aru<0xC3><0xB1>a people from which she comes.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician, 30 years old, began a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Tunez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him have the DNA test.
It was not long before another boyfriend met him.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even came to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance was fractured, that they broke.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very weird and muskete, because I have come to work."
"When I told him it seemed good, but of course, he now realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do whatever he wants."
Then, he talks about a message to the cell phone he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child to you."
She complains, "If you don't like me leaving the kid with my mother, I'll pick him up when he gets back," she says.
In May, he talks about returning to his village: "This week I'm going to stop there, but I'll only be until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to present myself to a job so as not to lose it."
He clarifies that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"He will be with whom he owes, that is, with me, and never in life will I think of leaving him again with anyone other than my mother," he said.
In July, there is another post.
When you type it, the boy, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly killed on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
“On the one hand he’s with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand he’s going to class almost every day.”
Talk about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He's going to go there to some summer classes, and I'll save myself some babysitter pasta."
The 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck."
The 30, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
Of Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money."
On the internet there are messages of yours in blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he called himself "Muki the ex-prisoner."
"Terror to the Galician (ep<0xC3><0xAD>graphe)".
The last man who lived with her, a jury guard, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that it all happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial penitentiary of Palma yesterday, coming from the center of judicial detainees of Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "nor having intended to cause any harm to the minor."
Before, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has its sights set on the general elections because, whether advance or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles the number that it receives in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the regional elections of 2006, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, which has been fed by a transfer of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would verify that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a deputy - it now has three - while ICV would stay with a deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar remains, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relay at the head of the Diputaci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages more budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popular agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can take the lead in the overthrow in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has been placed only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the General Information Commissariat of the Police in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter of the bombings in Bombay.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with “Operation Kampai” the apparatus of falsification of Al Qaeda has been “weakened” at the international level and, “therefore, its operational capacity”.
The researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were counterfeited and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal Al Qaeda galaxy so that its “combatants” can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The decommissioned cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the coming days on the territory of the EU are carried out strikes similar to the one developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was developed in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistanis Zesanjr the Sihar and Muhammad the Athar Butt.
These were the ones who headed from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network – part of which was hit in 2009 – mainly stole passports from tourists that met the requirements of the so-called “World Islamic Front”.
That is, the documents had to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
In the media of the investigation it is underlined that, at the moment, no data has been found that links those arrested in Catalonia to the bombing of Bombay, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", has been one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency some thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
The PP demands that More park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already proposed during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispense with pro-sovereignist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to propose in the ecuador.
The president of the popular Catalans went to meet Artur Mas with the certainty that gives to have obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to be wanted, since the CiU candidate needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the investiture vote.
From a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the talks that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investiture "all sovereignist and independentist speeches will have to be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the converging leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Catalan Solidarity).
The geriatrics claim that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their caretaker killed more than 11 elderly
The heads of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage that has caused to the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while he was there employed killed at least eleven elders in his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, the lawyer Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible".
In addition to the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the caretaker, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that is already being calculated by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by phone.
Caritat, through its director, strongly denied yesterday this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what has happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is not a single indication that there has been a reckless action by anyone other than the accused himself."
He confessed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by pinching an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by using a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center has access to medicines.
The insulin punctures and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his quest to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the caretaker, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that it is higher, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the courthouse and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say they are making themselves available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet’s threat yesterday that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral spreads have closed strongly and European banks’ shares have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that, just as it collapses, recovers but is motivated by the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose his fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and they will have to be retracted tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded to finalize the public debt purchase plan for ineffective and to eliminate all extraordinary measures of liquidity in the future and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and keep the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond-buying program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As at their May meeting in which they claimed they had not even contemplated buying bonds and collapsed markets, tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
Treasury only issued $500 million at 5.28%, versus $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to raise private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are bearable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension ahead of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity by presenting yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment sound in the ears of investors like the four stations of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been fast and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Aid Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available triple that in March, at very expensive rates and closes you access to the markets sine die.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar’s wife, “in addition to being so, so appearing.”
Come on, we can.
The president of Eulen will contest the junta of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm does not stop in the open conflict in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "full-fledged nullity", the judicial board of El Enebro next day 16, requested by five of its seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the signature holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services to the company does not seem willing to yield in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was overridden by five of his seven sons who were appointed directors at the shareholders’ meeting on January 18 of this year and whose challenge is noted in the Mercantile Registry.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunder in the bosom of the Alvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the board.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a “desperate recourse of the applicants their five children to, through procedural wits, clear fraud of Law and abuse of right, try to validate and heal the radically null junta of January 18,” according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the Board, once the meeting is held, to proceed with its challenge as it considers it to be "null and void in its own right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez’s seven sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group, however, claims usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge once the hearing on the appeal is held, for which there is no date yet set.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
Software designs improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one considered the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final stretch of the championship everyone bet on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without undermining the skill of the driver of the German champion Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that powers his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from the high car competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computing instrument has been used to design assembly lines from manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable failures and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements during each season.
Today, the Red Bull team employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all the elements of Red Bull’s bolides with the exception of the engine, which is the entire responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation to this technologically advanced madness is the $40 million each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolides in a locality about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered “high secret.”
The squad for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull’s Formula One hero, no doubt, is recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, are hidden other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and its notoriety null.
The factory’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in wagon cars contributed 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology adds up to 85% of the success, while drivers contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computer science as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will reconcile this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, put as an example the remodeled shop located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom he has collaborated for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems said that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishment staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-leading pilot program that is responsible for solving possible problems with HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects to a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," remarked Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell vows to ‘steal’ 1 million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially rules out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war of liabilities.
Despite this, it foresees a fall in interest margins, which will be partly offset by increases in fees and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to attract a million private clients in three years, his pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new master plan that will be valid for three years.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share with the acquisition of one million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted-, its great outstanding subject, since until now it had pampered SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks in these times dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its master plan Optima, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made it expand one more year.
Customers who miss savings banks will be your main target.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the war on liabilities — which penalizes margins — is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and cashiers are paying for their issuances to obtain liquidity is already shifting to the price of credit to compensate for falling margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it’s going to be a pressure factor on credit.”
“We haven’t closed the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave orders to his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads -see CincoDays of 22 and 27 November-.
He also acknowledged that the trend of banking now “is to raise commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "greater sizes will be required."
“Next year everything is going to move,” he said.
He claims that capital needs are “very high” and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institution enters red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds in the face of new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through repo, cushioning the crisis.
The ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out a wave of savings bank mergers and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group can not be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14 but all the great processes have already been done and supervised by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in that too," said the manager.
Speaking during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the process of concentration is being undertaken "at the highest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the timeframes that in his day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphasized.
“Going from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion in assets volume to 17 with 75.5 billion is an unparalleled process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to meet Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The director pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banks performed very well in the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German red line
Berlin has opted to stay in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should we interpret these movements?
Let’s face it, Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about the three possible solutions to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to transgressor countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were spurring deficits, the German government pulled out of the way a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigor and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second in the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended the decision to save Greece.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were very much against the bailout of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the treaties of the Union, to make possible the salvation of a country and, at the same time, to force the private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But your proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the process of reform of the Union that will enable those measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not plan to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although we must now take measures with which he may not agree very much, from that date onwards the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency area, in which offending countries will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare themselves in default and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
Another debt- and construction-based alternative, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, is simply not going to be tolerated.
The invitation is clear.
And it would be wrong for us not to understand it.
It is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater tranquility.
And that we take advantage of the window of opportunity that we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that we must put order at home has been paved the way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn’t seem to be moving it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of leaving a monetary zone too crowded with low-income countries, can not be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and Law Fraud
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not willingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 Champions League match against Ajax has prompted ink to be written about whether or not such behavior is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which their team already clearly had won), the two players deliberately lost time in drawing faults to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
That way, and since Real Madrid will end up as the leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and can pass clean of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee has sanctioned the team’s coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and different financial amounts for the players involved.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate arising in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and that on past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds another episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit fraud of law; in fact, they are actions respectful of the sporting regulation, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that comprises the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these goods that are alluded to with fair play is to prevent the team of the offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as cheating or fraud of law, because their violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely their action tried to be the most obvious to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage do offenders gain in the intentional misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to verify that the opponent is not disadvantaged or profit is obtained in the same game, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, as the team can be eliminated at the first change, and also with this performance the players fulfill a penalty game and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension for accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go through rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor making the most of what the rules allow.
In the case at hand, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without circumventing the punishment or running away from it.
Although the border between ingenuity and fraud is blurred, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the directive to provoke them was carried out.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture the Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
Self-funded celebrations are proliferating for employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December also come back the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise as an oxygen ball for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, agree the businessmen and associations.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year's calendar (as New Year's Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean cow stage began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to do without tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Restoration Guild of Barcelona, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the employer, today, does not dare to predict what the festivities of this month will be.
"People think about it a lot before booking."
“He wants to leave but he has the alerts on the price issue,” he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and remembers that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the band around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
A survey in several central establishments found the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done our best to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
In AN Grup, which supports El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, they remain optimistic after detecting a boom in turnover since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Group sources point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends that precede the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas menu, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the boss Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that overall the reservations are "animated", although the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
Of course, the illusion for the festivities has not descended, pay who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises serious concerns in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons “at a faster rate than any other country.”
The WikiLeaks leaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by WikiLeaks confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Aside from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of U.S. diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on atomic security, rather than increasing, is “decreasing,” and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult for them to be destroyed in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for the unveiling in Washington.
This is what Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson lists in a report prior to the visit of then National Security Adviser James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and a reason to keep guard.
“Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The most novel of the documentation leaked by Julian Assange’s portal is the ever-decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan’s high pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy statement in May, calling communication with Pakistan “frustrating,” said: “Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are discarded.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also called on Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for the head of WikiLeaks
Obama appoints a top anti-terrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol is issuing a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Interpol issued a “red alert” yesterday to “locate and track the movements” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Also, it is not new, but dates from November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
It was the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Interpol’s 188 countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange “with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.”
While Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, the organisation explained, do consider the so-called “net notice” as a way to proceed with an arrest – which must be undertaken by the national police force – especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has been willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, which they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s chief of security.
“This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains in unknown but not silent whereabouts.
On Monday, he gave an indeterminate interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the U.N. in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign,” he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request “ridiculous and absurd.”
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s spokesman’s attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with views these days proclaiming conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house in January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and prosecute anyone who gives them any contribution or help."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has had to recant after saying Assange should be “killed.”
“Obama should make him a target and use a drone or something.”
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
“Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in ERC with nods to those related to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuation.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found the recipe to overcome the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, with no north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his resignation is insufficient for the likes of former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can not at all cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will try to win the new critics with winks that allow him to armor himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC councillors will be able to pronounce on its continuity in secret.
By ballot, not by hand.
If the drivers want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said he would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand from the president more than putting his office at the disposal of militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the highest organ between congresses.
But because they do not have the majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a roadmap by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will put to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in return for promising to advance the congress to the autumn of 2011, something that the summit already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that “polyphony” harms stability and that his goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash dirty rags from doors inwards.
In this line, the article that the acting councilor Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, the head of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> assumed that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assemblyism as a mechanism of operation at once.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the management with the task of reviewing assemblyism at a specific congress of statute reform.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged addressing the issue.
Now, without critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to take it back and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the contents of MILENIO Estado de México.
Among the murders are three women and the discovery of a pair of bodies cut off in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there are 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases stands out the one of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the grace shot in the head in addition to the wired feet and hands.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street, in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
In the early morning hours of Thursday, four ejidatarios found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest, on the freeway Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the section that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl, a 50-year-old man, was killed eight times after leaving his home to start garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a bullet in the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the bonfire on the forehead, the body of a man was found on a lonely road in the Colonia El Naranjo and under the body they found a 25-caliber firearm punched cap.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the sewage channel of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the other body members, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n warned of the discovery of a corpse that was in the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada area, which was tied with his hands back and his head blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men was reported, who were wrapped in blankets and left in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the fractionation Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found dead in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a man was located in Huixquilucan that was wrapped in a yellow blanket with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os according to a message that his executors left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots to the back of the head, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman were detected tattoos of the Holy Death, as well as necklaces with his image.
In the latter part of the month, the body of a man was found aboard a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a pair of men with their heads wrapped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who do not line up."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied hands and feet, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n colony.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first of them was decapitated in the Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of the Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Next to him the agents found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at the COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, his country has invested $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China would not alter its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that regard.
He noted that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
In China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities to achieve energy-saving, energy-efficient and emission-reducing goals.
In addition, several multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, are underway or have already been completed.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and which received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private sector.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent spotlights by savers and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific advisor on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he explained, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years and expects to do the same by 2020.
Attached to legality expulsion from Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former Panista leader is entitled to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former Panista leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what suits his right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo’s protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has his right to go, if necessary, through a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez said he was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional will be strengthened by the internal election on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
“That [an alliance in 2012] is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal,” he said.
The Panista leader said that the PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; to the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he said.
He said that without a doubt the council will know how to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence he will deliver the courier "to whomever the council determines."
“I have that absolute peace of mind and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president.”
He predicted that the rebound that the party registered in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next contests, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
“For now, it’s about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task.”
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a source of observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, longings are placed on them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
Asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his four-year speech, César Nava called on Priists to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n; let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet," he said.
He opined that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag or much less censorship.
Obama promotes Twitter bill in favor of undocumented students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call on your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call on your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link to a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with senators, given that the legislation’s vote is imminent.
“With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he says.
The message came after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he hoped that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the bills.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to settle the fiscal issue before the end of the year..."
“I think we can get a deal at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a “debate-closing vote” for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted in the Senate starting next Thursday, though it is more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years and entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the bill, which requires the support of a handful of Republicans, as supporters of the bill engage in intense lobbying to ensure the bill is passed.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act require the addition of several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have said they won’t back it another time.
Another Republican he supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of Language was a walk where participants showcased the narration.
"That of Sex in the language I understand but ... the finger in the wound? what is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of his question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language).
The finger on the wound... "puts us in a bind", sweetly skewed the Argentinian writer to the public, mostly young people, who gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "wound" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which he does not get answers although he does clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectologist is convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hall, but who clarifies that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "of the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very interspersed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also exhibited a delightful narrative entitled Praise of the Invention, where the finger on the sore is not named but at one point is discovered.
With strokes of magical realism, the account of a famous sorceress, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to speak later America, the great novel that was not lacking from the beginning his own chroniclers who told it and quoted Bernal D<0xC3><0xAD>az del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what had been said.
Cervantes who invented us all made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told with imagination that was lacking to the point of modesty.
However, he stressed "it is the madmen and the deceivers who best imagine" and it is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that what is narrated belongs to one side or the other, where fiction literature reaches its apogee.
In fact, he calls it the "Cervantine tradition."
"By his inheritance we are what is counted."
In her turn, the writer Mayra Montero applauded and applauded the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the FIL gave rise with her round table The finger in the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed her way towards the great wound of social violence that runs through her country - and shares Latin America - as a result of the disputes over the trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer committed to the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
“To be masters of our thinking and masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance often means putting a finger on the wound and annoying those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and annoying also the powers that prefer a black and white world,” he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian has ended up comforting himself with the runner-up medal, has been one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santanista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he was in charge of Morelia with whom he fell 4-2 to Toluca; later, in the Clausura 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it to 3-1 and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Devils, Rubén suffered a setback, as his team ended tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he put himself in the lead by 3-1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4th vault.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same fate, seeks to break away from the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he states that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe and consequently the title will come to me, but the above is the most important thing," said the helmsman when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very current has the previous final, of which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistle the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in line, the players also, because the previous time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I think that is a teaching, until the game is over we can celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty shootouts, something that does not disturb him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to get to the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad move the fate, sometimes because of the nerves or anxiety of having the title in our hands, but we were
Romano has it in his hands to stop being a runner-up coach and taste for the first time the glory of the titles.
U.S. Changes Rules for Obtaining a Visa
Individuals should go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will be required to go to Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASCs) before their Consular Section interview.
The ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a one-time payment covering all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for petition visa cases (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because the biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this one less time than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press as presenting tomorrow a finding that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will release an astrobiological discovery on Thursday that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a news conference Thursday at 1 p.m. at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., by experts in astrobiology, described as the science responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present “a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life,” sparking speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that creatures exist on a par with us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they will become intelligent beings like humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "yes there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will unveil the true scope of the findings at Thursday’s press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Opponent 'Block' Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it leads to the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanship' in the Chamber.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, 'tronavan' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it initiates 'bipartisanship', because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panista Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms in an institutional way constitutes the political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the coming days they will talk with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and with it the opposition coalition is over.
“So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that’s what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he went on, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, now be “duopoly.”
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipathy in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are conversing with other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that at present the Congress has become a 'loot' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just one game, now they're splitting it between two."
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That not by cupular agreements, it is left out 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, now the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they did that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for "the supplier"
Mazatlan City Council pays another check to the questioned owner of an electrical equipment company.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks are still to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought, you are simply being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two from October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last, from November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, as indicated by the Law when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer said that they have not used its services again.
The above, after that on July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urge to attend tourist sites
Tourist businessmen regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to poor conditions of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and stools has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and turn to nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a company one day and have no idea what money is lost, or else they didn't do the works in this way in such a long time and without proper planning."
The hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because giving preventive maintenance and not falling only into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area should be given maintenance, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Coat of Arms and the Venadito of Mazatlan.
“Today, for the tourist to come, it does not depend solely on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions,” he said.
"Due attention has not been given and this type of fact highlights something that is notorious by all, maintenance is needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not exploited correctly and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that should be put in line in conjunction with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, tidy and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
“Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we will first have to sort, clean and put in line to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination.”
Ask for IP results from Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, president of the CCE, proposed that deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Legislature of decent work and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday the 60th legislature was installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which totals a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
“We hope that the deputies will really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to safeguard their own interests and become carnival comparsas of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions.”
That is why he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that will put forward the Governor in turn.
"We are working to make them come to do a dignified job and above all committed to society and sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation.”
As for the tourist activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight that it has within the state budget to strengthen the state Secretary of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that directly competes with the agribusiness industry."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for detonating tourism projects that help in giving security to the state and in updating the Alcohol Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
We are looking for a magic king.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next Kings Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the Colonia Salvador Allende and live by the day because the father does not have a fixed job.
“Well sometimes we find it hard because my husband has no chamba, but we sell mandarin and potato ... already in the afternoon I go out with the ‘plebes’ to sell on the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said 'let's see son', because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, 11, is size 12, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, 10, is size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears size 8.
José Juan, 14 years old, lacks tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the Seeking a Wizard campaign by donating a toy or cash at the Northwest Reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment destined for production have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have come after a lengthy investigation that has lasted nearly a year.
“It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to carry out the arrests,” Mr. Ruel said.
Approximately 70 officers from the Quebec Security Investigation Unit, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in the operation.
Fight against illegal migration without problems
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should solve the problem of illegal migrant hauls, will surely face strong opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely primarily on the Charter."
“I find myself here with a party that has created the granite you step on,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow for up to a year’s detention of anyone coming from a vessel identified as transporting illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," Duceppe said.
The NPD’s immigration critique, Olivia Chow, has dismissed criticism that her party is not strong enough with illegal immigrants.
“The neo-Democrats agree that measures should be taken against those in charge of the paternal care of illegal immigrants and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35,” says Ms. Chow.
“We do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a mat.”
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” said Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request the holding of a vote so that each deputy who is going to oppose is explained to his voters.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday’s announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It must be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services held on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the Quebec party that deals with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of the chistera" and as "a last-minute fumbled solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” he says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public poll.
“The more Mr. Charest persists in avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggests Quebec grant a special mandate to the Comptroller General to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Comptroller General," he concludes.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews has confirmed that his justice counterpart Rob Nicholson is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa pushed for the adoption of the Gangster Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landslide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
Sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations add to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday evening, Quebec’s Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and of Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has led to some lakes being cleared at Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several tracks, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security unit is still on alert and monitoring the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Centre for forecasting Quebec's floods, meanwhile, on Wednesday issued announcements communicating the strong floods of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Wolf.
Partly blamed on Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding welfare and Haitians, as well as for his rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained “inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day.”
The Council has also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of People Receiving Social Assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were not correct.
Presenters should communicate reliable data that is not misleading.
In connection with the suicide, the presenter Stéphane Dupont had stated that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life ' s problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes questioned by 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Consequently, any fault has been dismissed in this regard.
The last litigation concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media confrontation that had aroused numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if the needy were actually going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
“My file has been clean for a year and a half,” the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio channel has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of greatest audience within three days.
A kung-fu king in Montreal
The Algerian-born Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance the professional level.
“In my case, I look for combat everywhere because for those who don’t enjoy playing on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and UPS employee, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championships, held Oct. 23-30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won in the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
“They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category.”
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009."
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
"San shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originally from China in which you are allowed to punch with your fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
Fights are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal must only maintain one competition in his career, he will undoubtedly attend the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
“This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China,” explains the nice guy.
“It’s like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand).
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“The one who won me is a real professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face each other in the final of their category."
“Then the champions in each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu.”
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management contract, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and provoke a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition.”
“In other words, people, instead of doing it in secret, are now doing it openly,” Quebec Party MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there was collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "with a lack of rigor."
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortia formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, this is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
Work has already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract was awarded without competition; it was a negotiation.
In addition, the consortia formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of the consortia in the technical advice sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick look at Quebec’s trade register allows us to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, namely Dessau.
Regarding the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to a particular labour dynamic and Hydro-Québec specifically responds to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
“If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher.”
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
“However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people,” Mr. Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the consortium <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the contract of <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has hinted that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well-known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is more about their leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade brands and eco-certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that advocate a more responsible consumption swarm, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this even slows down their commitment.
Even though consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates that carry the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that bear labels indicating that they are "eco-responsible", says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take the speeches of politicians on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of the information mean that 46% of consumers reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of the alleged yields of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 points out of a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the king of recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness seems to be of doors (of their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or have shared cars to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support cycling and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the recovery of the cinema complex eXcentris pos the Société Angus and the Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, agrees to cooperate, but only by means of a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, who were waiting for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to repurchase Daniel Langlois’s eXcentris film complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent and return him to his true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, be lower than the initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a $12.8 million application, but since then the applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le and Angus have until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a donation from the State must be completely discarded.
Recall that the Quebec Association of Cinema Owners and Cinema Complexes opposed direct state investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not fund real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector do demand considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has carried for ten years the burden of author cinema in its premises of the complex, after financing its own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of independent movie theaters is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The company Angus and the Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, led by Christian Yaccarini, are promoting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these venues, the Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, continues to screen films at eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th, screening Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of complex Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers the Canadians’ complex with respect to Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter’s sense of superiority toward Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, that is, during the federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the U.S. ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority virtually inherent to Canadians when it comes to dealing with everyday domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this choice: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more so, a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting.”
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the government’s survival during the February vote of confidence in the federal budget, whereby Canada will for the first time run deficits in the past decade due to a recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion,” Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to prolong parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington of the increasingly negative image conveyed by the drama series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the kidnappings for the CIA to carry out energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to host some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that he did, but that it depended "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote “he has handed over a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits have been warmed up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
In the United States they echo Mike Huckabee.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount that corresponds to virtually one-third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of concrete major projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, even better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of human GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should still be reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of compact fluorescent light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is still reduced twice as much.
Fluo-compact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
On top of that, they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent light bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not fluorescent light bulbs, but coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted on incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast looks forward to the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire, given that the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"Calls on all parties in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline of Wednesday to pass at midnight without the results being published, three days after Sunday's scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had commented on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls have multiplied worldwide for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, Gbagbo's side counts on the Constitutional Council's annulment of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the old rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign for the president of C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire, has said that the intimidation of voters carried out by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be overturned if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo’s complaints.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider the country's highest court not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has deemed the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday should have put the icing on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the political class in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote compared to 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% in continental territory (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, with 9.3% of the working population on the mainland and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available within two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOMs.
During the third trimester, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the sense of the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older people, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points both in three months and in one year), that is, 482,000 people over 50 years, a figure that rises to 6.6% with the DOMs.
Unemployment stability has only been recorded among people aged 25-49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Since 2006, the Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social assets, embezzlement of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain itself.
On Wednesday night, they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their close associates, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done has been to take care of the landfills that he must manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to lawyer Simon.
As part of this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, is also being investigated since Wednesday for embezzlement of funds and complicity, but he has been released on probation and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken account of the explanations and released him," said his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) property, has been charged with “trafficking in influences and passive corruption”.
Two officials of the Aubagne agglomeration, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated for "theft and embezzlement of public property by a person dedicated to public service" and for "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds", respectively.
Lastly, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “covering up the abuse of social property.”
Among the people who have confronted Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect their societies have served to launder the capital of big banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several judicial proceedings initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations focus especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elisha has exaggerated Syria’s mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French investigator detained in Iran for “espionage”, has been holding the public in France to shame, has warned diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee has explained its strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice on managing their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman did not come in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency attempted to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage-taking cases".
The Elysee’s strategic affairs adviser, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly detained in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continually release” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate release.”
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often.”
Because, once the attempts to negotiate through discrete channels have been exhausted, “silence will not solve anything,” the Iranians are “experts in delaying maneuvers.”
Richier added that the detention of foreigners is “a usual Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail.”
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros in reward).
In addition, he points out that the Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "is going to increase".
The Iranians could “in the near future detain another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is released: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, doubts this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is surrounding Iran’s clandestine procurement networks of nuclear program material, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
To free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier guarantees that it was not so.
Elisha, he says, has not only “been enormously surprised by the judge’s decision,” but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot overturn the judicial decision", he says.
Mr. Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand is still under “close” surveillance by French intelligence services.
The Elysee counselor dials a phone number, hangs up and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee does not spare efforts, uses communiqués and organized "leaks" in the media to make it seem that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and see that the manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles convey the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials."
Why such “gratitude” to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
Next, the document addresses the reasons that have led the Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The major communication effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, which “in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been dismissed as premature and undeserved.”
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris is trying to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The aim is also to “sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to him: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
“But anyway, we thanked him.”
“At least, this should cause confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirio for playing an “active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot.”
Starting at midnight, young Koreans can’t play online
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under 16, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day."
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” Jo Rin, the ministerial head in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games when the parents of the young people request it, the official added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow limiting the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA designates the organising countries
Amid the storm of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday designated the countries hosting the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can come to take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidacies have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of their country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the bonfire on Monday as it aired a documentary that has highlighted three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the British officials, who have thrown themselves into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Head of Government hopes to re-evaluate the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had secured the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games in London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England’s brilliance to the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World Cup of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they can do is give points to Russia, which has become a heavy outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“They are bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the 1994 experience, seems to be the most logical favorite.
As the world’s leading economic powerhouse and home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of chances by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had hinted that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that it is doubtful.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the deputies of the UMP, on Tuesday evening at the Elysee, the possibility of "two mandates" has provoked some uproar.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not so much.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It simply conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he speaks of the presidential elections, with a joking tone, in meetings of this type.
“In the worst, or better, case, you’ll still be spending seven and a half years with me,” he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Do not think that I do not wonder what will come next."
His claims of yesterday do not bring him any closer to the candidacy, nor any less.
There are comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal has taken to the stage that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Quite the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to demand that the battle be organized ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and at the UMP there is no discussion on the issue," the prime minister's environment reacted immediately and prudently.
“If he thinks he can lose, he won’t be a candidate,” says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that are expected to end by the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Institute of Issuance will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be just as high.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde endorsed the ECB’s active role in resolving the debt crisis of European states.
It did not mean whether he thought the central bank should do more, such as increasing its government bond purchase program.
“I reserve my opinion for my European colleagues.”
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more eloquent in terms of his intentions, indicating only that the program of buying State Letters in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" during the meeting Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of treasury bonds doubled last week to around €1.35 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet operators of the market, yesterday he would have bought again Irish and Portuguese bonds.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased €67 billion of securities since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that purchases will continue (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant change of course.
Although more than three-month lending operations have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity on beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I don't think it's going to significantly modify your program."
“If not, it would run the risk of triggering new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 will occur," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds in order for the market to remain stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
“It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked increase in yields paid by the most fragile states,” said a senior bond manager.
Because, if interest rates are put in the clouds, states will have even more trouble reducing their indebtedness, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government caps the storm
After Italy started the week disturbingly, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
Following a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "indecipherable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of the hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing some turmoil in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi said that in Spain the difference with the German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" about "turbulence in the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the euro zone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have meant a jug of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures must be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
“The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are in good shape, as we have been saying for some time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, neither in the short term nor in the long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, n.d.l.), the stabilisation efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries," said OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan.
There remains the problem of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, there would be an inconvenient period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to fight the crisis
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already shown on Sunday night and day that Europeans are clearly solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although it was relative, yesterday’s easing in European state bond rates has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
Rating agency Standard & Poor's announced it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target for speculation today.
“Like in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems,” say the economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets.”
Aware of this gap and the dangers it holds, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing mechanisms for resolving the crisis.
Informal consultations between finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on track.
And this is also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, started a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly paves the way.
The first issuances of EFSF bonds are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the front-line countries, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
They both want to avoid seeking international assistance at all costs before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they deem indispensable to build confidence on a lasting basis.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, finally, consider the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the public bond markets.
Passing through Paris, on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a front-line player in the European public debt market, consider that an amount of around an additional 100 billion euros would suffice, “preferably” in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently endowed with EUR 60 billion.
A council that, without a doubt, could examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects northern Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly in <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Lower Normandy, <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France and Limousin.
Snowfall is strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, Météo France warns.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited for heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles.
According to the gendarmes, the movement in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that you do not drive except in case of need and the movement of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
On Thursday, school transportation in Picardy was banned.
No specific measures had been envisaged on Wednesday night to limit the circulation of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro of the Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France has reached its peak, it has rained billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the metro of the Grand Paris that the Société du Grand Paris must build.
To start this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4 billion euros.
Theoretically, this sum will subsequently enable the GSP to obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, we finally have the first accounts.
The 2010 amending finance law, examined in the National Assembly’s finance commission this morning, contains the devices envisaged to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of an equipment excise tax and the increase of the tax on offices in the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of an existing office tax "to modernize it, increase its output and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's far from $4 billion.
"It is specified that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that will be mobilized by the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanatory memorandum.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
“From the moment income is created, we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the $4 billion later, as we explained.”
“It will be recorded in the budget and used as needed.”
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised $4 billion is not included in the credit, can provoke a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi’s sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for novelties about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as the head of the secret services (if he could not be, what do I know, editor of Libération) is lazy (or has little anxiety), who considers only what he can recognize to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi sent by the U.S. embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as published in the Newsweek the week before.
So why have the revelations in these files caused such turmoil?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of State can call each other over the phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have been transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows it perfectly, we just pretend we don’t know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image to American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world considerably affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "victims".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, one could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power can escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power endure that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without a secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power from her.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and a lot, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any confidential information on the net, as it would be like publishing it on a poster in the street.
But it’s also clear that with today’s technologies, you can’t expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has flown in and contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is a matter of science fiction and, therefore, novelty, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly on stagecoaches with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at most, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I’ve written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a telegraph with (telephone) wires.
Video (analog) tapes had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, uncovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) only allow moving forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travels it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was being secretly plotted in the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s hoodlums in its funding pledges
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked funding pledges (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been met.
And the French hoods have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best cards to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its member states, a press conference, a large complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparency was an appreciable operation and appreciated for what it really was worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010 which puts it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what “new and additional” means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" for the year 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France’s aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while claiming to respect its commitment to “new and additional” funds.
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each one chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that every euro borrowed is equivalent to one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to reducing emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that is going to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be counted for its commitments.
But France does not find such a reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see it for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to stocks over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early funding is a minutiae, relatively short-term, in relation to the whole of the climate negotiations.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could advance the debates on the stakes in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter that is currently being debated): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additional character” and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move the negotiations forward.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the ancient movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value considering the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that usually consume a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These model meals, which comply with official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three parts of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
“Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumers’ exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is of concern,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most “nutritive” with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk these “pollutant cocktails” pose to consumers is “probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "confronting the gravity of the situation" to implement a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
