Spectacular "wingsuit" jump over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination with wings), it passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many people had gathered to observe its feat.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners are struggling to find the money needed to repair crumbling highway infrastructure, many are seeing a solution in the form of a small black box that sticks above your car’s dashboard.
The devices, which record all miles traveled by a motorist and pass on the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and government offices to revamp the outdated system of financing major U.S. roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of major axis planning suddenly provoked a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby for the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you are traveling, and eventually the road you are traveling on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The tea party is over.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are unable to agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles driven.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental ride.
This is truly essential for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, general manager of the Southern California Association of Governments, which predicts the state will begin recording miles traveled by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans aren’t buying as much gas as they used to.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gas tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently had trackers installed on 500 cars to test a mileage payment system.
“This turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage usage fee.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to city liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in ways that reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also saw it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Reason’s free market supporters also appreciate the idea of charging drivers per mile.
“It’s not just a tax going into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transportation Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the mileage payment route.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have targeted about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or the city.
However, several states and large cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the most important experience in the country.
These motorists will soon pay the state mileage charges instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is attempting a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their slightest actions.
“Anxieties about Big Brother and things like that are a big deal,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
This is not something that people want.
At the start of the trial, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location devices."
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily comings and goings.
Nevada is among the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to the states.
It sought to break through into the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices it is testing have pleased the planners of the main axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
“People will be more likely to do that if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, general manager of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive ways and far less intrusive methods of proceeding.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxation device that would also be equipped to pay for parking fees, provide “pay-to-driving” insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," said a city planning paper.
However, some transportation planners are wondering if the whole mileage debate isn't just a huge diversion.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very simply handle the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four unreleased in listening
The English musician hasn’t finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, released in January, he concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unreleased.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone in a state of turmoil.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he stated that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dated 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to spark the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke are planning to reissue the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three albums: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously released clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe Edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces both each of the records, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very forward and a skillfully mastered rock electricity.
Unpublished already in listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a light ride that gradually slows down to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John’s Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The bewitching guitar riffs make you want to leave Earth.
Bowie is having fun playing chameleon with these titles: turn informant, man on board a rocket, martian potential...
He hides and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, including with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the Louis Vuitton L'Invitation au Voyage campaign, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not briefly released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers prior to their return to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the military were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released before they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel – who do not meet the army’s “universal service” rule requiring staff to be able to perform a range of tasks – to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist in London, Ontario, with PTSD, was released from the army despite his request to stay for another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case came after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the universality rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the military has struggled to determine what latitude it can grant to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but are unfit for combat.
Under current rules, severely injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year to Parliament indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal veterans spokesman Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Disney Is Going To Tablets To Launch An Animated Series
American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to prioritize tablets over its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie’s Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its worldwide launch on the Disney group's channels is not scheduled until 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, aimed at children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the pussy Callie, sheriff of a city in the American west where she makes order reign with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms,” he added.
A survey released earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in mobile device use by young children in the U.S.: 38% of under-2s have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of under-8s, compared to 10% and 38%, respectively, two years ago.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for U.S. intelligence services, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter he presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Snowden said: “While the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he believed that support from the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will make it possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been put to a severe test following complaints that the NSA had wiretapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign intelligence services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States,” one should take advantage of it.
German Green MP Ströbele posted a photo of himself with Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Ströbele said that according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he was the subject of a “serious and sustained” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have deemed the disclosure of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public utility.
The letter makes an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the on-demand video service Netflix via their TV in a future that doesn’t seem so far away.
The Cogeco subsidiary said Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary beta testing of the platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,” Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus follows in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, although the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have a precise date with respect to this new platform.
"We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail," Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable carriers to make its service available through their streaming platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for pay-per-view services.
"It's been about two and a half years since we've said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy major channel packages doesn't work," Audet said.
However, he hoped that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"There will need to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy with respect to television," said Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the earnings side, Cogeco reported net income of $43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82<0xC2><0xA2> per share.
This is a decline from net earnings of $44.9 million, or 83<0xC2><0xA2> per share, from the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline with depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired Atlantic Broadband, a US-based cable company, for $1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90<0xC2><0xA2> per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93<0xC2><0xA2> per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is up 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned that the number of clients will fluctuate in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with intense competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat has been spotted in cans of beef products, sold by two small UK retail outlets at low prices, the food hygiene agency said today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA up to 1 to 5%.
“As horse meat is not mentioned in the ingredient list, it should not have been present in the product,” the agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products believed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles left four injured early Friday on Route 131, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Shortly before 4am, a motorist who was driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that was coming in the other direction.
All four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal around 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them on the descent of the plane.
The new hand luggage fee applies to bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fee in advance.
“We don’t want to charge that price,” she explained.
Airlines began charging for first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges would put as much stuff as they could into the hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in these compartments.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees will not really be used to raise money.
It’s about making Frontier’s most loyal customers understand that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and check-in procedures are changing to ensure passengers are aware of these charges before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s hand baggage charges will not apply until the summer, although no dates have been set.
Passengers often groan about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that the costs of handling luggage are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them did not pay for luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand luggage fee three years ago, and low-cost carrier Allegiant followed suit a little later.
The only other airline imposing such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the surcharge fees.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit’s hand baggage charges earned $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate as passengers discovered the unusual hand luggage charges imposed by the airline.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career,” he said.
I expected to see grinding teeth and a fight break out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “passengers got on board at lightning speed.”
Frontier also acts as Spirit and charges a $2 fee for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said passengers who drink a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who drink coffee can be reserved free of charge.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008 but backtracked seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airlines followed.
Frontier’s decision to charge hand baggage fees when passengers do not purchase their tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half the loyalty miles to customers who purchased their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced mileage premiums by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown of Denver, but her business declines and she loses money.
Revenue fell 9% and its flight capacity declined nearly 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to straighten out Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls an “internal error” and not hackers for the failure of its site
The shadowy National Security Agency said Friday that it was a bug that had caused its public site to crash for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service (DSD) attack are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in jeopardy, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber-tactics are not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The once top-secret NSA, once dubbed the “No Such Agency,” has come under fire and been heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications surveillance programs at home and abroad – part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the agency and leaked by former NSA consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked much speculation that tonight’s incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, and employees were met individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” says Félix Bisson, regional director of labour relations at Delta Hotels.
The closure of the Delta is taking place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either it reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
“Or he was selling it to someone else and that’s what happened,” says Paul Arsenault, who holds the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a seniors’ residence.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will be launched within two years.
CEO of Titan: "Goodyear Amiens acquisition project starts with zero employees"
After throwing the towel with a bang in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear site in Amiens-Nord promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tire manufacturer Titan, today declares himself ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that counts the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it, Monday, October 21.
After giving up the plant purchase project in January, you come back today.
You had uttered violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turn-of-the-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save some of the highest-paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt anyone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work 10 to 12 hours a day.
I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with a correct price and competent workers, it is worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance pay, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
Titan could then move the machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from Goodyear’s 1,200 or so current employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before he tries to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all employees.
There will no longer be any employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to secure those 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we give guarantees of duration of employment when there are no employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier profit down as aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and aircraft deliveries during the third quarter and contractual issues in its Trains division.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also failed to provide in-flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule by September.
After the test plane's maiden flight about a month and a half ago, it flew only three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results did not live up to expectations and the share price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from “superperformance” to “sector performance” due to the low potential for the stock market to rise in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has so far been modest at 177. It appears that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is confident that Bombardier will achieve its 300 firm orders target before the first aircraft enters commercial service.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing according to schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's downtime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and provide an update period, and that's what we did.
This will happen again throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
Yet analysts are skeptical that the first customer could fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the timeline for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.

Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, down from 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics division was $32.9 billion at September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and overall market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Aeronautics revenues fell 13% to $2 billion.

Two speleologists aged 23 and 27 have been missing in a chasm under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, it was learned Friday at the Speleo aide de l'Is<0xC3><0xA8>re.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one experienced in practice and the other not, had left underground Thursday around 9:30 pm to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We hadn’t heard from them since then, the same source said.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to Speleo aide in charge of the relief organization.
Dozens of people on site
About twenty rescuers, ten civilians members of the French Speleo relief, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on the scene.
Late Friday afternoon, the two cavers were located.
"This is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambéry, were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They got lost in the network, went back in their footsteps while waiting for help, the prefecture said.
Refueled, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of first responders in the evening.
German journalists asked to flee Google and Yahoo
The union of German journalists on Thursday called on its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo in the aftermath of new revelations about the activities of US and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using search engines and messaging from Google and Yahoo until further notice,” she said in a statement.
She said the Washington Post reports that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
“The research done by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,” said Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
Fireworks repainted: MP calls for Brigitte Grouwels to resign
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' plan to "relift" the traffic light poles in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the center of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 poles of traffic lights of the region in the colors yellow and blue of Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all the Brussels traffic lights, at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content with spending Brussels citizens' money madly on re-lifting the signal posts in the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her operations of flandering the capital," De Bock said in a statement.
After her black-mango-yellow taxis, she finally repainted the Brussels poles herself in dark-blue-yellow-black.
According to the MP, there is now "no difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
Brusselsers deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who carries out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan Horse of Flanders.
"As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of Brussels!", concludes De Bock.
the Portico of Pont-de-Buis
The Pont-de-Buis ecotax portico, around which a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived at the scene shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national road was diverted in the wake.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the prefecture of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re Wednesday, has been taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax porticoes in the department of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers who own a prototype of Google's connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a headphone, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of micro-fibers or an in-ear headphone.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale commercialization date has yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father left the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid of forgetting it or rather I didn’t know how I was going to continue to “date” it.
There is no recipe, no instructions for how to cross the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle wake-up call in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, lying on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle with cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found his body empty, crumpled on that hospital bed with the crumpled sheets.
Likewise, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the meager glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, by small appearances during the day or at night, a little shy, a little erased, it quickly returned to my mind, evolving as it regained its place in the landscape of my thought that believed it to be in mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost the person of my mother at all but simply a woman I did not really know, a woman who embodied this person, during his stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This detour of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside as well as outside" he seems.
I've always been told that.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he became old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I had pain...
He talked to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He gave me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are gone, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to them: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it is too late, only there is always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing that moment.
I often wake up in anguish when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and fit into my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I would wake up, hoist myself out of bed, my father would wait for me on the landing and he would smile at me and rejoice that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was happy to share what was happening to me.
And of course, there was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I take pleasure in recounting this common memory lived after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother was dying of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor that I was at the time.
I realized my grief pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and taking an interest in the Middle East, to the point of becoming a master in a large school, were not, with hindsight, trivial choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I sometimes think about how she would want me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and uprightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes resting on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Died after you talked to me on the phone.
I went through all the phases: the misunderstanding, the anger, the pain, the tears that start on their own, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then, time eased the pain.
All that remained was the lack, this unanswered emptiness, this need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me in the hollow of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looking at me.
Every morning I see his worried eyes resting on me, I see the dark circles that weigh his gaze, the fine lines around the lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at age 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile again, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the middle of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a little reached.
We feel carried and protected in difficult moments, the regression of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay in the path that she had traced us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence can not take it from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated.
I could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I had problems in my work because of these beliefs.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don’t know if I’ve adopted his way of being or if I’m just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he is there on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It was almost thirty years ago that my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years old.
The immense pain that then invaded me has, of course, lessened, but it is still close to me.
Very often he "landed" in my dreams in a way so precise, so vivid that when I wake up I am even sadder to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he answered me "I'm coming down" but with a voice so real that I woke up, anguished and I turned on the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it would happen.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have a lot of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We are not telling the world to stand by us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,” Al-Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what’s happening in Iraq isn’t settled, it’s going to spread, and what’s happening in Syria is going to spread as well.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They held signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with assistance.
Cocaine Lawyer Who Informed Drug Sponsor of Police Investigation Has Been Imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Assize Court.
A top defense lawyer, who had informed a drug godfather of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after he compromised because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was dubbed “Bash” and considered by criminals to be a “case of first importance,” was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug-related trial.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Bar dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular user” of the Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought unlawfully to obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
Along with 32 other men, they were later imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, as well as over <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared his drug addiction would be exposed.
Today, in Liverpool’s Assize Court, Ditta, who works at the Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, fell into disgrace after being convicted on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer’s downfall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing 60% pure drugs under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposition, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, home of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drug, and they phoned each other nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine after tests showed traces of the class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and attempted to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home as well as at his workplace and that clients would occasionally call him home for legal reasons.
But the court heard testimony that he was calling major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “If anyone should know that the law should not be violated, they are a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being overly involved with particular clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But it went well beyond the ordinary limits of a lawyer-client relationship.
He hindered the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He got too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and said, “If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t have waited 3 p.m., I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said, "Mr. Ditta has gone from criminal lawyer to criminal himself since he started procuring drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the misconceptions of leading members of organized criminal groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information regarding police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust among the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that confidence and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was convicted of the three counts of cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecute the criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals to let them know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in trafficking heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in the trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer session on himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America, his last guest at dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin to return to the stage in December
The Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board Room at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
Franklin recorded an album in November for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering from, the famous Respect interpreter told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She said she was “happy to be back.”
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered with a mantle of light: one could approach the heat stroke in Menton with the bill of illuminations.
Invoice that, unlike many municipalities, is also settled by taxpayers, and not by trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident reportedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travelers and staff rushed to the exits or onto the tarmac.
Soon police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five vignettes imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, vignettes with a high dose of humor, we allow teenagers to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Société d'art lyrique du Royaume will return with its Destinations lyriques, a formula that now fills the Pulperie of Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the lyrical Apéro, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the soprano colorature Marie-<0xC3><0x88>ve Munger.
It was an activity-benefit, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears as an air of The Bat.
Without providing precise figures, the chairman of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to show himself reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is shaping well, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"The finances are afloat and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a milestone we will reach in seven years," he said.
"I would say even beyond," added the director general, Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey is facing six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been charged with hostage-taking, kidnapping, threats, carrying a weapon for a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and is due to appear in court on Friday.
New class action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new class action lawsuit has been filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers concerning sexual assaults reportedly taking place this time at the Saint-Joseph Oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the applicant's testimony, identified as "J. J.", which was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Submis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Oratory of Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal concerned only three establishments, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us: "I, I was in such a place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The particularity of the class action that has just been filed is that it allows the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
Currently, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of Sainte-Croix and the Oratory Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they "have been aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and committed", and have nevertheless committed "them".
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the Sainte-Croix brothers' lawyer, Me <0xC3><0x89>mile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in Superior Court.
Once the admissibility has been admitted by the Court, the second stage, namely the hearings on the merits, is carried out.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
Significant fire in a business
A fire badly damaged a business in Montreal’s LaSalle borough on the night of Thursday through Friday.
Rescue was called around 1 a.m. on Friday after a fire broke out in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Rejane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took almost an hour to control the fire.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the chief of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but close to twenty units, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested as residents of one of the apartments may need to be temporarily housed, the SIM said.
Much opposition to medical aid in dying at the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes just days after the vote in favour of the principle of the Medical Aid to Die Bill in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay home, very few would want to end their lives, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus were on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Réseau des soins palliatives du Québec also rejected the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes vice president Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked, “I want to die, give me an injection.”
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is disorienting people about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe Ontario will follow suit.
The Liberal MP for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, says the notion of end of life will have to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan Press Outrags Controversial Media Law
“It’s a frightening country and it’s legitimate to ask the question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?” the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent news and radio stations.
He said the new media court “will always be biased because it is an extension of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya’s place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it to parliamentarians,” he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have “the control over the media.” The Standard, for its part, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “had suffered a hard blow” and criticized the bill calling it “draconian”.
The passage of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping centre last September.
Kenyan media angered authorities by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly robbed the luxury mall.
The police chief, David Kimaiyo, responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to question them, although the summons was withdrawn following a lifting of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media could face fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with an additional risk of being “removed” or no longer able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize an offender's property if the offender has not paid the fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere.”
By silencing the media, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
Delivered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and reinstated their mirobolous wages of about 532,000 shillings a month tax-exempt – which are among the highest in the world.
A Difficult Year for Pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a stir in the management of the Hospital de la Cité-de-la-Santé in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmacy department found itself with a high staff deficit.
It lacked nearly 30% of the necessary staff, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time hired pharmacist.
There was no recourse to troubleshooting, Ms. Beaudet explained.
We have streamlined or scaled down some of our activities within the facility to keep things moving.
Surely we have worked hard to interest our young [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
There was a concurrence of circumstances that caused us to be in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is expected to be significantly easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three more pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain have borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
“It’s much better now,” the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
It will therefore fill our departures from last year.
Always growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of employees] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always drive on three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
Last year we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model does not start his film career through the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play young Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama depicts, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a forty-year-old addicted to sex since her teenage years.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to her eldest is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and French-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to lay naked on frosted paper will appear in situations much more sulphurous on the big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he turned to X-professionals for the boldest sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it’s the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing his actresses into their last corners, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday evening
Thursday night, the first film session was interrupted at the Méga CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following tingling in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility evacuated the room and alerted firefighters to a suspicious odor.
Approximately 70 people left the session.
The people were examined and a full acknowledgment of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on a tear gas background?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still, the cinema management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was ventilated and everything came back in order.
The cinema was able to take back its rights and the customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She is trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins.
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins into the country on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug was detected.
The cocaine had been divided into three pumpkins that had previously been emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Office of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said CBSA Spokesperson Jacqueline Roby.
What I can tell you is that she was arriving in the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montréal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1,653 seizures of narcotics.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of SA-8 short-range surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place under circumstances roughly identical to the one that took place on July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont surface-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
Rating agency Standard & Poor's on Friday lowered Ukraine's credit rating, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", sinking into the category of speculative investments.
It has a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again within a year.
“It is increasingly less likely that the government’s strategy will guarantee enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs,” the agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine’s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26 percent between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities resort to massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency considers increasingly probable a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of failing to pay a $882 million bill.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbor, furious at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after official statistics were released showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, down from less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, with a budget deficit, has been demanding for months the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it in 2010 a credit of 15.3 billion dollars and has so far released only 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranches until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, notably by raising gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF found this week that "significant external financing needs" were "a vulnerability", while noting "signs of economic improvement".
However, according to economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect an improvement in the short term."
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the expert told AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels is conditional on the release of opponent Yulia Tymoshenko.
“Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia’s reaction,” said S&P, which fears “trade restrictions” from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, has warned that if a free trade zone is created between the EU and Kiev, it should tighten its border controls on imported goods.
U.S. green light for Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objection from U.S. authorities to their merger, moving closer to creating the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiration of the review deadline for the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.
They said they also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiration of the HSR review period in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the transaction.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorizations and the approval of shareholders of both groups," they added.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would pursue M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the verge of being beaten after being driven out of the northeastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that it had been controlling since the insurgency began 20 months ago.
“We are going to prosecute M23 wherever it is hiding because they are criminals,” Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a spokesman for FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not alter his demands at the peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Clashes have been reported in the hills dominating Bunagana, the last insurgent town to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion broke out in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the escape of the government garrison and the passivity of the Monusco peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was revamped and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” Congolese business expert Jason Stearns predicted on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government has succeeded in defeating a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that any allied armed group in Rwanda would not be present in the eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, which consists of former Congolese military mutinies.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague has called on Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military reprisals after shells fell on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
“We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to one day be freed by the army,” said a resident of Uganda.
“We lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatized,” he added.
Tests conducted by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have proven negative, the health ministry said.
The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date.
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being affected after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed some 50 people.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, reported on Friday that its quarterly profit declined due to lower refining margins, while its oil and gas production rose while lagging behind the group's targets.
Its third-quarter net profit fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters estimated an average earnings per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd produced a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year, with 25% growth in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion over two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell 45% to $380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron’s main competitor, Exxon Mobil, said on Thursday that its net profit was down, despite rising oil and gas production.
Schoolchildren transport: the complaint deemed admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) has been requiring a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students who benefit from school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was required.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Ms. Lef<0xC3><0xA8>vre.
In her view, the CSRS was invited to mediate and asked for additional time to consider it.
"It is always better to talk about it, to consult and find solutions," says Ms Lef<0xC3><0xA8>vre.
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) declined to comment.
The organization has only indicated that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency rooms of the Hotel-Dieu
Faced with the slump carried out for several months by a part of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "delay the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies that can not intervene on November 4".
A request officially made "to not run any risk on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed at not hindering the campaign of the PS a few months from the municipal.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective by that date.
Even if, at the APHP, one prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of November 4, the firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual passes to the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu emergency rooms will all have been instructed to take about thirty serious cases a day to the emergency rooms of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, emergency interns will make way for five general medicine interns on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency reception service of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4th," said Loïc Capron, the president of the medical establishment commission (CME) of the APHP, which supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu.
“But we will continue to welcome emergency patients,” he said, adding that there are permanent vehicles from the SMUR on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on site, he said.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are being done gradually," Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
“The minister lied to us or she was lied to,” said emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his post as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the fronde against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "warner" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by "the medico-administrative technostructure".
“They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
“If the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem.”
They are regularly clogged.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting at the Lariboisi<0xC3><0xA8>re emergency department.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" at several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
At the ARS and APHP, we defend the "new hospital model" already launched since October 7 and which should continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to come and participate in the establishment of a "permanence of outpatient care".
"Where are we going if we ask people to self-diagnose," asks Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of emergency is not serious" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to be the same as level 3 maternity wards.
People aren’t crazy, they’re going to go where there’s the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change gears, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Santé.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP advisor of Paris and elected of the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favor of a moratorium so that there is no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, it would mark her sharp disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of deferral to other hospitals.
Obama ends IMF and World Bank wiretapping
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end its wiretapping of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said Thursday.
The decision is part of the White House's attempt to regain control of the NSA's wiretapping case after revelations by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank surveillance by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the scandal began.
Asked about the matter, a U.S. administration official replied: “The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance targeting the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington.”
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered the practice to stop in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the wiretapping of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved Thursday a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission introduced new restrictions on the data intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of that information.
UN welcomes new poverty reduction targets
The United Nations will now begin work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were established 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “overtake national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on the progress made within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concern in Mozambique grows as conflict erupts between powerful figures
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace to come back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment firm.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a t-shirt with the words "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the Independence Square of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is significant for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil’s Vale, Italy’s Eni and the United States’ Anadarko.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other's responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo, on October 17.
Assaults on former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, Renamo’s spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames the Renamo for triggering the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told French news agency AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a “loser” who wanted to use “all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.”
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to quell tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep fighting,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open university and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them knows how to negotiate well and none of them is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favor of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes collected by the Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mr Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza – who is expected to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what Renamo’s capability is, but it has conducted disruptive lightning strikes on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if the Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened government frustrations, says Fernando Lima, director of independent media company Mediacoop, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that it’s up to the president to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultan, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“No one cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "brutal force does not weigh against subtle cunning", while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "far too violent, far too outrageous, and in some cases, far too obscene to be taught in school," Crossley-Holland advocated a "mindful selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “overtly didactic” causes children to “give up completely,” with the messages being “sublimated” into pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and not said.
One fighter from Hamas’ armed wing was killed tonight and another wounded by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza have learned.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shelled by an Israeli armored vehicle.
NSA spying: U.S. 'goes too far,' Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” on espionage, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged, in Washington’s first admission in full controversy with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a U.S. government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA’s interception of communications and data in Europe.
“In some cases, I concede to you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that doesn’t happen again in the future,” Kerry said at a conference in London that he was attending from Washington on Thursday, Oct. 31 via video link.
In his relayed speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the US head of diplomacy has long justified the intelligence and intelligence-gathering practices by the necessary counter-terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and the London attacks in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since thwarted many bombing projects, through the interception of communications and the gathering of information.
“We have effectively prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to be aware of these plans upstream,” he said.
And, John Kerry told the Europeans, “I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived.”
But we strive to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far inappropriately," said the secretary of state, who had already had to speak out on the international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said Thursday night that President Obama was "determined to try to clarify and that he is reviewing these practices so that no one feels cheated."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA was intercepting data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, citing documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, says the program, dubbed “MUSCULAR,” and conducted with the NSA’s British counterpart, the GCHQ, allows the two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibers used by the internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected during the month of January alone - ranging from metadata on emails, to text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications emanating from allies of the United States and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and with leaks in the US press claiming that the US president was not aware of such wiretapping, Barack Obama refused to comment on the matter, citing national security.
On the other hand, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even returned the bullet to the European intelligence services who reportedly seized the communications, before supplying them to the NSA.
This would involve “military operations” in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and it would not target Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned Australia's ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spy network that has also sparked China's anger.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without its master asset, the Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the Ligue 1 club said in a statement.
PSG, the leader of the championship ahead of Monaco in difference of goals, has released the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from an inflammation of the left knee during his return to selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated dead
The crematorium of P<0xC3><0xA8>re Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, Socialist candidate for mayor of Paris must attend, and will then explain, at a press conference, her proposals regarding funerals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% against 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in the Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, emphasizes the "violence" that constitutes cremation, for the survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "erasure of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly experienced in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," replies Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Taming Death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To tame the cremation is for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Michaud-Nérard, director general of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as the one to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether it is religious (53%), or civilian (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want to hold a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoria have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For about ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the release of ashes," observes Mr. Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: welcome the assembly, appoint the deceased, connect him to others, evoke him, give meaning to his death, organize the farewell.
This is the case at the crematorium of P<0xC3><0xA8>re Lachaise, since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is within this framework that the P<0xC3><0xA8>re Lachaise crematorium organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of people who have been crematized in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, for the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, relocation due to rats turns to controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
Given the urgency of the situation, the director of Terres du Sud Habitat proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
There have always been rats in the cities.
The deratization company makes two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not swarm in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, one is not going to kill a child.
“We didn’t invite the rats to our house,” defends the father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon out of money and are waiting for a new home, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ends up down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The odds suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, which is detrimental to export values and the warning about its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei Index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix fell 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house preyed on by flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday at noon in Old Quebec was quickly contained.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 Hébert Street.
The flames broke out in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was contained an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it is buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the Quebec fire department.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of the stand-up in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of master of ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the audience, in the tone of conversation.
Fay’s innovation has perpetuated itself over the years, until it was picked up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play at a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to continue working with them.
This year’s event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes,” a comedy and music evening for veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Many of this year’s comedians have gone through non-traditional circuits, such as performing on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his front-page appearance in a cable sitcom (“The League” on FXX’s joyfully lascivious fantasy football theme) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate appeared on Saturday Night Live and was a cast member of Parks and Recreation, but is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, along with other young comedians with a singular voice (surrealistic pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talking with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the City Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He was telling me that when he was here, sometimes he would go down an alley between two buildings and say to himself, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here."
Oil prices continue to fall and are approaching $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns over the size of inventories offset a report showing China’s electricity-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. benchmark crude for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel late in the morning in Europe during electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies rose 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector that arrived on Friday, showing growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline not seen in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to drop to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Abortion rights challenged in Texas
A federal appeals court in Texas reinstated certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in this state and widely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The Court of Appeal's ruling means that doctors who will practice IVGs will need to have "admission privilege" with local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.
Advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law could result in an immediate closure of one-third of the state’s clinics as these clinics have failed to obtain this “privilege of admission” for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge had ruled on the eve of the law's entry into force that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, has asked the court of appeal to overturn the trial judgment that blocked law enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star made a strong comeback, on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of the audience share.
Was the show at the rendezvous?
Approximately 10,000 candidates have presented themselves to the auditions of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the perch André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of returning to their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored at this first premium.
As every year, the first audition shows brew a wide selection of budding singers, for the better and sometimes for the worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Luckily, a few have found their way.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of a successful singer are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
Court Blocks NYPD Control and Search Policy Decision
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge’s decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department’s control and search program and dropped the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the outcome of the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the constitution following the implementation of its program to control and question citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on the suspension request on Tuesday.
The appeals court said the judge must be divested of the case because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to court criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by mistakenly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their control and search program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy reform, training and oversight, and ordered a pilot program to test body cameras in neighborhoods with the highest number of controls.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose case is dismissed after a police check.
The hearing of the city's appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The control and search tactics have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of recorded checks has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its all-time high in 2011 with 684,330 checks that mainly concerned black and Hispanic men.
A legal action was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and has become a collective action.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD’s control and search program say they will end unfair practices, create more effective and trusted police forces, and change the way police departments use the policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without lowering crime, represent a waste of money, and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers have been sharply reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that she was not ending the control and search practices, which are constitutional, but that she was reforming the way the NYPD was implementing its controls.
Tenants must go to vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of housing that goes into taxes to the City.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We can no longer afford $100,000 in fireworks, $4 million to $5 million in land for...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysee
Entered the 500 m2 of Elysian kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the ranks until becoming a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their vacation spots, and fed countless of the world’s greats in a quasi-anonymity that he breaks only today, at the time of retirement, at 60.
The man with an open face, unclothed skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 in the Ferté-Saint-Aubin holds a CAP of pastry.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I went from one castle to another!", says Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manias of the six presidents for whom he served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
“It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus,” he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysee!
Not displeased with heads of state who showed a relative indifference to terrestrial food, "they are all greedy", denounces kindly Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, who restored the cheese, "he is someone who likes to eat" and "there is not much that he does not like".
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially at the state dinners at the Elysee: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchens of the Elysee, who had a drink Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch in his heart.
He said praise.
“His human side has come out,” he says.
The head will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysee for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec on Friday noon.
The building of four dwellings, located at 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three alarms to the fire department.
The fire broke out in the front, but rose on all three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Quebec City Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid response of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this sector of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The burning house housed four dwellings, but no tenants were on the scene at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers have dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: The Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget about being reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will decoy you in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells the true story of a “Long Island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a vast Wall Street corruption case.”
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort set up a scam that would make him a very rich man.
The opportunity to follow its incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains the parties, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excess of any kind are the key words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seem to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long assembly.
It seems that the film finally lasts 2h45.
On the 25th of December, he will be able to participate in the Oscar race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm a fake tip on a liaison involving then-Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was having a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his “pretty special counsel.”
It was reported to the court that the newspaper had instructed Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and "permanently plant in front of her door," but Coulson also called her and left her voicemails.
“The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stand in front of people’s homes hoping to surprise them, he’s the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they say about it,” Edis said.
He said NotW used three means to investigate the topics: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Is he aware of phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say, “Of course we do.”
Rumors of an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's editorial office when a source, feeling a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said she was told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, on which hacked voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire’s home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the period the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
In the meantime, former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former Reporter James Weatherup have overseen the oversight of Miss Pawlby's slightest actions.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson’s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking the phone.
Barack Obama welcomes Iraqi Prime Minister, in full bloom of violence
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki is expected to receive U.S. assistance in fighting the largest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures released Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN reports an even higher death toll with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
The violence is increasingly deadly despite heightened security measures and large-scale military operations launched months ago by the Shiite-dominated government of Nuri Al Maliki.
The total death toll in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
Approximately two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence raises fears of a new flare-up as neighboring Syria is in the grip of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot dead in the streets or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, which complains of being politically marginalized and the target of unjust arrests, has fostered this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, the day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars bombed north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), an al-Qaida-affiliated group (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a “global war” against al-Qaida.
The violence is at the center of U.S. Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki's talks, which will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and the elected members of Congress.
On Thursday, he pleaded for the international community to wage a “third world war” against al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uyghur group of Tiananmen attack
China's Homeland Security chief on Friday accused a group of Uyghur separatists in Xinjiang of being behind the car bombing that killed five people in central Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, crashed into the crowd that stood on the famous square of the Chinese capital, symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement in eastern Turkestan of instigating the attack.
Many Uyghurs, a Turkish-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there animated by independence demands.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.
"The group that was standing behind the scenes was the Islamic movement in eastern Turkestan," he added, his remarks being echoed by the news agency China News.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uyghur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident left 42 people injured.
The Islamic movement in East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probes contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a major worldwide survey on how parishes handle sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests take care of gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The poll was sent in mid-October at each national bishops’ conference, with the instruction to get as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as a major gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how to properly probe parishioners.
In the UK, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: army attacks last rebel stronghold
The irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred fighters, were entrenched at an altitude of almost 2,000 meters on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," a Jomba resident told AFP, who was reached by phone at around 12:30 p.m. and said a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a bit," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels back a bit."
According to the witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before climbing to the front for a "harvesting operation".
He was clearly heard behind him crackling with small arms.
From Bunagana, the political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear detonations of heavy weapons.
According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase", with FARDC having "encircled the residual M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since Friday's resumption of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, MONUSCO has not been directly involved in the fighting, but has provided key intelligence, observation and planning support to government troops.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well-supplied with ammunition, were climbing towards the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, a border crossing with Uganda, soldiers helped by civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to ensure the succession of another craft pounding the positions of the M23 on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila once again called on the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" on Wednesday night or be disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December with no result at the moment.
On the ground, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it remains only for the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born from a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the movement back to the DRC that had started in the morning reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we crossed over to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back, told AFP.
We have the impression that the shots are getting closer to the people.
In the early evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, that beast of a scene
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the sung and danced productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical is asserting itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart's rock opera, most attempts were caught in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables bore the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as hit hits.
The first takes up, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next the worldwide creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other stages, musical performances such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" put themselves on the tune of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Stories of musicals" and lecturer at the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre du Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard won.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First, there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to the producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true history as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year leap backwards under the pretext that you can serve just about anything when you have Matt Pokora at the head of the bill.
Then we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes variety Anglo-Saxon musicals by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects like “Rent,” “Spider Woman’s Kiss,” or “Spring Awakening” are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough capable performers like on Broadway to sing, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musicals, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
Jobs are numerous among regional theaters, tours, Broadway, the off-Broadway...
The pool of talent is as large as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre intended for adults and not young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
It is these same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show, is the assurance of an infatuation of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are expertly maintained by professionals who answer the questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
Mayonnaise was raised in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
Seriously injured in crash with ghost driver in Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning at around 5:30 am, in the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the scene of the accident, as long as the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, did not cause traffic jams as the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore be deflected by this exit/entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured at an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at an attraction at Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares new assault
Children play on a charred armored car that belonged to the M23 rebels, in Kibumba, on October 31, 2013, in the eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The objective is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on its own.
Only Runyonyi Hill will remain.
"Chanzu's is not very strategic," North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
A political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23, are cut off at almost 2,000 meters of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the neighboring town of Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day said the situation had been "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot and three others were injured, including one seriously, evacuated by FARDC, the witness said.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and the rebels on October 25, the two belligerents have not reported any casualties.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a fine day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, at low altitude.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media said the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation prompted an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence services, again insisted in September that the U.S. is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower-turned-consultant, began unveiling his inexhaustible treasure trove of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on his word.
Reports, according to which the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked corporate paranoia over state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that overflowed the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence and business transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data should be used in their mutual interest.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the United States poses as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents released by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on trade secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them.
“This is not the right way to go,” says Hasso Plattner, president of German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Anything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations have been a shock to some companies that previously thought China posed the biggest surveillance risk.
A big change is happening in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data held in the United States is governed under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-U.S. members have given up their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations about the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers are asking us today a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where are my data kept and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
“This has been a recurring theme for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Managing Director of chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to disclose the prevention measures they have put in place, in case it would leave the advantage to an adversary.
Big companies have long been pounding the message that it’s unwise to pick up a free USB stick at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of car manufacturer Audi, says that collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during their travels abroad due to the risk of harm to the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their trade secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV warned in a report.
The United States is alerting its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty to the second degree of having carried out acts of piracy of economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of France’s internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found in a wrestling mat rolled up in his high school gymnasium, believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found Jan. 11 stuck in a rug leaning upright behind the rungs of his high school gymnasium.
Investigators for the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office have concluded that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old’s family disputes those findings.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it defies logic, the laws of physics, and common sense,” Crump said.
They are convinced that these conclusions were given for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a briefcase and we gave him back to them in a tomb bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I consider there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated Johnson had died from “positional asphyxiation.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence that would justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office representative was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to hand over all video surveillance footage that investigators had examined.
The teen's parents said they hoped the video footage would contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes school-based advice on childhood allergies
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize teachers and staff to food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends schools have a stockpile of epinephrine – the EpiPen branded auto-injector being the most commonly used – so they can react quickly in case of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “I feel like something stings my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “I have tingling on my tongue.”
NSA case highlights total lack of intelligence debate
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which, on the one hand, offends itself in public by summoning the US ambassador on October 21, and on the other, prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande telephones Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is the extent of U.S. surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart, on the one hand, the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the NSA’s listening to the Quai d’Orsay?
Wouldn't there be some kind of vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allow each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on U.S. diplomacy’s analysis of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in the light of U.S. power, this is an important illumination.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way indignant about this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Did France benefit from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Is it possible to deprive the US of cooperation?
The implementation of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States, in particular, have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information on a quasi-daily basis, which are described on both sides as essential.
As an example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the means of the NSA.
France may be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data about the Sahel region to US services, and in return - it has been said before - the Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the underlying issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to have interception tools, but the issue of the total absence of prior debate, especially in parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope that should be theirs, and, ultimately, the issue of violations of freedoms.
What are the real dangers of the United States? a deterioration of its image?
I don’t know how they will be punished, but I don’t see how they will be punished.
The risk to Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies – and this has been the case recently – learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest level of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US providers subject to US laws, and therefore to the control of the NSA.
Lastly, the vast movement of revelations by media outlets around the world, which helps spark a debate about intelligence surveillance practices that had hitherto been virtually non-existent, could prompt lawmakers, including the United States, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children may choose “indeterminate sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly assigned to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to enter an “indeterminate” or “unspecified” sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person reportedly said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'll remain the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and scrambled.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersex being part of the group of 60 diseases diagnosed as sexual developmental disorders, a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to attribute it, then wait and follow the child’s psychological and physical development before considering surgery, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York who specializes in sexual identification issues, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It’s like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, (such as muscle mass, hairiness, chest and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the scale of harassment and violence and prejudiced crimes.
Young boys of non-conforming gender now have camps specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as “neutral” after winning her appeal trial that allowed her to keep an “unspecified” sex for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this largely Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from schoolbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are toppled."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be assigned to babies at birth.
“The parenting role is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely a decade ago, the medical community viewed the genre as a slate, which can be erased and redrawn.
But now, many are questioning the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his or her sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we would not call the psychiatrist, we would call the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered gender malleable.
He enshrined the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a poor circumcision to have him castrated entirely, also removing his testicles, and to raise him like a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “always repeat this pattern.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations say “[that] they are not satisfied with the result.”
Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors couldn’t really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual developmental disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he champions the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites labeling and stigmatization.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an ‘indeterminate’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female gender, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be recognized as a third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
The German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should lead at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a sexual developmental disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said German law will “take responsibility” for parents and children.
Dr. Baratz’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
“The law leaves some latitude to parents so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This gives them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a delay before registering "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with – and that’s something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes his government will hold out until 2015 despite strong left-right tensions in the ruling coalition ahead of the Senate vote to oust Silvio Berlusconi from office.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he "strongly intends" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former president of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, declares his impeachment.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 by his refusal to yield to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters called to the scene said they had responded to a call saying there were "multiple injuries".
“The security forces are on the scene,” the airport said on its Twitter account, as television footage showed people being evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed one person being evacuated on a stretcher, and a second person being transported in a wheelchair.
The incident occurred at about 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 in Montreal) at the airport's Terminal 3, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that spires 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to immediately confirm whether any of his employees were injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire killed an Islamist Palestinian Hamas militant on Thursday and seriously wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip, health service sources said.
A Hamas source said fighting broke out in the region as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Jewish state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama’s campaign seen as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event in the highly anticipated 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times obtained a copy of the book and reported Thursday night that the president’s close associates had conducted “in-depth group work and polls in late 2011” to see if Biden’s ouster could help Obama toward re-election as his hopes waned.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the vice president by former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within the Chicago Field HQ and within the Oval Office.
Only a half-dozen close advisers to the president — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was under consideration.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “does not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the paper.
Remember, at that time, the president was out of shape, and so they were like, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the review "concerted," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to find out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
“Campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on polls and focus groups unless they’re serious about taking action,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his then-boss was aware of the eventual reshuffle.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of the eventual change, the former secretary general admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama’s office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know that Biden’s removal from the presidential list was under consideration.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluorescent ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice cream.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He came up with the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” said: “It’s something incredible but we’re just getting started in terms of production, and 2g of this stuff costs about <0xC2><0xA3>200.”
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level rises and the ice starts to glow.
We tested it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary shiny effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice I’ve ever created because the luminescence of jellyfish is worth four times as much as gold.
Each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes pretty good!
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unusual ice scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation promises to be even more ambitious.
He added: “I really want to develop an invisible ice.”
It's intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to do it.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for residents of the town of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his musician’s hands splitting the air,” writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer’s wife also said she had promised her husband the week before he died to take him out of the hospital and to take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are city dwellers, it is our spiritual home.
“Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of life that he had,” she added.
Lou Reed underwent a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I became more sluggish.
In the last two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I will certainly not do it more this year.
But the stats show that I'm the gallant sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans — 158 million of them in fact — will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is trends.
Costumes are expected to represent $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are raging.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers, and carrots.
As for the men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the men from Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my amazement, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs disguised as hotdogs.
When it comes to sweets, you don't gossip.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go candy hunting in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we are going to buy and, let’s not tell stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don’t want to eat; yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That’s about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery that I haven't figured out yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted homes in the U.S. that generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you pissing on yourself that your friends put on Facebook and you can’t take off and that a guy you love leaves a comment in the “beautiful head” style.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a lantern-shaped pumpkin is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve been doing since we were little.
Luckily for us, the “baby pumpkin trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these pumpkins and didn’t have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that slowly wither on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get more attention, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try carving their 922-pound pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an in-house bad bank with <0xC2><0xA3>38 billion of the most risky assets, a move to relax its relationship with London and accelerate its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have cleaned it up completely within three years.
RBS also said it would enter an additional <0xC2><0xA3>4 to <0xC2><0xA3>4.5 billion depreciation provision over the quarter, a handwriting related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also said that the internal restructuring would free up <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion of capital, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the “bad bank” would make it possible to draw a line on the past, with the government in particular being accused of meddling in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for the customer and for the UK,” new CEO Ross McEwan told reporters.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior features bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, the CEO of Bowler Motorsport said, “The rally fans who join Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try out different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of rallying raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 meters above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, escaped after a serious road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry
The firefighters went down the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from certain death.
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called to safely retrieve it while it was perched 15 meters above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a quarry Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit’s Denholme, West Yorkshire, quarry to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and made a call on social media sites after she disappeared into the quarry following a no-hazard accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-sighted person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and went down to rescue Ruby using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She didn’t move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate some cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical Relief Specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to get away with it unscathed.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check-up; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified watching the rescue.”
At first I didn't think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid she would fall but she didn’t move.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never fucked Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a chorister on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He screwed me when I was 18.”
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very nice.”
In a statement Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he “categorically denies having made advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Perhaps she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, “Prism,” landed at number one on the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question a Turkmen Islamic movement
“Backstage support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of East Turkestan based in Central and West Asia,” the head of Chinese security agencies told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted online Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has appointed a particular organization after Monday’s attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uyghurs from the same family in the Muslim-dominant region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with canisters of gasoline against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two people and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother were killed in the car fire.
Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, formerly China's Xinjiang, was ranked by the UN in 2002 as an al-Qaeda affiliate.
This movement is often referred to by Chinese authorities as being responsible for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Breaking up Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's wall.
While it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States spend a large part of their time bypassing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continued non-compliance with the rules would be a slight concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from the Scots.
This is a story that is not one of them.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I heard for the first time the goof that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
Yet one interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why trade the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely deadlocked.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties opposing the EU or advocating for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and arriving from nowhere, garnered nearly five million votes in the September federal elections and pulled the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the burden on national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments having excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has put a strain on its members with exchange rates favorable to German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a costly disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage freezes in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is rumbled, especially in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needed Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the French economy struggling.
As a result, Marine Le Pen’s far-right anti-European National Front party has just won a crucial by-election, putting socialists in power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically favor the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with her new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single anti-currency and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, anti-European and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will come back to something that will look more like the free “Europe of (Sovereign) Nations” favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will keep its eyes on the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels out for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate itself to a freer European agreement on the condition that we keep our own motto.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
Scotland’s SNP government is – and it is noteworthy – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Getting Older Early
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes don’t mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts think obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter’s breasts and pubic hair start to grow at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents — in general, it doesn’t indicate a rapid shift toward full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Clear signs of development, such as budging breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area, and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight advance in the age of the first menstrual periods over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years, compared to 12 3<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 years in 1970.
“Once the breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years for the first menstrual periods to appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will evolve.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered “early” when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster progress may warrant testing by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first period and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormone treatment are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with medications but recognizes that “controlling puberty can alleviate certain behavioral problems and the feeling of young girls being different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young girls to have their period.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at age 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school frightened and upset to be first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 years that linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the pubic area younger, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the PAA conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls with early puberty should be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Tribute to the Coen Brothers Folk
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémath<0xC3><0xA8>que fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise, had won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have turned their attention to the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also to the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be an accomplished musician and folk singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich tricks of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Gorgeous" for less shiny clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing goes to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells the story of the tribulations of a folk singer who fails to break through and gets angry with the whole earth.
He accepts backwards the replacements with the foot raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he toured the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a careerist but integrity, with self-destructive behavior," Coen told reporters.
If Llewyn Davis didn’t exist, the two folk music filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this New York neighborhood set to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would spawn international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk, writes.
The film then takes on the appearance of a documentary, from the dusty music label invaded by unsold 33T inhabited by an old unpayable secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character who crosses the film permanently: a beautiful red cat with a crackling look, Llewyn Davis's fortune companion.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled growing up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country.
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to “be considered good,” “chance can also kick-start someone’s career,” and “increasingly today.”
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get stuck with anything that can stop us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He never knew the word retreat.
A phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Revenge of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times called him “the author of spy novels who knew too much.”
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theater of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically diminished by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was traveling with a walker during this trip.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, claimed to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
“Without a doubt, between 120 and 150 million all countries combined,” he said in March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Foch Avenue a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, his evil eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Excluding the pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivory brought from the 130 countries surveyed to place his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a pistol or an assault rifle.
Inside, his Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, Austrian aristocrat and CIA contractor to pay for the reparations of the family castle, goes after all the villains of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 90s.
With each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
“I never pretended to be a literary author,” said Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went there and came back with real and long investigations."
The father of SAS used to say "make a kind of geopolitical soap opera".
"I am constantly keeping track of my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those from AFP, diplomats, people from the services that I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitory: thus, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he told the story in "The Damascus Road".
In "The Benghazi Fools", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadat in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the bombing.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he recounted the columns of 4X4 jihadists who were based on the Malian capital.
I am not a fortune-teller, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM daisy typewriter "whose parts were all changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page with the pen.
On the walls of his office are hung AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always well received in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said it: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age".
He will not die or retire.
No more than me.
Aircraft manufacturers quarrel about the width of seats while big orders are at stake
The dispute rages among major aeronautical manufacturers over the width of the tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow taking place this month.
The conflict is over the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers – who are not always the most courted by airlines, but to whom the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aerospace industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economy classes, but its major U.S. rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute has erupted as aircraft manufacturers look to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record number of orders at the Nov. 17-21 event.
The way the seats will be arranged in the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing says its refurbished “777X” will accommodate 406 people in economy class seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch-wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautical giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus appeals directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Would you accept that?”
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turboprop aircraft," said John Leahy, Airbus' chief commercial officer.
As eating habits change, people get bigger, but seats on airplanes haven’t changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing’s jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American’s weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average 21st-century American’s waistline is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a seating concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named "jet set" aircraft was narrower.
Airbus said it commissioned a study that said an extra inch in the width of the seats would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus’s seat width figures and says it’s not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience does not depend solely on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to get their business done,” said Kent Craver, passenger satisfaction manager at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it’s more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it’s more and more an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to order aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing are both claiming a 20 percent higher per-seat performance in their latest long-haul twin-engine models than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in unit costs is small compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to accommodate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in terms of our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Director of Passenger Comfort at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial perspective, Airbus’ proposal is driven by the 777 threat,” said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft vendors around the world even take a meter with them to check competing configurations.
While boasting comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer planes with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider side-of-the-way seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that its call to the aeronautical industry to put in place a size standard for seats will succeed, but that it could make the wave of sales of the 777X forget.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the proposed compensation for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the group's financial performance.
The vote is not binding but tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, third world fortune just hailed from the victory of his boat at the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison received a negative vote on his pay.
The Oracle boss waived a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group’s poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but it collected about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
For the full year 2013, Oracle’s net profit rose 3.5%, while the stock price jumped 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index, which rose 24% at the same time.
New Nicotine Vaccine Could Suppress Smoking Pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
More tests are needed before starting human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but finding that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track down all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from getting his dose of nicotine.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their normal activity.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated “were soothed,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have been found to be ineffective because they contain antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more in-depth research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a U.S. drone strike Friday in Pakistan, security services said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the military and the activist movement claimed this time that he had lost his life in the strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
“We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike,” a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, travelling to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state’s anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the trade lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases on Circular Quay, where the Obeid own two restaurants and a café, after their expiration in August 2005, without any tenders.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following testimony by Mr. Tripodi's former assistant general secretary, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
In the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressured for the leases to be tendered.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay's companies, which earned the Obeid about $2.5 million per year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, he acknowledged, was calling for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the trade lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but anyway, it wasn't like that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official told Fox News.
The officer did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out airstrikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a “authenticity” test
The government is currently considering the possibility of implementing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa as it plans to expand enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used to fill unskilled positions or as a diverted means of bringing family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
“The shattering statements about ‘foreigners coming back to the end of the line’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return to a time when unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of whites had to be protected – and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The working paper outlines the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the “authenticity” criterion were adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for “whether the job offer is genuine in the case where the candidate is a relationship or a personal associate of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring company”.
Companies may also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man’s frightened 9-year-old son was traveling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father’s death Wednesday from an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the UK government.
HS2 Ltd's work suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “would bring the UK together”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised upwards the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England, from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to consider strengthening rail capacity and improving travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travelling between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we face a problem of capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight to the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK government to explore options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and completing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the UK ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps.”
Rules for the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to ease regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases as long as they are in “airplane” mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision requiring U.S. carriers to do important work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to immediately change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on airplanes,” she said.
The issue is subject to regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety at all times and passengers to comply with safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has previously spoken to CASA about its intention to expand the use of its onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said it would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a review of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we truly believe that it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it is currently complying with the current rules.
“In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to immediately change that,” she said.
The FAA’s decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA’s decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can authorize passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was hectic on Pia's side where a fight involving several people broke out on the Post Office side.
At least four minor injuries would be deplorable.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore pawn lenders take advantage of middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawnshop in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping centre, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for her daughters’ tuition fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as a manager and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became this week the third pawnshop to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Pledging jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash — $1,300 from Singapore in Ms. Amirthalinga’s case — but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore pawn lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawn lenders have the advantage of not asking for credit checks or proof of pay, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawn lenders as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and household and consumer over-indebtedness.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawn lenders to bridge the gap as their economies slow down.
This week, rating agency Standard & Poor's cited rising household debt, stemming mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear Thailand’s high level of consumer debt, which has just emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the wage scale] are looking to supplement their income as much as they can,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have caused people to rush to pledge their personal belongings to reach the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items pledged in the city-state’s 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The increase is such in the pawn market that ValueMax, the operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its managing director.
The company will fund them using 60% of Singapore’s $66 million it raised this week when it launched on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have been criticized for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah says that pawning not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
“Customers mortgage assets they already own, and monetizing their personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
Plotting is becoming increasingly socially accepted as a means of securing guaranteed funding in the short term.
The people who go to the pawnbrokers are also not only those who have financial problems.
The wealthy in Singapore also go to ValueMax pawnshops to pawn gold bars or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“These may be wealthy individuals who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses who need cash to make it through a difficult path,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor Accused of Child Pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for youth in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was officiating, said it was deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, they must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and must not access the Internet.
He will appear in Halifax Provincial Court in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being kicked out
A man in a Nazi uniform barred from a cuff with a swastika was asked to leave an English supermarket, with customers complaining to the management of the establishment who called the police, the store said Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," a spokeswoman for supermarket chain Asda said.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "as soon as it arrived, he had already left without a splinter," she added.
I was standing in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were speechless.
“You don’t go out like that unless you want to get attention,” Rosina Rusin, a 60-year-old client, told the Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to disguise yourself as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I have been wearing a black SS armband twice a week for three years at Asda," Paul Dutton said, explaining that he suffered from "mental problems."
$325 million rescue plan for Tasmania’s health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout for the faltering health care system comes with strict conditions to ensure the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to end a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, high rates of chronic disease and systemic constraints.
The funding, planned for four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmania’s independent MP, Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
Additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and cataracts, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved outpatient care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that front-line clinicians believe this is the best way to treat the Tasmanian health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much “unless it is followed by real reform to consolidate Tasmania’s public health system.”
Nevertheless, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent request for assistance that he presented to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania’s public health system from the blacklist,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “fortune solution.”
“The reason we’re here is that the state Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that's taking out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that's putting in $300 million, and pretend it's a good day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no bailout dollars will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous period reconstruction, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours in lubricity or sensationalism, and that is the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narration could also become a penance for the public.
Syria Destroys Chemical Weapons Production Capacity, Surveillance Agency Says
Syria has destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the country’s civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day ahead of the
November 1 is set by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or “make unusable” all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable for destroying Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The group, which tracks the human toll through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, of which 18,678 were pro-government forces fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, an estimated 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country due to the conflict.
Assad's troops have been fighting rebels, many of whom are linked to Al-Qaeda groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting underscored the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission of ridding Syria of its toxic arsenal amid a continuing civil war within tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team was “now pleased to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all critical production declared and machines intended for mixing and filling.”
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned at this time."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of safety concerns, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to tell at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I salute the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” Ahmet Uzumcu, the organization’s director general, said in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war primarily pits Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad’s government and its security forces, which are backed by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there was a strong explosion Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger over sentencing of one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution platoon.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in making the explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass shootings in two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many.
He was also convicted of numerous other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, yet they could have demanded that the man, described as a “Demolition Man” for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, be sentenced to death.
The decision rekindled painful memories for June Corteen, a mother in Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“He should be dragged in front of the firing squad,” Corteen told the PAA.
I have to live every day without having any other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he “died” three times while on respiratory assistance.
Hugues said Patek should have known the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali’s bomb-layers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in order to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t surrender,” Corteen added.
Until recently, he was laughing at the grief he had caused other people.
The verdict was handed down on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can appeal his conviction, however.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music — but not talk on their mobile phones — under the highly anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew member training manuals and aircraft storage rules to be compliant.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the plane are closed.
They are not expected to restart them until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives the green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when the aircraft descends before landing and not turn them on again until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and grounding, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with the changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will benefit everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “room overseers” when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and text messages or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was ejected from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stowed away because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered to pose a risk.
“Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they could eventually create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile relay antennas if used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government authorize a wider use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid safety reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
New airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also better able to withstand interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only broadcast minimal transmissions when a page is turned.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for a easing of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s executives loaded a Kindle e-book reader airliner and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired mixed feelings among the members of the FAA Advisory Committee about whether or not the use of the aircraft poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots indicating that aircraft can interfere with an aircraft's systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense arrangements for travelers equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A Helitreuilly Bird From a North Sea Platform Has Been Released Into the Wild
A bird, hovering after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water raft was flown aboard a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was put back on its feet by the Scottish SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
The center’s director, Colin Seddon, said: “This ravine of water was probably a wintering migrant from northern Europe who found himself caught in the middle of strong winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help.”
The water chute was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and define what wealth and jobs creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all business sizes, sectors and regions in Britain.
The findings of the investigation will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than get bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe’s institutional arcana.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues – ranging from monopolies regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competencies should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives in favour of a treaty change and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the corporate world insists on a “significant change” that restores power to the UK.
The stakes are high – achieving a treaty change and better representing Britain’s interests would see a 16% turnaround in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate for a moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s EU membership.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will represent a significant shift in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British businesses, as the euro area embarks on a path towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means re-emphasizing trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
The United States in the Colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not departed from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he handed out treats to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were canceled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the party-goers caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the neighborhood of "Greenwich Village".
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.
We're having fun like crazy, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
That's a good kid, that's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All Saints’ Day, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller says Bulgaria’s gas pipeline ushers in a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the director of Gazprom said.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest large-scale project in Europe,” Alexei Miller, the managing director of Gazprom, said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, the country through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe transits, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director adds.
Miller added that the direct junction to EU member Bulgaria means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever.”
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is commissioned in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking information from Radio Australia.
This island, to the east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if we count three other small nearby islands.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend 95% on the generosity of London.
The Island Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836,000 km2 which correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify those 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to ensure its monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it already has to carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 EEZ of French Polynesia, neighboring Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese deputy governor
A former deputy governor of northeast China’s Jilin province was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of hitting more than 19 million yuan in bribes, official Chinese media reports.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the president of Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, the first intermediate court in Beijing said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, deeming it a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions within the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two New South Wales YMCA employees were charged with sexual assault of children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it had “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Chief Executive Officer Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children at the facility where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had knowledge of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was inaccurate, noting, “external YMCA checks have been carried out and indicated that child safety is a top priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second-worst ratings from four institutions in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord’s recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA has a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures to protect children.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including Lord being left alone with the children, keeping them private, making them sit on his knees, telling them he loved them and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was coached by Lord and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found YMCA Caringbah's Child Services Manager, Jacqui Barnat, who coached Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected the testimony of staff that they were reluctant to report these breaches to their supervisor.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord blurred their judgment, so they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his views before the New South Wales YMCA board saying that, for the organization, the lesson learned from the “Jonathan Lord incident” should not be about “reporting” by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to have confidentiality agreements signed by staff shortly after the allegations were raised was made by YMCA’s Director General for Children’s Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that the decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruiting, monitoring, initiating, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledged that his return was unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old man voiced his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to rejoin the post of prime minister, Blair would have replied, according to the London Evening Standard: “Yes, of course, but it may likely happen, so...”
When many equestrian event experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year Trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old, to win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his Shetland Toffee pony trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparables – who are of the same size – were hailed for presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side in a casual way to parade his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton has been hailed by judges for his natural training qualities uncommon for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good marks for his presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are an excellent duo.”
They presented themselves to and against all, but both snatched up the golden cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were thrilled that he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, “There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging and applauding him.”
He ran the entire length of the track and even though he seemed to be quite small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens that he takes care of.
From the way he started, he’ll surely be participating in the Horse of the Year event soon – and I’m sure he’ll be doing a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They make a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they paraded on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he really looked great.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call “will be revamped”
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be revamped, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public society.
The New Express will now undergo a “complete overhaul,” the regulator said.
The order for "redesign" came from the Guangdon administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial staff of New Express was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card".
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete redesign of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the people responsible at New Express and immediately redesign the newspaper’s management team.”
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice issued a front-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing fake stories for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to win the public’s trust,” he told public broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was chasing money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Chen’s apology, New Express posted his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on the ground.
The leak of radioactive steam detected at one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear boilers in mid-October and while the ship was at sea was "safe for sailors," but not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royal has confirmed the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, specialist in naval defense, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing boiler room.
“Everything is being done so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013,” says DCNS.
And the National Navy to certify that "this does not in any way jeopardize the program of activity of the ship" nuclear-powered.
It should be recalled that the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle is coming out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He left Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young fighter pilots.
A "small damage", limited to the confinement space of the reactor, had occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, a deluge of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs never to end.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of squandered dollars could be saved in order to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, we do not bother about the sumptuous expenses and the maintenance of lame ducks: cultural center deficit, large subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private company or demolish them.
It is also unfortunate to note the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
I do, however, give an honourable mention of the transformation of the old Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to tax payers?
It is not the public sector to invest in such companies, but the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the Fishing and Pile Lakes will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the great decline of the population, water use has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Not to mention wasting it, the city will never run out of water and the strict regulations regarding its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it’s easy to do great things with other people’s money.
I would be ashamed to stand up for such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We’ve been run for over 40 years by ties with fine grades for the most part and I don’t think a sheep farmer does worse.
Drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rails, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the 4-foot-3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging along a length equivalent to nearly six football pitches long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, United States.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge to drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard railway-equipped passageway that ran from the kitchen of a Tijuana home and went up to two San Diego warehouses.
British police issue extradition warrant for Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a “notice of surrender” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sex crime, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow him to move to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a handover notice against a 40-year-old man asking him to report to a police station on the date and time of his choice," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after revealing more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks fighting secret information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
No more passwords to enter to access his smartphone or pay for his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will be able to ascertain the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Privacy organizations are confirming this craze for biometrics, but are worried about it.
In 2011 and in France alone, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among some, and pessimism, among others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work with concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand assume a voluntary and precise gesture of people.
This is both a security - it is not possible to capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: sometimes the procedure must be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for the past 20 years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of the sensors and the computing capacity of the computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, says Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D labs in Europe.
With our help, the UK and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we’re doing research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
A unique and unfalsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Foresight at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very time-consuming and very expensive.
NEC offers forensic services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who they claim to be).
The identification has hitherto concerned the issuance of identity cards: it is necessary to compare the biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) with the information that the State has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to impersonate someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or a store.
"We collect the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of celebrities who circulate freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, who is in charge of commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Another use: take a picture of a guy queuing in a store, track his progress through facial recognition, and calculate the wait time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, presence checks have been added.
"One biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend pointing for another," explains Cyrille Bataller, from Accenture.
But, more and more, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some vending machines by inserting your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the hit of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoul<0xC3><0xAA>me by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in store with his credit card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger in a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
“If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the box 30 seconds less, that’s appreciable,” says the manager of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you customized options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
“Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people’s identities are on a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which locks if you try to move it,” says Philippe Robin, of Thales.
But, lacking in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts, however, continue to be concerned.
“Advanced facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was inflicted a <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 almond
A motorist was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the requisite caution and attention.
The seven points removed on his license led to a 6-month license withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a <0xC2><0xA3>90 fee and a <0xC2><0xA3>100 victim surcharge.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to burst the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne who, in Budget 2012, placed a 7% stamp duty on properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2M and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own properties within a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, exceeding the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, the North West and the Yorkshire and Humber region combined.
Cook said: "Following the increase in stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on high-value properties, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are undertaxed regardless of the effects of the outdated housing tax system."
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestigious real estate – the top 5-10% of real estate prices – in the thriving southwest London sector stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon rose by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London grew steadily year-on-year by 5.6% but were overshadowed by a growing “domestic market” with the city’s southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just shed light on how a dog’s tail movements are related to his mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs moved their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to see what happened to other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to other dogs’ disordered tail movements, the researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the animals’ heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented dogs with films showing other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor – and we were able to traffic the tail movement and present it as going more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw an expressionless dog wagging its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail deflecting mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn’t think dogs would deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Instead, he thinks dogs know from experience the movements they should or shouldn’t worry about.
He added: “If you repeatedly meet other dogs and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience.”
The researchers say the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs went more easily to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study.”
He said the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the different studies did not fully consider the animals in the movies or robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Although there are many elements found in different mammals that indicate that both sides of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will surely not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a concert in Glasgow after their singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was due to perform Friday in The Hydro concert hall in the city centre.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement came after the band was forced to also postpone a concert at Birmingham’s LG Arena on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone the concert at Birmingham’s LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1st.”
Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the one at the Hydro in Glasgow will take place on 21 November.
All tickets are valid for these concerts.
We apologise to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis to appoint first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest placed churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so it belongs to a group of 120 “electoral cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony at which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary for the number of cardinal electors to reach 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope had decided on his own.
“From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was “completely possible” for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we’ve never experienced such a situation – it’s totally new.
Valero said the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who will name him.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the U.S. to fix the seating case
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to fix a problem with manual tiltbacks, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the files do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is hit from the rear, the head restraint may not protect passengers properly, increasing the risk of injury,” according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The rollout of GM’s pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup truck owners of the defect during the first fortnight of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the owner's newsletter due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s stock price rose 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks early Thursday in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred at about 11 a.m., on rue Marquette, near the intersection of rue Beaubien, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been taking place at this location for some time.
An adjoining foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the construction site in order to retrieve his tools.
I was passing by in a car and saw the wall collapse with a large cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who remains close to the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We could only see part of his back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation manoeuvres were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Commission on Occupational Health and Safety has been dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The Cry of Desperation from an Obama Voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change.
He says Obama has made praiseworthy efforts thwarted by Republican Party obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I’m reading a sad book these days.
It is a book that I thought would encourage me during the sluggishness of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s the memoirs of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patients' medical records in the evening and go to bed, this book takes me back to the days when politicians inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide victory and news anchors took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades wept for joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama’s transitional period before he took office in 2008, he had 82% favorable views.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it is like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our army from Iraq, to the end of the “never seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care, and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the brink of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the drone attacks on innocent foreign children.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the wrongdoing of the government.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the exceedance of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
She can’t justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since Nixon’s administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would deliver on the promises that had been heard of for so long.
Yet, while the favorable opinion index has plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to get back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania Primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to focus on our talent,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
Five years later, Mr. President, I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescue, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of the system.
The mining tycoon, who is challenging the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has argued this argument in an attempt to rule out questions about a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
“He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a redesign of the vote-grabbing system to expedite the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why couldn't we have a system that you can enter, enter your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has explored options for e-voting and has recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties “very seriously.”
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We’re not looking for reward, except for the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, Scientific Mission Officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Environments (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
That's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
If in the past species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of classification of species.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are called into question due to advances in genetics.
In the same way, two species very close morphologically have been distinguished through genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
Ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this a discovery of importance as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a massive mortality problem caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we may be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extinction of a population of a species more widespread on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered endangered or endangered depending on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility of recovery from nearby stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the newly discovered species is derived, its stock has automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This mixing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well-known.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, only 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on the search for life on other planets than we do on marine research, and it's time for that to change.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division, according to two sources close to the matter, showing once again that the global investigation by regulators into suspected currency market manipulations is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators as part of investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expanded investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said RBS had forwarded files of emails and instant messages, sent to and from a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was allegedly suspended from his position as European head of spot trading for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of spot currency trading at Citi, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspected currency market manipulations at a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations made about bankers who allegedly agreed to manipulate rates on the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources familiar with the matter said.
Banks peel instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News of these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers for investment bank trading units in recent years, but which has been called into question this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at a low cost.”
The news came on the same day Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader working in its London Stock Exchange-traded funds office this week after it caused a loss of $6 million late last year.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was mastered,” said a Credit Suisse representative.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford has been flawed, claims a lawyer
After police confirmed they had gotten their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Clayton Ruby claimed he had never seen an investigation “so sloppy.”
Ruby told The Canadian Press that police had "ignored or downplayed" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford’s friend and occasional driver, 35-year-old Alexander Lisi, and charged him with extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court documents indicate.
Mr. Ruby called it “inexplicable” that police never searched Rob Ford’s vehicle or his home, or tapped his phone, claiming that police chief Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford’s vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search — even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Ruby's remarks an "obvious and desperate attempt" to make his case to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" for filing a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock exchanges down mid-session, except for London
With the exception of London, major European stock exchanges are down mid-session on Friday, buoyed by some disappointing company news, while Wall Street is expected to rise.
Investors remain cautious as they believe the U.S. Federal Reserve could unravel its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea spreads among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street’s futures suggest a rise in U.S. equities after two consecutive sell-offs.
At values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline of the CAC 40, led by the warning on result of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also posting declining results this morning and announcing the creation of an internal bad bank with <0xC2><0xA3>38 billion of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains ahead of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to a press report that AT&T is considering a possible OPA.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation about the evolution of the ECB’s monetary policy is going well, as evidenced by John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB’s single mandate has always been about inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week’s meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for a decline in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its retreat against the US currency and hit a two-week low of $1.3517 in the session.
These same conjectures support the euro zone bond market.
Supreme Court approves Obama's health care reform law
Great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court said today that the health care reform law ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, otherwise they will have to pay a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government’s taxation power.
The president of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page Act and found that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that Medicaid eligibility should be lowered under penalty of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All of the major Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election, including nominee Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to the soldiers and the dead of all wars on Friday afternoon.
Sheaves were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Deputy Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Israeli-Palestinian clash on Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded Thursday evening in a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory in a year.
The Gaza Strip's only power plant ceased to operate on Friday after its fuel stocks depleted, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another Hamas military wing official, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by tank shells during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred meters into the territory before withdrawing afterwards.
The clash lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell while defending the territory during a raid by the Zionist occupier on Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman said.
For its part, the Israeli military said that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, saying the purpose was to kidnap Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas fired an explosive device targeting IDF forces and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel struck an air base in northwest Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported Thursday, Oct. 31.
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but gave no details about the target.
“In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah,” he added.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing “exclusive sources” it did not name, the Saudi-owned chain said the “bombing targeted a cargo of surface-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon,” in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard Wednesday at dawn at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, relying on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous solo piano Gymnopédies by Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from ink black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre Maisonneuve, advances, in profile, thin as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple trait, takes its form.
And this shape will be that of the whole room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face uncovered, wait on either side of the playground, rush when the next handwriting appears, embody it, come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in solo relays, in group in unison (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
One thinks of "Morning Glory", where, solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, posed online in the foreground.
This is the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux’s poem, monotone and monotonous in the call, and will continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes – image-making has always been a force at Chouinard – like those hairs that are stunned or those black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet the work of Michaux, has imposed herself, with her tics.
As a result, the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’s inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a wider and giddy imaginary than dance, more porous.
Only the ending, in negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches magic.
The public liked it, the welcome was warm.
Gymnopedias, after the break, is richer.
The stage is partly draped in gray, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers take turns to play the scores.
Their clumsiness in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small solos of transitions, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffoons appear, also familiar to Chouinard, wearing the red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
The lovers are carnassiers, fugitives or players.
The gestures, the laughter and the little cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of bodies in coitus, of beings that merge.
But the piece takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored overlap, the dancers cabotage, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness perspire, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sue for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, launched an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, the company it headlined during the patent auction that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. Court of Assizes in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow advertising related to Internet search terms to be displayed, the trial findings said, which is Google's core business.
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which is fiercely competing with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel’s patents to Rockstar, Google later acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market based in part on Motorola’s patent library.
“Although failing to acquire the patents at stake during the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is claiming more damages against Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is stubborn, according to the plaintiff.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater causing the explosion
Grandmother allegedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which left two seriously injured on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, the King's deputy prosecutor said Friday night.
The expert dispatched on the spot by the prosecutor's office assures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a buildup of gas.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his partner, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU in Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge, she in a helicopter, he in an ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet, who came to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor through the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the OPCW.
Firefighters from Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
The civil protection of Crisnée stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to take oath
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he swore the oath of office to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the Court’s 18 black-robed judges whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to cheer the new president and, standing apart from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Regarded as the uncharismatic “relief wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown considerably since his victory and his speech on Friday in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Mubarak.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges in the wooden hall where he was sworn in.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by a military brass band that played the national anthem while he was on guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand..." toned by thousands of people gathered in the large amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi swore a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year began, and vowed to regain the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, dispossessed him.
But by agreeing to formally swear an oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the US has slowed the growth of the car market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal administrations weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, figures released Friday by automakers show, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
Detroit’s three major automakers posted double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales but the market was 15.3 million, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to customers of the bank, he believes that this slight brake is explained in the first place by "the government 'shutdown' and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month".
GM nevertheless reported an increase of nearly 16% in its sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by the consensus.
The group’s four brands have seen their business performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups, saw its sales increase by 14% year-on-year to 191,985 vehicles, while consensus waited for 194,301.
Fiat-controlled Chrysler, meanwhile, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, up from 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted below-consensus sales, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM was up 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford was down 1.1%.
Renault Taken to the Stock Exchange by Nissan Warning
Renault on Friday reported the biggest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor said it had cut its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20 percent, traders report.
Nissan, which had to make such a revision, also announced a reshuffle of its management.
Several traders reported that the Renault stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
“That’s clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” said a trading manager at a Paris broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two killed in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by gunshots fired by two people who were on board a motorcycle passing in front of a local neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in the western suburbs of Athens, police sources said.
The police were not in a position at the moment to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards at their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police from the counter-terrorism service rushed to the central avenue of the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes weeks after six Golden Dawn MPs, including the party's leader and founder, were charged with participating in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two Champions League games of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsed against Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a for directing a shot at Neymar, the Scottish midfielder has seen his suspension extended to three UEFA matches.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", saying its appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are deprived of electricity across the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to strong winds affecting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers plunged into the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The greater Montreal region is also experiencing its share of outages with nearly 7,000 private power homes in the metropolis and Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast upwards and expects record results thanks to holidaymakers from Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit for the full year between $325 million and $340 million before tax, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12-17% growth from the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
The CEO, Graham Turner, said Flight Centre had made 8% profit in the first half and that the second half had started strong, particularly in relation to travel other than business trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we operate are profitable, and many of them are on track to achieve record results over the entire year before interest and taxes are deducted,” he said.
This applies to Australia and the UK, which are generally the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded during the second half, offsetting a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure travel sector performed well while business customers spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was weaker and was expected to make a profit for the full year for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Strangers shoot a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Blindfolded strangers opened fire on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt on Friday without causing any casualties, as a result of an apparent quarrel with redundant employees.
The attackers fled, Interior Ministry spokesman General Abdel Latif said.
The attack comes as Egypt has received virtually no tourists since the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloodily suppresses protests by his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of the English Literature classes, students will be required to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Beginning in 2015, students will be required to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and Math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical revision.
It will make changes in other key areas next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Examinations Regulatory Office, will unveil a redesign of the structure of the GCSEs, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was a "wide consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence", insisting that the GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, with Singapore students doing about 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the deep GCSE of math – as well as the greater emphasis on subjects in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of tuition.
The program will focus more on "real-world problems", including financial mathematics.
This ruling means that a law adopted in July in that state, which calls into question the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
Eighty-year-old welcomes children with a rifle at Muy for Halloween
Minors ages 9 and 13 would go door-to-door to claim candy on Halloween.
One of the residents of the neighborhood of Muy visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old told police he was afraid.
His gun was seized.
Former Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in the Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave at the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he told the daily newspaper, drawing on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would answer one of the great riddles of the post-war era.
The German secret services, the BND, ensured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was totally wrong.
"As of August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," Tuchel said.
He was wearing a "general's uniform."
"In the left inner pocket were in particular his states of service with a photo," he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from Berlin's Mitte district town hall stating that he was buried in the neighborhood's Jewish cemetery.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormously bad taste.
“The memory of the victims is being grossly trampled on,” he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who has never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had, under his orders, Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon’s villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma from which he would bear the consequences for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” adds Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, rush to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health spending is in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Dr. Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 surgeries free of charge over the past year.
He became a physician himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they pile up in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to get to the villages that most need help.
Luck does not always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people at each visit,” said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this itinerant hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply can’t afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practices simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school, town hall or house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to leave his or her place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a tiring pace, but village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
“They’re banging on drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgeries free of charge over the past year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference for those it helps.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to bringing this traveling hospital to life and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical practices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, that finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so that he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is a learning opportunity on the ground that they do not have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help flush the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," said O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and teaching are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt about it,” said Katie O’Malley.
He gave his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not about to be extinguished.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others live happy lives by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle added.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons that push me to do this.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and situate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in amphitheatres and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but emphasizing its weakness for the traverse paths, Sciences-Po, the Hautes Etudes.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.
Heir of Fontenelle's armchair at the Académie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise?
Certainly still, but knowing that such a sacred cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which has happened.
They gladly recognized him as a great arouser, animator and federator of their work, but by noting that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The evil tongues could see there a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a keen eye and a lot of scholarship, but incurably amateurish.
The two books published by Nora two years ago have already established that the one who passed for not writing had much and well written.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
Yet, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual wandering, jubilation set to jump as if with feet joined from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the brocanteur back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive knot of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: This is an epochal concern.
Recently, we were collectively asked to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders back then, the French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is chasing is quite different.
He does not inherit an eternal franchise, he refuses to define it.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the shape of a rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
Of which this one, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so permanently settled within its borders, so formerly carpentered and solidly masonized, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are only so urgent, suggests Pierre Nora, to ward off the turmoil born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits the national history in two.
Since the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without being able to deny it; on the contrary, anxious to find its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility since it had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity felt, nothing beats the four steps outside of France, so that Pierre Nora’s American escapade could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But American sewing only makes better emphasis on what is proper to us.
There, men who had left their Ancien Régime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men cluttered with an ancient indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here it sowed drama and confit.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors whose role models are hard to model, and who have killed each other.
There is an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, like so many mistakes to catch up and attempts to resume.
The France that goes, the France that comes
Yet there was a time when the French believed they could sew together the torn dress of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
At this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity has only had a time.
Here it is again in debate, shaken by immigration of a new kind, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed in the European area.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that is leaving and the circumspect sketch of France that is coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
It is discovered that the chimney was a casanier.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessively, around the same idea.
The edge walker stood in the center of the center.
And he who had deposited, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of nation, but had evaded the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will have ended up doing it.
Certainly in a less stiff, more bursting and more subtle form.
But let us not be mistaken, equally binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Kidnapped in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defense association "Hostages of the world", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for hostages to file a complaint and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hostages du monde".
From the evening of your release, you were on the set of the 20h of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing him because it is dark - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're free," but I'm not sure, and he says we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but also very tense.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
The French take us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Easter embarks.
How did you arrive on French soil?
We're landing in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible hustle going on.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I come back and there are plenty of them.
The descent of the stairs of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my house, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull up to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little police to prevent some from climbing.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We come out of a hole and suddenly we are in the media spotlight.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to handle.
But we did the hardest.
The same night, I'm at 8:00 p.m., the next day I'm on TV too.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for a month or two that is a bit like a vacation.
How did the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing go?
I had the right to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grace the days following my return: radios, exams of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostages.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages in Niger?
I'm listening to what's being said.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I'm trying to sort things out between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the hostages of the world association that allows me to distance myself, and I think it's much more interesting to address.
I am wondering, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a semantic problem.
Hostage-taking must be described as “political” – which is the case most of the time – and the hostages must be allowed access to justice, to file a complaint and to bring their hostages before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for this.
Why shouldn’t the hostage-takers be told “you have flouted the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we are going to bring you to justice”?
It seems to me, however, founded, legitimate, struck with common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the Streets to Denounce Mursi Trial
Anger rages in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization across Egypt to demand the re-establishment of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, says this militant of the Muslim Brotherhood.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial rises a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to bring Sisi to trial, not the other way around.
Morsi must try Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses nine U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state has recognized same-sex marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to a Defense Department ID card and the benefits that come with it," the minister recalled in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he denounced, accusing those states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure that the federal law was implemented.
The slingshot of the nine states began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on the Texas National Guard settlements, due to a conflict between Texas law and the federal law on same-sex marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of same-sex marriage at about 5,600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hy<0xC3><0xA8>res
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2nd at the skate park in Hy<0xC3><0xA8>res.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are made on site Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin immediately, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the awards ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young hyeros prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At just 10 years old, he has already conquered his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he does not like anything so much as showing it to competitors who surpass him by three heads.
Toronto Mayor Chases Journalists Who Came to Interrogate Him About Drug Case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of taking drugs, according to several media outlets.
A video released to the court appears to support this suspicion.
The interested party, Rob Ford, has always denied having consumed crack, while acknowledging that he has a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he drove several journalists who came to question him from his property.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced Thursday, October 31, that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, clearly of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of people who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28," the health and agriculture ministries said in a statement.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The ministries are now calling on people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or on a skin injured by this kitten or whose animal has been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 am and 6 pm from 1 November.
“Since France has been free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free of rabies,” the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "aboriginal" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from The Gambia was recorded in 2008.
“Rage is a life-threatening disease if it is not treated in time,” the ministries recall and it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama backtracks on health care reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama yesterday came back on his unambiguous and often-repeated promise that “if you’re satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their claimants, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days by accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have health insurance that suits them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “a buzz in the news” about the terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received the notices to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better-suited health plans for the same price, or even for even less than expected.
“You’ll win,” he said.
The Administration has announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who contract their own insurance find themselves forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me address these Americans directly: You deserve better,” Sebelius said in her testimony before the U.S. Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the October launch of the online marketplace had failed "sadly".
“I’m as frustrated and irritated as anyone,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this phrase, as she believed her microphone cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her during yesterday's Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, a Republican representative from Missouri, on whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long insistently asked Ms. Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel unveils a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy Elect, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and warmth at the level of the track.
German four-time Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel wore a special helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan for free practice at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday.
Vettel chose from 1,500 drawings sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of its stable.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with a friend, and so can see the German champion up close, on the track and in his booth.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, in testing.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, destined to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Let us not be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the suburbs" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of suburbs, I speak to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
Nevertheless, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his hometown of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My proposal number one is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, today claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Activist in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if people on the right are willing to support me, I will listen to them too.
It is only extremist parties that I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program -available on the Internet- based on many themes that are supposed to speak to suburban residents and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years old, the rehabilitation of the function of building guardian...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene. "For the 2014 municipal elections, this risks being fair," he admits.
It's a matter of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven list leaders in metropolitan France and Martinique.
“And the support emails I’ve received since yesterday don’t all come from the suburbs,” he said.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedented fact, that American espionage “has gone too far inappropriately.”
John Kerry indicated a softening of the U.S. defensive attitude toward its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, espionage “has gone too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, ruled on “autopilot” when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities emerged.
The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have been aware of certain things in autopilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on 9/11."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he is now undertaking a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels deceived.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to get blown up.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did prevent planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to get to the facts in advance.
In the meantime, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the sense of frustration aroused by the National Security Agency's oversight.
“It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stand by us in mutual engagement in the fight against terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I’m going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has picked up millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some U.S. allies, however the agency’s director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding as it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations have reported documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
The director of intelligence, James Clapper, justified the spying on the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In an atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy said his office was organizing a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators are expected to be announced in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show "affectionate firmness."
He explained that European heads of state must be honest with their citizens about the kind of spying programs they have been implementing themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world doing espionage,” Murphy said.
Kerry plans to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with the resentment generated by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, driven by Shell's poor performance and a day after an announcement by the Fed that it would maintain its support for the economy as expected.
Australian woman appeals her prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 of false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the whole story.
She was detained in a local police station cell prior to the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women’s prison.
This is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“Obviously we’ve been through an anguished time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after the payment of a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to a heavier sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore its deteriorated image among tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
French police will arrest supporters of Anderlecht who came otherwise than with the buses of the RSCA
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set on Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman of the Brussels-Midi police zone, said on Friday.
Belgian RSCA fans who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system established by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Rekem border crossing to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has announced that measures have been taken to carry out arrests or even police custody," Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated a year ago a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff, to think about ways to better integrate students who live between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
The organization Vision Diversité has been walking in schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of the tribe or whether they came from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects so that they identify with all of this,” explains Vision diversity president Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support to the staff in the transformations we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he enumerates.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has created a research center that will give tools to teachers who, also sometimes, come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"Different pedagogical strategies, that is the real need," she summarizes.
The research will focus on inclusion from all its angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
