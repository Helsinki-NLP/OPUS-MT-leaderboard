Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned to "take them as puppets"
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to in English as AM, over the suggestion that they should change their name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
Debate arose over plans to change the name of the assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from all over the world are afraid of being ridiculed.
A Labour Party member said his group was concerned that the new name "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who do not know Welsh, "twp" means "dumb" and "pwp" means "poop".
A member of the party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group held an "open mind" regarding the name change, but stressed that from MWP to Muppet there was only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation held on these proposals which showed much support for the name of Parliament of Wales.
On the subject of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the option of MWP received the majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, from which she is expected to deliver the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules for disabling the MOUs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what they should be called when debating legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change in the plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
However, proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer at the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells keep silent as Harlem churches keep fighting
“The elders I spoke to said that before there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“Today, neither one nor the other.”
He said he could understand that the bars had disappeared.
“Now people are socializing in other ways,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to.”
As for churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, and "sooner or later they will return to where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the kind of people who would not help neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments from these buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, a Harlem shopping street that resisted hiring and promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building heavily damaged, but as Father Johnson's customers made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly christened the carillon as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it in another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it to the largest carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that no one occupied his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin for the last few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the organ that governs the parish and which is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing his concern that the latter "intends to pass on the costs" to the council, although the latter had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures Boy While Fishing for Lobster in California
Police said a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while fishing underwater in search of lobsters in California on the first day of that crustacean season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, at which point he swam with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only excitement to catch a lobster, but that he soon realized that he was screaming "I was working!
They got me!”
His collarbone was shattered." Hammel said he realized it when he got to the boy.
“I shouted to everyone coming out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, said at a news conference that they had seen a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the upper torso.
Officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to those of department stores full of expert assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK beauty market, which amounts to <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as sales in fashion and home products fall, the biggest runners with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will then move on to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said it would double its range of beauty products to more than 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those that can be seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup range so that most of the products are vegan-friendly, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores; the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat outlets in hundreds of stores, as it bought the two chains two years ago. This apparently bolstered grocery sales and made acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to split pharmacies' revenues into their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It was commented that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the image of our beauty runners to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel who can come to ask for advice.
Our product range is designed to fit every need and the attractive and practical locations mean we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones walked away "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for his homewear and accessories brand Truly.
His company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning anchor used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones sparking by pulling out of his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "furious" when the golden girl on television admitted during a tense meeting held Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to dedicate to the homewear and accessories brand of both, Truly.
The business came to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, and was forecast to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, turned to Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It would be his long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave surprised everyone involved in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and home textiles, and that it could further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The pair went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host on ITV’s I’m a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "We should not comment on his business affairs."
A complicated conversation "and then we'll fall in love"
He joked at the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unlike a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a statement that he was a “telenewspaper presenter.”
“I gave up nothing.”
Kim is keen to hold a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump sees as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three pounds after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at Saturday's United Nations General Assembly that the North does not see the "corresponding response" by the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he stressed, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
“Things are going well with North Korea,” he said.
“We are going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have such a good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free the hostages, and returning the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this amphitheater, we would have about 200 people around here,” Trump said.
Earthquake and tsunami devastate Indonesian island leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international help, so it is a challenge," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly endures, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not commonly found on other coasts.
Although an alert had been issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between many of Indonesia’s islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to attend to the earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia's deteriorating infrastructure, and squandered money on roads and railroads.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is affected by a huge lack of funds in the final stretch of next year’s re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative way of living the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the tie goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot at the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced towards the upper left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga jumping into the air and entering the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize ourselves, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I came up to Kante and gave him a touch without thinking too much and I just shot.”
Chelsea won 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning around near the half shift and rushing into Liverpool's field.
Kovacic built a wall in the center of the field.
He made a beautiful deep pass leading Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up on the second stick scoring with a left-handed shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool face Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the national disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped in the rubble of the buildings that collapsed with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday that caused waves of up to 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with rubble from the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Was Killed
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked people in the area who had seen or heard something to take a step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to call on anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the dashboard camera to contact us, as they might have key information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a neighbor in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was that morning.
The investigation continues while the police say they are in the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that they do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just learned that they will not be able to enter again in a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
A woman appears on the scene crying.
He kept saying, “It’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on the phone number 0800 555 111 citing the record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewrite history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by his fanatical and puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "disappearing" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
They may have sacrificed to the wrong Cromwell for the actions of their ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to be still deserving of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament under external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
Pig Killer Smashes Chinese Farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the nickname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered in blood near a cortex at Liupanshui Market in Guizhou Province.
A pig farmer is preparing to put the vaccines to the pigs in a barn on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to another adjacent cortex.
He said there was a large male in the cortex with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing almost 250 kilos, attacked the farmer to the point of killing him.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and smashed,” the cousin, nicknamed “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while police were gathering evidence on stage.
It appears that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, cases of pigs attacking humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the couple’s farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 300 kilos cornered a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "shooter.
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... they have no intention of harming.
We just have to give them the respect they need,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy, widespread rains to the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it flies over the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. ET on Sunday, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometres from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to advance north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a valley begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, toward the U.S. East Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical moisture northward, which will penetrate the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with the valley will create abundant and widespread rains in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous flash floods, flows of debris and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will approach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rain.
We strongly advise against venturing into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally gusty winds and dust.
The valley will bring locally heavy rains to parts of California's southern coast.
Total rainfall could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause minor debris flow and slippery roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spreads late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will arrive at the Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature fluctuations in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This can lead to significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the USA.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm beginning of October is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high odds of above-average temperatures for the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the trial of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate testimony of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues and the chains interrupt their usual schedule for a new last-minute Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was one hundred percent certain that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and that he had tried to remove his clothes at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people had seen it.
The company reported the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people watching TV from offices.
To get an idea, it’s an audience similar to that of a football final or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day trial, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with $3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement indicating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was picked up by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and was pounded by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator on the way to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He remained staring down for several minutes while being reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
“I stand here before you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said, "You have the power while there are many helpless women."
Flake said his office made a statement before the elevator was closed, adding that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable networks broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination before the full Senate to be put to the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee the following week, which was urging a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK prime minister accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the other side's tariffs was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect in LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a count of second-degree murder.
Officers broadcast the video of the Sims and Simpson clash and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the stage and claimed they contained Simpson’s DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to being the perpetrator of the shooting that killed Wayde.
He was charged with a bail of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner’s Office issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 forward was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "battered" and "shocked" by Wayde's passing.
“This is what worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano throws gray over Mexico City
The ashes thrown by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several rumbles and tremors.
The images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clash between Catalan separatists and police ahead of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia’s secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by riot police gleaned eggs and powder paint that created clouds of dark dust in the streets that are often overwhelmed with tourists.
There were also aftershocks later that day with the police, who used the batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “Neither forget nor forgive,” clashed with unionist protesters shouting “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received in the protest, according to local media.
Tension continues in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although turnout was low and opponents of secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was similar, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the pro-independence demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they were able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite a tight but decisive victory in the regional elections last December, this year the pro-independence Catalan parties struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or detained awaiting trial for their participation in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the demonstration in support of police with his mobile phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections the following year.
“Presenting myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car hits house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (summer time in Britain).
Police investigation inspector Bob Blemmings declared the railing and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It’s also possible that the car could have been hit at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second 18-game loss as head coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to level up after the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team is still not out of the house this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, Hearts, from which they are separated by eight points.
But before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remain undefeated in the division for the sixth straight game; the head coach, Holt, has not yet known the loss since he replaced Kenny Miler.
Livingston misses opportunities in the face of weakened visitors
Holt's team must have gotten ahead of the time they scored, as with his control they caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but his cross shot did not cross the threshold of the goal; then Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a header from Craig Halkett from the other side of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger the visitors in the ball games.
And that’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free throw and Livingston made a serve in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession but ran into an impenetrable defense that spared Ranger Liam Kelly a lot of work.
That pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Rangers ranger Allan McGregor stopped a shot from Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball off in another shot of Livingston's stopped ball.
Many cross-passes were made in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one for a hand and one for a Halkett entry to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Phänomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their upward trajectory.
His playing style and players have barely changed since returning to the top tier, but part of Holt's credit is for the way he has pushed the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, superbly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga did not give Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a breather throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's orders, this time they did not reach that level.
They missed the last pass. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. An entire call for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to fix relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan approached to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive him in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when he collides with a car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The crash comes months after another cyclist was killed in a runaway run-in on Childers Street just over a mile from Saturday's crash.
Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in the high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The riot started at HMP Long Lartin of Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. (summer time in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, in which eight inmates are implicated who are contained in a pavilion.
Officers received attention for minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff were deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be turned over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials had to go to jail to calm a riot in which staff were assaulted with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (places affected by drought could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is very likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwestern Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive the last hour of the rainy Monday.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix said in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm within a 320-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended within a radius of 64 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest National Weather Service models provide 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 on the Arizona Mogul Board.
Other areas of the Southwestern Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Basin could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with isolated totals of 100 l/m2 possible.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, the Rosa rain could be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
“According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-largest category.”
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on Mexico’s Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which will still have hurricane force on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is encountering cold water in the Pacific and is therefore losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm strength in the afternoon or on Monday night.
It could rain heavily in some areas of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of between 75 and 150 l/m2 is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 250 l/m2 possible," reports weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then continue to climb through Arizona and enter southern Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
“The main danger from Rosa or what remains of it is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the Southwestern Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause sudden waterfalls and streams of debris in deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder to find a 16-year-old boy with gunshot wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 04:00 (summer time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to Somerset police, three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area during the night.
Officers asked for the help of anyone who had a mobile phone recording of the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the meekness and anger' of the Democratic Party
“To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexually assaulting her decades ago as teenagers.
Ford also testified at trial about his indictment.
The president said on Saturday that the “Americans” that day were witnesses to Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with a record of impeccable public service,” he said.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's appointment while discussing the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
“We have five weeks to go before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t do it, but I do,” he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump has argued that the Democrats’ mission is to “oppose and hinder.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place before Friday, an aide to the Republican Party told CNN.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people had died, many of them dragged by giant waves that ripped through the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke into the luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were killed," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it devastated everything it found,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled the high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many shops and buildings destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, set at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that casualties and damage could be greater along the north coast of Palu, an area called Donggala and which is closer to the epicentre of the quake.
Communications were "totally paralyzed and there is no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, you can hear a man who is on the top floor of a building screaming frantically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people who were on the street.
In a matter of minutes, the water hits the bank carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that caused communications to be cut across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Authorities say the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees continue to urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened but only for relief purposes and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the path that the World Vision staff traveled to reach the city of Palu, where the employees hide in canvas shelters raised in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, commented Mr. Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even as the groups began the nasty task of launching disaster assistance, some complained that they were preventing foreign aid workers with great knowledge and experience from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, funds, supplies and staff from abroad can only flow if the site of the disaster is declared a national catastrophic zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the level of a province,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As long as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open up to international aid, but that time hasn’t come yet.”
As the second night in Palu fell after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of the missing clung to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that lighten the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they took a child out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which they concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel’s demolition spread among the paragliding community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, in the messages only one grey mark was shown instead of two blue marks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he added.
$26,750 stolen while reloading cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker recharging a cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
In the press release, investigating officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a cashier at the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While busy, another man "arrived running from behind Brink's servant" and stole a purse of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the stage, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identity, contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "To be formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been known by the nickname Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her attendance for “emotional reasons,” according to the show’s creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said that same year while talking about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am you, I am you, I am you.
I went from Kanye, which means the one, to Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also managed by putting on and removing the script and using the capital letters.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students approaches.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would “no longer use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities drag boys into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in AI.
According to AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, a former employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lacks a formal strategy on AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the research budget in AI would be a good start, given that other countries are far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the odds that the next AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-scoring American Othello player and was subsequently executive at Microsoft Research's Google subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotic Challenge and asked when the next one would be to help identify future visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
“It is not China that is leading academic leaders, but companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university geniuses to work on AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think they should offer residency cards to doctors in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Center that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not recorded movement for months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum if they change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece and block applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim to its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised questions about whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot in the referendum was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to gain admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would abide by the outcome of the vote and make it final.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission stated that at 1 p.m. no irregularities had been recorded.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko cast their vote for the Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country that would pave the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and put up chairs in front of tents set up for those who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our heads held high and not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said a positive outcome would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the required number.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma indicated that 57 percent of those polled planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus a vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May of the past.
Manchester City player Sergio Agüero crosses the entire Brighton defense and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling accounted for Brighton's 2-0 defence of Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the goal of the 65th minute.
The Argentinian forward received a pass in the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before heading into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He dropped one defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first touchdown to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton Ranger Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
“Aguero is going through some problems in the pe,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that’s when it happened.
We were lucky that he scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial lead in the Premier League matchup.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depth of the Brighton field in that play.
He sent a beautiful pass into the hole on the right side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several taps before driving Sterling to the opposite post.
The blues put the ball in the goal before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to party with the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there weren't many reasons to force another start.
But an always-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still knockout implications for the Rockies, who take a lead game to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the national league's Western Division.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard position with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but continue to try to close their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would be playing probably at the highest level I played this year.
“Why don’t I want to compete in this?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the starter on Sunday, but it seems they are inclined to have Scherzer throw in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his 34th start, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will likely pitch on Sunday on his usual day off.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of the outcome in the midterm elections.
“We played everything we did in November.
Five weeks to go to one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is a big, big thing... I don’t do it, but I really do, and that’s why I’m going everywhere fighting for big candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what’s happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by using whatever means necessary, evil, and pettiness.
They don’t care who they do harm, who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control and we’re never going to give it to them.”
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder.”
“And you’ve seen that for the past four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, gutted, disgusted, and liars.”
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, which received strong public accolades.
“Do you remember his answer?
Have you filtered the document?
Mmm..hey, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... It was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open.
He is not tolerant of those who express his opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, the truth is that it didn’t surprise me too much.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour MPs who are not well-received, and all for saying our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she faced anti-Semitism resolutely.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, casually issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday’s Nottingham East Labour meeting stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, Friday night committee meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "kinder and gentler" policy has long since been forgotten, if ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and it is judged whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader of the party, when comrades with whom he believed he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to portray me and adopt positions with which he would never agree, both in terms of national security and the EU’s single market.
When I speak publicly, and it doesn’t really matter what I say, there’s a tremendous uproar and attacks on social media censoring center politics, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
It doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every move of “no confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in sight.
Over the last few years I have received a lot of advice urging me to keep my head down, except to be so frank and then "everything would be fine for me".
I didn’t go into politics to do that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago while still in school, led by the neglect of the Thatcher government that had literally dropped my class, I have tried to demand better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councilor and as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East would be able to confuse my political positions and that I do not agree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who promoted Friday’s motion, the only thing I would say is that as the country walks towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don’t understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr takes the lead
It is possible that the last two attempts altered the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this pleasant match of Tenent's Premier League.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, that led the team to victory. And coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“So far we have been put to the test in our games and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "You have to admit that Ayr took advantage of the opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute rehearsal, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned to the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to get the numbers out and Jason Baggot got a wrong pitch.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the half, he turned a solo shot, leaving the score 17-5 in Ayr's favor in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stoppage due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field in a bleacher and, from the restart, Ayr advanced further through a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with an unconsumed Bruce Colvine rehearsal at the end of a period of heavy pressure.
However, the home team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for scoring Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored a try from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe had picked up the launch in the David Armstrong area and sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to get the home team's fifth rehearsal.
The protagonist of Still Game starts a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final, and it seems that Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': the interior Bolivia expects the court the way to the Pacific
The sailors were guarding a naval headquarters covered with aircraft in La Paz.
Public buildings display a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are flooded with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
“Recovering it is a duty.”
In sealess Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains alive, as does the longing to re-navigate the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the judgment of the CIX on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate the concession to Bolivia of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much at stake in Monday’s sentence.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia any reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the judgment of the CIX comes only six months after the final arguments that we have heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", affirms the Chilean expert in international law Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could be delayed.
"The issue of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined Chile’s remaining goodwill, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile", and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had been using this issue for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong said his nation would not proceed with nuclear disarmament if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart nuclear diplomacy stalled for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's "a utopia" that continued U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War will double the North.
In Washington they resist accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or cover yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the runway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that dazzled the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers brought their most amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a broad feathered flap that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories were jeweled watermelons, a magician's hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving gear, with the glasses and the tube, and others a melted ice cone.
And if you're a big fashion fan, you're in luck.
Fashion connoisseurs predict that giant hats could reach the stores.
The disproportionate hats come just after the “Bombe,” the 60-centimeter straw hat that carries everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought to the catwalk another great creation: a straw beach bag almost as large as the model dressed in a swimsuit that carries it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and topped with a white leather wing, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera's spring summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope the big hats and beach bags will hit stores next summer, as the designer had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another crop of outstanding test scores, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, that strikes him in the head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest pass rates in private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages scored outstanding.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained honorary tuition in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding score.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, languages are taking the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and of all kinds.
A survey carried out by the UK’s Commission for Employment and Training in 2014 indicated that a lack of language skills accounts for 17% of the reasons why it is difficult for employers to fill vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that require languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% spoke no foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in a language for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those in developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the languages of instruction differ according to the school.
Some schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others opt for languages considered more important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your children, private schools always have several languages to choose from and teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
We cannot deny that at the moment, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron debuts with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The team's coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the opening match of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It remains to be decided how many minutes to play.
“It will be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready,” he said.
Trump's Election Acts Arrive in Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump’s 5 scheduled mitins for next week, including stops in like-minded cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation vote paused for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, given that Republicans risk losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia followed by live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will likely address the trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct and is holding a Senate confirmation vote on hold for a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of mitins is to help Republicans face the November election with fresh momentum.
So, these five mitins that Trump will give next week are aimed at “dynamizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible ahead of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally, to be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could gather supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican Senate nominee, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
“It’s not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday’s individual matches
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a sporting concept totally invented but what athletes really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I guess we took that as a bit of a boost,” Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points advantage with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in their favor and a lot to cheer for, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each counts with three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from the tee to the green and is preaching by example.
Those guttural screams grew stronger as his round progressed, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
Getting the putt that made them win the game in the 15th, he threw a similar scream, the kind of scream that he says he believes the American team is not yet out.
“You just have to focus and worry about your game,” Spieth said.
That’s the only thing left for these players.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four of four and can not be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That route, and the way it seems to flow its energy into the crowd and from it, confirms them as rivals beat on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to achieve a victory when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he mated with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first course ended the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close by the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the ones they don’t, and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stamina to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after pulling out of the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods struggling to score four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which seeks to keep the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but could not trim the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the initial four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they fit perfectly to defeat a dislodged Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who played two games Saturday without pity or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 games in the fourballs and foursomes modalities and five straight.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning fourballs, reunited with his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and three.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They took a 2&1 win over the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There have only been two times in Ryder Cup history in which a team rebounded four points in the singles, although as the current starter of the trophy, Furyk's team only needs to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister on Saturday informed the United Nations that continued sanctions were increasing its distrust of the United States and that the country would not surrender its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps to show goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test fields and committing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we don’t see the corresponding response from the U.S.,” he added.
“Without trust in the U.S. there will be no trust in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part.”
While Ri resumed well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to "gradual" denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to “denuclearize” the Korean peninsula while Trump ensured North Korea’s security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective of coercive action, and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream for those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions aggravate our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other part of this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to a standstill."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly it was inevitable to strike the United States with North Korean missiles after “evil president” Trump called Kim “rocket man on a suicide mission.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there is still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said Wednesday that there was no deadline for that, and that “it takes two years, three or five months anyway.”
China and Russia are discussing whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Compliance with Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, just hours after North Korea denounced him for making "demands of a mafia nature".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took the “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was asking for were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and the move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University is getting all its students to sleep longer in order to combat the growth of the sexist culture of studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar has found that students at the world’s number one university often do not know the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Muller Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you only telling me this now, in my senior year?'
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basics about how acquiring good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficits affect athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know this information, just as we have a right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in spending the whole night awake still exists, he says. And he adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students that involved sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep and that you have good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, she points out. Even avoid getting fat, since lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which makes you constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across campus.
The next step, hopefully, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for going to bed, as well as for when they wake up. Likewise, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause problems sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's team intended to record their first home win since a 4–1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager, which left his team eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break, and a low-inspired Rangers lineup never gave the impression that he was tying.
While the Rangers descended to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a goal difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to deal with a head injury after supposedly launching an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that razed Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same Livingston 11 that scored a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way their organized ensemble suffocated their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first-half short pass sent Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered this great opportunity.
A powerful free kick from Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defenseman, Alan Lithgow, only managed to stab him on the second stick.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
No doubt Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have had to have kicked the penalty in the 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only made two shots at the door in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely had problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston in the 34th minute could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher snuggled the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the blood cold to pick Menga for a single shot.
Gerrard acted in the break by swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the left-hander made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team might have widened the lead in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty by getting entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTADO... was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Home: "What is this in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By wearing these earbuds, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Say, I'm sure it's popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” defective cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancers," including those of the breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump speech wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat following his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
The result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was tapped in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again hat, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white man and say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
“If I had been worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault lawsuits.
Although not aired, Chris Rock uploaded the images of West's criticism to social media.
It’s not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes due to his hat.
“They went behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I was intimidated!
And then they said that I was going to leave," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to peck?", saying that he would "wear my superman cap, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments caused squabbles in the audience at least twice and the SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, he told Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave the publication: "The entire studio was absolutely silent."
They had appointed West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people perplexed with an interpretation of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West won the support of TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR TAKING FRONT OF MAFIA"
However, a talk show host, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "being who he is and that's completely wonderful."
“Thus, I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "to be officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charges for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen translate into it seems that young people often have to be tough in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has failed" and wondered how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo (#EuTamén).
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she feels "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. What are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
It’s one of the biggest questions of our time, how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "enough horses and battlefields".
Beginning in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes his meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so she kind of provided me with my future family and my life from here on out,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly throughout parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in year-on-year terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they claim that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from Republican Party senators, “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three U.S. Republican Party senators on the legislators’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the statements were being made by “ultra-right” websites and commentators.
"Lies, lies and more infamous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, the seat of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the posts was associated with the Waters department and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie,” Waters said.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible for any way of leaking this information.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie.”
Waters' statement soon drew online criticism, including those of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial became angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“He has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It should not be challenging.
You must not question the accuser’s motives.
You have to stay calm and calm.”
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican nominee who ran to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"I'm very strong if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his department had "warned law enforcement and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that we find the culprits and that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again, Rowan Atkinson's powerless spy parody
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise from this parody and action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire become on the subject of how evidently stupid we are in the nation’s new export opportunity?
Either way, Johnny English's incompetent jump-eyed, rubber-faced character has renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, it is the silly secret agent who, despite his quirky pretensions of flattering glamour, has some Clouseau, a little bit of Mr Bean and a bit of that kind who contributed a single note on the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's now-forgotten TV commercials, in which he sowed chaos in his wake.
There are a couple of good moments in Johnny English's last outing.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval suit of armor and the rotor pitches make a brief bang against his hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when such "serious" films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if the humor was directed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s extravagant misadventures are not as ingenious or concentrated as Atkinson’s silent-movie jokes in playing the character of Bean.
Now the permanent topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker infiltrates Britain's super-secret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the distress of the agent who is on duty, an unfortunate small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the pinnacle for a pompous and conflicted prime minister, who already suffers a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can’t do much with the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since all active spies have committed themselves, she must pull someone out of retirement.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a professor at some snob institution, but gives unofficial lectures on how to become an undercover agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the academy of spies to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunite with his long-suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin from the Mistakes of Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ludicrous tricks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; they create a riot that illegally puts them aboard the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize themselves with the interior of the house of Volta.
Evidently, all the arrests come from that last sequence, but as kind and outrageous as it is, it seems taken from a children’s television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they charge for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will get the British to work four days a week, but they will pay for five days a week.
Supposedly, the party wants employers to pass on the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an extra day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "adjust" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported the four-day-a-week shifts as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits the party’s approach to balancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party does not currently support the ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week does not enter party politics and is not being considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour Party conference to bolster his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “speculators” in public service companies.
The chancellor's shadow plans also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies will not recover all their investment, as a Labour government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector companies’ shares to employees, who pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question arises as to whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw his support.
On Sunday, in an interview broadcast, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the hearing. I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the indictment came out and asked him if he had done so.
It was firm, determined, resounding.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be immovable.
“My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and I would make an explosive allegation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive lineup of acting stars and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn area, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal of ending poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the attending public had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about your goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by Global Citizen within 12 years of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to ask for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism,” people who think it makes a difference when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has logged more than 19 million “actions” from its followers, driving a set of different goals.
These actions have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and executor society that has pledged to “help children develop to their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project to reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, “It will be a long and difficult road, and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as with the great anti-apartheid and civil rights movements that precede us, we will achieve this, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to carry out a “blockade” to hamper Russia’s energy exports, the US Secretary of the Interior has announced.
“If necessary,” Washington may turn to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including those in the Middle East, US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at the behest of legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
In addition, according to the official, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability, along with the navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the U.S.
He compared Washington’s strategies for dealing with Russia and Iran, considering that, in practice, it is the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to harness and replace fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia saying that “it has only one tactic” with an economy dependent on hydrocarbons.
The statements were made while the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace that of Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was set to double the existing pipeline’s capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The U.S. stance received a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” BDI President Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Carefully Examine Her Candidacy for President in 2020, Says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully examine her presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” he said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency.”
Warren opined about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote.”
However, in a poll published Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren’s own voters do not believe he will run in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator would not run, according to a poll by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this bid.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrats in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Cites Track Palin’s Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) at Donald Trump Rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is going through, what’s going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans "returned different, hardened, wondering if there was any respect for what fellow militiamen and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy in connection with a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court-friendly report in Washington to support an asylum seeker who defies the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff of Grace's Sessions v. lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and their children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
Detained in Texas.
Attorneys in Grace-supporting states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers for the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be adjudicated according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and said prohibition violates that principle,” the court’s friendly report said.
Prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects immigrants harms the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they “provide manpower.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence by criminal organizations.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems (even all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The circumstances are very tense,” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby at the evacuation center in the downed city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their flooded belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife ask for help and then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Abuse with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper advertising the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referenced the China Daily payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what officials in the country coined in Reuters as a new phase of Washington’s growing campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in a growing trade war witnessing the levelling of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the US, China’s countervailing tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an op-ed written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was stated that China “is intensifying this harassment campaign by spreading propaganda ads in the free American press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and the press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
On the contrary, at the newspaper stand at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese may have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party.
He also claims that "one of the most important newspapers in China has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm which newspaper it was.
Kavanaugh disaster leaves Republican women's vote a few days before midterm elections
While many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite varying allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a backlash, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans positioned themselves to move forward with the vote.
“These things can’t be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) last hour for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, opponents to the "November is Coming!" flu demonstrated in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, under the control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will exceed any expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
“It’s already high,
But it will be even more so, especially among the undecided female voters of the outlying neighborhoods or those between 18 and 29 years old, who although they do not like the President, do not usually go to the polls.
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
“This has become a disaster for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the defendants' bench or not. The problem is how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between whether to believe Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of people surveyed believe Ford's testimony fully or likely, compared to 35% who support Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is more likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30% who think the same of Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her intoxicated when she was 17 years old.
In contrast, Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a college party while she was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based on Solid, the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee chanced that Inrupt's intent was "to dominate the world".
“We have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access that information.
The company describes this as “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s vision, according to its President John Bruce, is for the company to bring appropriate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to the world.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-owned security company, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to Facebook or Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would alter their business models overnight.
“We don’t need your permission.”
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based website."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
During the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Tribute to Bernard Vann, cleric decorated with the Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on 29 September 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were tasked with discovering a memorial in his honor at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, enhanced the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the feat of his grandfather that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine-gun fire".
He later rushed to the line of fire and, with "great bravery", directed the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and knocking down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was assassinated by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something he could never live with, but a lesson still."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which led the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of this genuine hero is demonstrated by the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts the roll to MMA fans at the best time
Imagine that you take all night awake to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when the best part arrives something stops you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 fights, six of which were major, and was being broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were going to see each other’s faces, viewers in the UK were stunned when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many hours awake waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these children's drawings on Twitter as "a very bad joke".
“State regulations rule that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., so it had to be switched to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said in a statement.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that they will take UK viewers into account in future programming.
“I think we can fix it when we think about repetition,” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6:00 a.m. there, we can’t fix it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
We are working to find a solution.
When the change took place, I began to receive many messages and not all of them were pleasant.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical error.
No, it was a government issue.
I promise it won’t happen again.
We will limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six. We wanted to give our fans the most, but we passed and
We have a lot of anger.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims that he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
Guest on the first broadcast of the Desert Island Discs program of Radio 4 led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began to talk about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this show, is on sick leave.
As a guest on the first show led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked boys and girls."
"To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what drove me and gave me the strength to succeed."
I wanted to prove that I was “someone” so that people would not be disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was quite a surprise".
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that 20 years of difference between them has never been a problem.
"When you live so much in such a short time" (at the age of 14 he first participated in an Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone your age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth caused Daley to completely change her perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But now I know there are far more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son were a few tickets for London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him I wouldn’t be here to fill that front row,” Daley said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that very moment, at the moment of his death, that I realized that he really wasn’t invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
The choice of the song Proud by Heather Small is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on point.

A low-form Mickelson ended up on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to improve his technique so that it does not become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed on the bench at the decision of captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although he was never the most accurate of players, not even at the peak of his career, at the age of 48 he does not fit into the tight-fitting Le Golf National course, where tall grass often punishes the wrong shots.
And in case that wasn’t enough, Mickelson faces off in Sunday’s ninth game against British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below the 12 individual games, start off well, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he could not say much more.
“He understood perfectly the role he played today, slapped me on the shoulder, shook my arm and told me that tomorrow he would be ready,” Furyk shared.
“He was completely confident in himself.
It has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought I’d play more, but in the end that’s how things are and that’s how we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangibles to the team.
“He’s a fun, sarcastic person, he’s smart and he likes to mess with people, he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he said.
“I like to see how good the younger players have been with him this week.
“He’s a lot more than a good player.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears for the disappearance of the advantage.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead in the last day of Ryder Cup individual can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Dane made his debut in 1997 in a game at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended up reaching the finish line with a minimal lead by winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You still think we had a big advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won by little,” Bjorn reflected in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go to all of them.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are on the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I will not get tired of saying it, I am focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I am also very aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted by the performance of his players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we meet another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of the individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It’s great to be with a partner next door when things are going well, but when you face things individually, then test your golfing skills to the fullest.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, that they get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for his players to perform better individually than with his teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those last day spins, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but finishing as a loser after the European miracle at Medinah.
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players for the final day.
“We have 12 important games, but you would want to have a quick start like Brookline’s or Medinah’s.
When you see the momentum going in one direction, there’s a lot of pressure in those intermediate games.
We prepared our lineup with this in mind and put the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
“I decided this order because I think it covers all the way,” Bjorn explained about his selection for the individuals.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The newest German Navy frigate should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it will not arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and the ever-increasing cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, was adjourned until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy younger frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "crucial software and hardware defects" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel required on the former Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship was dramatically overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the total price of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it already reaches the staggering amount of 3,100 million euros, compared to the initial 2,200 million.
The problems of the younger frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making waves.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships ready to deploy.
The officer claims that this problem is growing, as old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the Inverewe gardens at Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key locations around the property to keep track of bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
Then, a habitat map will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape-scale image of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating grasslands and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work affecting children and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do flies’ glue traps, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who periodically carry out surveys, inspections of children and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organisation even has Scotland's only and first reserve of bats at Threat Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, Estate Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
“Threave has a large area for bats,” he says.
"We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are a lot of things we don’t yet know about bats, so the work we’ve done here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
It stresses the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on the properties, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest could kill up to 400 females and offspring, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them, as well as destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
“There is still a lot to learn about bats, and for many of the species, we don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape lawsuits and his lawyers prepare to sue the German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the rape allegations against him false, claiming that the only thing people want is to make themselves known using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375,000 to say nothing about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after its publication, Ronaldo, 33, called this news fake in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
“No, not a thousand times.
What was said today is false," the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or said.
“People want to know me by my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it’s part of my job.
I’m a happy and respectable man,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they call "an inadmissible statement of suspicions in the privacy area," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in Nevada's Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, knelt down saying that he was 99% a gentleman, but that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that they both had consensual sexual relations.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was terrified of the retaliation and worried about the public scorn.
The 34-year-old says she is seeking to revoke the agreement while she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Carmakers will leave the UK
The UK would forever regret losing its position as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was worrying that Toyota UK had stated on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need to make a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that in the event of no Brexit deal, the impact of border delays could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which is responsible for the manufacture of Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will witness how production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in case a deal is not reached in Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is very tight, with parts from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars arriving every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and there could be delays and shortages of parts.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls."
"It is essential to have a deal. And we want it to be the best deal, to enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The expertise of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains.”
Toyota could not estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant's competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Burnaston's 24-year employee and Unite's trade union coordinator, said its members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they had presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed
The White House said the high-risk meeting between Donald Trump and Undersecretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed another week due to the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Russia’s aides and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence, he has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president through the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accuse him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is still no set date, it could be this week or it could be one more week late, given all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, but you know I like the press to be informed.”
Some journalists have questioned this claim, as Sanders has been running since September 10 without holding a press conference.
When Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders stated that the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to reporters' grandiloquence, although she added that she would not be the one to deny that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not cite any source who endorsed the data.
"If the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, that is much better than addressing the questions to her," Sanders said.
“You are witnesses of how we have been doing this for the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can talk directly to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, press conferences alone are scarce.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a free and sometimes strange appearance before the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Secretary of Health to calm the mood in the face of Brexit
The Health Secretariat has sent a letter to EU workers at Scotland’s NHS expressing the country’s gratitude and expressing its desire for them to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government is committed to covering the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment have continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal situation.
I know this is a worrying time for everyone.
This is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Partners in the European Union and beyond bring indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's (31-27) loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State coach, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
He apparently fainted when he reached the band line.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen in the band line before taking him on a stretcher for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in a red jersey, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five innings in total on Saturday before leaving the match, bringing his total of the season to 18.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they purchase property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters.
The tax increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on high-income people.
The postage tax increase will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will serve to support the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rent, may be up to 3%.
Finance expects the change to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-UK residents, which is driving up prices and making it harder for first-time homebuyers to gain access to the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson requested a tax cut on property transfer to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused large builders of keeping housing prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate tax revenue percentages on moderately priced homes to fix the "shame of the housing sector" that is living in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of housing-related reform proposals, including rent control and a ban on homelessness where the tenant is not to blame.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
This is why we need to fix the housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is just as easy for those people who do not live in the UK, as for companies based abroad, to buy housing as for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity of not having a roof remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "last ambition" was to become Scotland's coach at some point.
This 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northwest club, which currently occupies third place in the League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played in the B-team once, and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club.”
Ross's predecessors as coach of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic states that he felt no concern about succeeding those figures so consolidated in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Will success for me now depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly unique to a Premier League club,” he said.
“It’s not going to be an easy task to get to, but it’s likely that I’ll only consider that I’ve succeeded here if I can return the club to the Premier League.”
Ross has only spent three years as a coach after a stint as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint as a coach at Hearts.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St Mirren to move from being on the brink of descent to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to be more comfortable now than he has ever been during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I probably found myself at a real crossroads,” he recalled, about taking over Alloa.
“I really thought training was perfect for me, even more so than playing.
It sounds weird because it didn’t go wrong, I won reasonably well in life and enjoyed some successes.
Playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you need to overcome every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and pressure at work, but I like training.
I’ve always enjoyed training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced growth of 2.7 percent during July, but consumption in restaurants fell 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of CGA's trade advisory board in charge of compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's longer-than-expected stay in the World Cup resulted in a similar pattern in July, in which pubs enjoyed a 2.8 percent increase in consumption, although restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant turnover during June worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specializing in beverages were the ones that obtained the best results with increases in consumption higher than the reductions experienced by the restaurants.
Pubs specializing in food also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It’s like people just want to go out and drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, beverage consumption increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and meal consumption decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, an employee of RSM’s leisure and hospitality analytics company, said: “These results represent a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since the end of April.
Time and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent annually will be especially painful if added to that the continued increase in costs.
“The warm, long summer could not have come at a worse time for restoration businesses and time will be in charge of telling whether the temperature moderation experienced during August will provide much-needed respite for the sector.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with combined profits of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is considered the industry benchmark.

A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in the number of "Fake Insta" pages
This news has led to an increase in fear of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account to show to their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rise in the number of fake Instagram accounts (referring to the social photo-sharing network Instagram).
This news has led to an increase in fear of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they used a softened “main” account to show their parents while they had other private accounts.
A mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found a teenage girl asking to be “raped.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It is alarming that there are so many teens tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from his joining the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to being a spokesperson for the athletes and I look forward to contributing and helping to lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic gold medals and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from being able to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered an apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I currently do agility exercises.
Thanks for the messages of encouragement.”
An advertisement for a breast milk extractor comparing women to cows divides public opinion on social media
A breast milk extractor company has divided public opinion on the networks with an ad comparing nursing mothers with cows being milked.
To announce the launch of the world’s first “silent portable breast milk extractor,” Elvie released an ironic music video-style announcement to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new breast milk extractor.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ugly for cows to the rhythm of a song with lyrics like "Yes, it moved me, but I don't have a tail" and "If you don't notice, they're not udders, they're my breasts".
The chorus continues: “Mux, mux, I’m feeding babies, mux, mux, I’m muxing my friends.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that this manifests the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we robbed them of their children days after giving birth.”
The Elvie milk extractor can be placed discreetly inside a maternal bra (Elvie/mother)
Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why aren’t they used to advertise a milk extractor for the mothers who are left with their babies?”
Another viewer added the following: "What an announcement with so little tact."
Other viewers defended the ad, including a woman who said the song seemed "very funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
Getting my milk out made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit silly, but I interpret it as a joke.
“It’s a great product,” he wrote.
Another commented, “This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discrete extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can discreetly fit into a maternal bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie Extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallels between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it entails while demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This isn’t the first time Elvie has taken over the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign godparents to the children.
Traditionally, most godparents were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of people who are godparents or who are part of their household are in the country illegally, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
We will continue to pursue these individuals,” Albence said.
In order to prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court before a month has elapsed since their arrest instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear by videoconference rather than in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be promptly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to flee, according to shelter workers and system reports published over the past few months.
Lawyers have claimed that these fears increase in larger centers such as the one in Tornillo, where there is a greater chance that the symptoms of a child having a bad time will go unnoticed due to its size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could mean a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "of any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the right conditions for their return were in place and blamed "some Western countries" for the "spreading of irrational fears" that caused refugees not to return.
"We are turning to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that the military actions would target the jihadists, including the soldiers of the al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra front, which "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for ensuring the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the body's work should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would get re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting, impeachment and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
It would be the most dramatic end of a presidency.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million from four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the ratings of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the nights when major news broke.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, showrunner for ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about a ministerial cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
He said he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell said.
There is entertainment within the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, Washington’s plots can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Still, it’s more than just an informed citizen spending six hours watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of “anonymous” sources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin bomber jacket (“a garment full of arrogance,” the Washington Pos stated) and the implication of Mr. Pos’s descriptions of the pound.
I’m not going to watch Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it’s giving you something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, a senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” a space that deals with the character changes and daily twists and turns of the Trump show (the conflict with the NFL, the praises of Kim Jong-un...).
You can’t afford to miss an episode or you’ll be left behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but I was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back then and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss remarked.
“I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

The foreign money reaches moreas to finance the candidacies to the House for the elections of the half of the legislature
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is receiving a large inflow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives in running roles to occupy the same position.
This newly reorganized district outside of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who secured his place in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another serving representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapped over the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans had manipulated the constituency of the old districts in their favor.
The election race in the new 17th congressional district unleashed a campaign funding festival among the parties' main financial arms, the Democratic Campaign Committee of Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after achieving a narrow victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which enjoyed wide following.
That post was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered the possibility of penalizing The Savior for his support of China, and then backed down.
Diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners threw the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to order the return of heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement earlier this month.
However, only the possibility of imposing sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was discussed.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would prove very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed holding a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from emigrating to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions being applied to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, a symptom of the importance the administration attaches to it, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton’s White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations as long as the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Studying History
The next negative case could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the case of possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s justice, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public archive.
Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to be held accountable to that body, just when he has to prepare for the election, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
There are many unknowns and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, as is that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to carry out a coup against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy is accelerated or reversed.
Americans are facing several of these turning points at this time.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying water up his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for office.
Mr. Rosenstein has stated that the information in The Times is not true.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s just-requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or unbiased or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that demands responsibilities from Mr. Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was the head of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to hang Shabbat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”
Norman Eisen, an experienced partner at the Brookings Institution, is the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the game against Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive tie achieved in Spain against Villarreal that same month, would put them in a very favorable position to qualify in the Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until a 2-2 tie against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us as Villarreal are a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We entered the game believing we could achieve something positive and we reached a point.
We had the chance to win in the end, but overall, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
Next Thursday will be another big European night.
We hope to be able to achieve all three points, but it will be difficult, because they achieved a good result in their last match, but with the support of our public, I am sure that we will be able to fight to achieve a positive result.
“Last year was tough between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the team, but there is an excellent environment right now.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the trainings are good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the past season and succeed.”
Women care about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this study by Nationwide said they commented with their partners on the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance department.
You can start with the following.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes to them well in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family to agree on where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a determining factor when determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that the professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider signing a power of attorney to manage your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your older father or mother has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down this information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.
“Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors treating it?” asked Martin.

Who will take care of the dog?

Man shot several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a compressed-air rifle as he walked home after leaving at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, official sources said, killed at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to rise.
Due to communications cuts, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that lies along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regency, an administrative region less than one province, had a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Celebes Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Rim of high seismic activity, so it suffers from earthquakes regularly.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have taken place in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra, which occurred on 26 December, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, resulting in the deaths of 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation wrought by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of a domestic violence crime, preventing a complaint from being filed for domestic violence and for resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, they took her phone away.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bond, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, in which he pleaded "not guilty at all" when asked, the jail said.
Palin faces three Type A misdemeanors, which means he could enter prison for up to a year and be fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Type B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
His fiancée accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to the PTSD syndrome he suffers after serving in the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kills hundreds
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death toll is expected to increase over the days.
The earthquake occurred just off Central Celebes, in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated through social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are trying to impose the death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a sentence that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan’s West Side Highway, claiming the lives of the pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused them serious injuries "intentionally", according to the notification of the intention to apply for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with a charge of 22 crimes, including eight crimes of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “remarkable planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the “heinous, cruel and depraved” attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the indictment.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade, the Southern District of New York has not prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos he viewed on his phone according to the indictment.
He also requested to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys in charge of representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence conviction with no possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians had to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that she should take charge of negotiations with the EU.
Parliamentarian Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that Britain would have “already left” the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May’s challenge to reconcile her party’s divided ranks was made clear by joining the Tories in favour of staying in the EU to an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the commitments of her Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated at the rally of Solihull's Leave Means Leave movement that he wanted to put an end to the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been counted on to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in office, we would have been out of the EU right now,” he said.
The Wellingborough Member of Parliament added: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan.”
Demonstrating his opposition to the EU, he said: “We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Tories member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march, from which she told reporters: “All I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs May, he added: “Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians must be made “uncomfortable” if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Today, this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray the Brexit decision and here we are meeting today to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the army of people from this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners with the Tories Against Brexit message after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frictionless border, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren plans to seriously think or run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider her candidacy for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday during a town hall session in a town in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been the focus of speculation that puts it as Trump’s successor in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the council’s format since Trump took office.
An aide asked if he planned to introduce himself to the president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and that’s why we need a woman in the post of president.”
An arrest was made in connection with the shooting of Sims, the LSU player.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
“Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result of it,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2-meter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starters last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to achieve victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, starting from pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and let Hamilton run with traffic at the back of the group, something that would prove decisive.
The Mercedes pitted one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton pushed ahead after several wheel-to-wheel maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly free the interior at the risk of falling behind after a double defensive maneuver in the third corner.
Max Verstappen departed from the last row of the starting grid and climbed to seventh place at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks to keeping his tyres to get faster in the final and lead Kimi Raikkonen to fourth position.
He eventually pitted on lap 44 but was unable to advance any positions in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
Lack of proper body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for her insistence on not leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an event in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that people were "miserable, disgusting and lying."
“The only thing that could happen is the most beautiful thing that’s happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the outrage, when you see the people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying,” he said.
“When you see these posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t go.
I didn't go."
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do any leaks?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?: "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
“No,” he said, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t filter her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“I asked you to keep your privacy and I did what you asked me to do.”
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night act: “I tell you that body language was not the right thing to do.
He may not have filtered it, but he used the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and disgusting, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the loss suffered on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the lap match 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an early lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer re-established the Giants' lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third loss in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to come back to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three victories before the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the 3:35 minute thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after assisting David Rutherford.
In an initially hectic period, Sullivan re-entered the home team in match 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to score the draw goal in 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants were ahead on the scoreboard before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard tied the match again with a goal through power play in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured victory by their fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on an airplane can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller considered a hero after he died to make sure a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
The death toll is 800 and there are many missing after a major earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area and many people are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to abandon his post in the control tower of Palu's violently swinging Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained at his post to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take you to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It breaks our hearts to find out,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands and the country’s disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the rubble and not many of them could be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the minimarkets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could be worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia experienced earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating a flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims there is one missing after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew had left the sinking plane without incident.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they had not been able to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed by the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered with very little height.
“That’s an extremely positive thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to advance between the water reaching their waists to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and scared, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that some sailors who were working near the site on a dock improvement task also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to move people to the shore before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in recorded airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors were referred to trial Saturday in a repeat trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial, he described to the jury how he used cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett claimed to have received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was meeting Chambers the night of his death contradicting his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger newspaper reported.
When these data showed that his cell phone met Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford took the stage on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he declared that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The cell phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“It took her out of her life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be seen for verdict by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and struggle against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and make combative hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
A New York City childcare worker sues a couple after a “racist” message
A New York City childcare worker will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that wasn’t directed at her from her mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed her anguish when she discovered that babysitter Giselle Maurice was black when she introduced herself on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOO, OTHER BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that the carer who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipina according to the New York Post's announcement.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her work day and sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice will sue the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands compensation of $350 a day for the six months of in-house work for which she was initially hired even though there was no contract between.
“Look, I want to show you that these things are not done,” he told the Post on Friday, adding later, “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to accusations of racism by claiming that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent him a message that she did not intend to send him.
It's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would they leave their children in the hands of a person whom they offended, even if it was because of a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
"Come on!"
After comparing the lawsuit with an “extortion,” Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Did you go for someone like that?”
That’s not very ethical,” the investment banker added.
As the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bear as may be concluded in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself on the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It’s so much fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s enormous success.”
After claiming that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "sweet bittersweet" after his death last year.
De Paddington, described as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and not presumptuous," he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who got something: you’re proud even if you didn’t really do it.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was a creation of his own and a product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say that he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I got a call from Nad to tell me that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave him to keep his heart from beating were slowly being consumed and leaving his body.
He had died a while before and was now dying.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at that moment of mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without noticing the ordeal she was suffering.
“No one detected him,” he said.
My head was down and I was crying all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Postcards from distressed women to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been placing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” he said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said their smile lit up any room.”
However, he left his job before he died and was "in a very deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis commented: “I am still concerned that there will be a side effect.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
“Christmas Day came to a close (when the children opened their presents, they made no eye contact with them or anything).”
He claimed that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: "He tore the family apart.
He unstucked us.
But we have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (a limited time and scope investigation), it is possible that we could get some unity,” Mr. Flake commented on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be “erased” due to the paralysis of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Their reluctance is due to a question of deadlines.
Five weeks to go before the midterm elections (November 6). If, as expected, Republicans score poorly, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea has fallen under Kim's rule.
The number of North Korean defectors bound for South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 desertions in the past year, down from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people crossing across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South (which technically continue at war) have improved markedly over the past few months.
That same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed roughly to work to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S.-imposed sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't trust our national security, and in those circumstances, there is no chance of us disarming unilaterally first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit to go to the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not suited by his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman ever behaved in this way, I would call her hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and talking while describing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him a “grotesque and coordinated reputational assassination” organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she believed Kavanaugh's statement demonstrated that he could not access the Supreme Court because it demonstrated that he had prejudice against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh if he is confirmed in office and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“What I have to say is this: If you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then you’re not fit to be in not just the Supreme Court, but the court you’re in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the Patient Protection and Accessible Health Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be overturned.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and even then wait for us to say, 'Look how good it is!'"
Women need to exercise.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and you cannot expel it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that weird, do I?”
He went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she also cried when she got angry, but who developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, 'You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then, it continued.
It looked brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest memories in one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, in which I began to cry with a rage impossible to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from behind the neck, a distant superior who had always caused me a slight fear, and led me to the hollow of the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll comfort you if they come to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacies.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an out-of-wedding adventure on a ship named Monkey Business and retired from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he remarked among laughter 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snow Whites and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was advanced, he was delayed in raising funds, so he swore he would not enter the race for the presidency unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to the male candidates would only contribute $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not present a formal campaign, she was overcome by emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported her, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters rather than delegates, and of anger at existing sexism) that were left speechless.
“You’d think she’d suffered a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
"You would think that Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"Did you cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war for Beijing could turn out to be positive
The initial bombings of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the war is far from over, a distancing between the countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year recording key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of 200 billion dollars, recording half of the items that come to the United States from China.
Beijing countered each time in the same way, most recently by raising tariffs from five percent to ten percent on $60 billion in American goods.
China has promised to imitate US measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will change in the short term.
To get Washington to back down, it would be necessary to give in to its demands, but to bow publicly to the United States would be far more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favor China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually far more dangerous than previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security, a center of studies.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All necessary conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive U.S. defeat on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle offered during the tournament, threw the ball into the water in the 16th hole of par 3, losing his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shone in all his series, becoming one of only four players to score a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was implemented in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was beaten 5&4 by the European team's worst-ranked player Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a became the European player with the most wins of the tournament, with 25.5 points.
“I don’t cry often, but I can’t help it today.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the cup back.
What’s important is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said after the European victory.
He passed the testimonial to fellow countryman John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in Sunday’s singles game.
“It’s amazing how proud I am today to be able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that boy play,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winner of 14 majors, placed just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend not to leave the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf of a high caliber throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning for a moment they put the Europeans in trouble.
We fought.
I took off my hat from Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 players played well.
We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I want these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
It's to take off the hat.
They were superior.”
Red tide information: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the most recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, there is an overall reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, increasingly unequal outcropping conditions are being observed in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier Counties, which may mean that concentrations are decreasing.
The red tide extends approximately 210 km from the coast from the northern counties of Pinellas to the southern counties of Lee.
Concentrations of 16 km can be found off the coast of Hillsboroug County, but in fewer places compared to last week.
The red tide was also found in Pasco County.
There have been reports of mid-level concentrations on or off the coast of Pinellas County last week, background and elevated concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background and elevated concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, background and mid-level concentrations on Charlotte County, background and elevated concentrations on or off the coast.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties, it is reported that respiratory irritation continues to occur.
No such cases have been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
