Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of COVID-19 patients requiring care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been dubbed coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, about 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild condition, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 results in more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a severe form of the disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution of the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (UK) with, between 31 December 2019 and this date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Obtaining Cumulative Number and Cumulative Incidence of COVID-19 Cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities of different countries as well as WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare it with the experience of Italy.
In order to assess the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. with data from Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The evolution of the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases within the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February before seeing a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing within the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions as well as differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care facilities are currently available across the EU/EEA for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
There is, however, a need for systematic collection to complement the current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds per 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios for saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 cases associated with a 90% risk of exceeding capacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment for COVID-19.
Since cases were previously grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, data on cases and beds in intensive care should preferably be set at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS 2).
The experience of Italy and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring care, particularly intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not leave enough time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window during which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a spike in patients requiring intensive care in the days or weeks to come.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which led to thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and it affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this paper strives to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this growing research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions are still awaiting answers, we hope that this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, forever marked the Chinese, who were forced to remain cloistered for the duration of the Golden Week as well as for long other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; this is why it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and quickly spread to all of China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For the WHO, COVID-19 is the “public enemy number 1”, potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 studies have been published on COVID-19, particularly in the fields of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020 presenting the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this new and growing topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that occurred in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of prevention and prognosis of the disease, and address some outstanding but still urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds.
However, during this century we experienced two highly human-pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recent history.
As shown in Fig.1,1, outbreaks of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019, to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic had rapidly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered to be the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO called the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had already spread throughout China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study conducted on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were older than 50, very few were younger than 20, and only 14 were younger than 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 developed in homes, mainly in Hubei Province and the outskirts.
The mean duration between symptom onset and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, coinciding with the massive displacements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5> 60), and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing single-stranded RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the genera alpha and beta.
The Spike glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) and to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken from the origin site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b as well as a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domains or functional motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of complete human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in complex with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, which provides indications for coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for screening drugs to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from bats and were transmitted to humans via civets and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission is yet to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would involve homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, the pangolin - a long-snouted mammal feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by the 99% genetic homology between a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% between two genomes constitutes a difference of importance, so conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may very well have similar properties.
It appears that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays as well as a temperature of 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally devoid of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can refer only to the studies previously carried out on other coronaviruses, in particular on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host through molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), in particular C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
In different ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein may allow the virus to evade immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, and in particular CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly remove infected cells.
The helper T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support the defense cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a restored patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion in the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs as well as other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multivisceral failure, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by outbreaks, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was an average of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2), based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the actual duration of the quarantine according to the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, vomiting and nausea.
Some patients experienced dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnea and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported from two recent studies in a family and a outbreak following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with higher MERS lethality compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
For SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%), and ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, out of 66,576 confirmed cases globally.
Comparatively, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2-4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality, and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to propagate than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak than it has been for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or were in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals can be carriers of the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that recovered patients can be carriers of the virus again, underscoring the need to increase quarantine time.
Patients have normal or reduced peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts of &lt; 4 <0xC3><0x97> 109/L and lymphocyte counts of &lt; 1 <0xC3><0x97> 109/L, as well as high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were identified in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a degradation product of fibrin present in the blood, was elevated, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral uneven shadows or opacity in frosted glass in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely compromise gas exchanges.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in the level of surfactant and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most disturbing chest exams often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocyte desquamation, the formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and ARS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which then no longer relied solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the SHERLOCK technique based on the CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which allows to identify synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA required between 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L and 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per l of sample) without a microlite.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality, if its use in clinical specimens proves conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only offer supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine as well as psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been proposed for treatment.
All pharmaceutical companies are working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nonetheless, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat to patients, and the leading cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-throughput oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation as well as invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECOM), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune response has been shown to result in cytokine shock in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, in particular TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3> and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, were used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shocks include modulation of the immune response by T cells, blockade of the cytokines IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1 and TNF, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 signaling suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, taking high-dose steroids had no beneficial effects on severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, careful use of short-cycle low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with a severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead has sent the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and production of antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have been cured of a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancient practice.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had cured from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in association with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are required in order to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
Moreover, given the therapeutic effects, certain drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes encoding the relevant antibodies or to look for antibodies effective against the main proteins of the virus.
This would rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components into a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain little or no known at all as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a severe form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proven effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 were seen in provinces in China that used TCM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7%), Ningxia Region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which has only used TCM for 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest cure rates.
However, this is a rather rough comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be taken into account in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing a treatment using Western Medicine (OM) only and a combination treatment combining OM and TCM.
It was found that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappearance of symptoms and the duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressively, the rate of symptom aggravation (mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nonetheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM remains to be determined through controlled trials conducted on a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel a strong concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a sense of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of the infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion, and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact searches and quarantine, as part of the public health services response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt among patients about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, individuals identified as probable cases, people in contact with these populations, as well as any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce potent long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Attenuated live vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and in models subject to lethal provocation as well as their protection against zoonotic virus infection remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is likely due to the fact that SARS went extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential goal in controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the significant delay (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations in coronaviruses.
As an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognostic model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies to date, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients are the following (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor in SARS prognosis, and this also appears to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals between the ages of 30 and 65, with 47.7% over the age of 50, according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been advanced as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and healing.
Correlation between CRP and severity as well as the prognosis for COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in case of tissue damage.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Thoracic X-ray results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in supplemental treatment for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose corticosteroids have been widely used for severe cases of SARS, many survivors have experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, steroid administration to COVID-19 patients should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of exceptional stress cases, with patients often experiencing long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty as well as the deaths of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the early stage of infection, such as coronaviruses that cause common colds.
As a result, newly infected or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost all the population with a view to halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the phase of decline will last 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not go extinct in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in samples from the middle nasal horn and throat of recovered patients 2 weeks after they were discharged from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like influenza.
However, encouraging signs were seen in China with the gradual decline in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to initial forecasts, the Ebola virus was expected to lead to up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, thanks to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectiousness and eventually goes extinct or evolves into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing, and also possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in feces, revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, precautionary measures should be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even anyone who may be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the wearing of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 (1860) respiratory masks helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent potentially infected droplets from being sprayed or deposited on surfaces, where they could be passed on to other people.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions capable of fully penetrating; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV in size, since both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to pass through five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, it is imperative that healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals should wear tight-fitting isolation gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have penetrated his body through the eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent visors or protective glasses in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash your hands with disinfecting soap more often than usual, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one meter with the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have put China on high alert after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population that the new virus was low-contagious, had limited human-to-human transmissibility and would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a noticeable easing, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn from this and take the necessary action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as each word counts and can affect the behavior and decisions of the population; (2) show more sensitivity and responsiveness to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from physicians or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic in its infancy, but also to try to keep it more responsive.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it has spread to all of China as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic is born as an impression of déj<0xC3><0xA0> vu.
However, there are notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the severity and mortality rate are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by severely ill patients, making it much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be positive for the virus again.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain unresolved, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-derived SARS coronaviruses, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from chiropractors.
What is the intermediate species that has allowed the transmission of the virus from the original host, for example bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a quick and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or resurface regularly like the flu?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to get answers to all these and many other questions.
However, no matter how much this costs, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
Only a few immunocompromised patients experienced severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS was in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
In addition to the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could generate approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, with the peak of the viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headaches, fever, malaise, and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough, and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, falsified liver function tests, and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory tests for suspected SARS.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokine shock, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of this same virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present all over the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year-old man hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and sustain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known to humans.
Diarrhoea is also seen in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms ranges from SARS-CoV to the four community HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and long-lasting spread after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCoVs causing moderate symptoms adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to occur, HCoVs must replicate in humans in a proportion sufficient to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
With this in mind, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the greater the number of people infected, the more likely it is that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by a quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is not sustainable.
They must maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolving hosts, natural hosts, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbors a close ascendant sharing a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often adapted well and is non-pathogenic to its host.
In the same way, a reservoir host houses the HCoV continuously and over the long term.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, since 80% of the animals on the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals can also serve as amplifying intermediate hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
This is why bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East showed that camels were seropositive for specific MERS-CoV-neutralising antibodies, as were camels from the Middle East found in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only via the respiratory tract, but also via the fecal route, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that separating the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoV from the pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided over the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have been derived from bat CoV, while parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of bats close to HCoV-229E have been found.
First, unlike alpacas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Then, bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV from alpaca has not been found in wild animals.
In reality, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while bat alpha-CoVs serve as a genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels could serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission of bats to camels and camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known from its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in camels for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels that have gone from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats via carving or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2-linked virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by cutting and eating game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species having been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoV could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
Nevertheless, the mutation rates of CoVs are about one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to camels.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently change patterns during RNA replication through a unique "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for CoVs observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
Beyond these three viral factors indicated above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
Recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, a study by electron cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times greater than that observed between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, camels and rodents, could constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to the box
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in adapting to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but encoded divergent ORF8 proteins.
This suppression splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is perceived as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which occurred in camels in Saudi Arabia.
While ORF4 could be observed in the bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaca exhibits a simple insertion of nucleotide, causing a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to VOCs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RODs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease "re-reading", which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic new viral strains when introduced into a bat.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In asymptomatic carriers, however, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociation of the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the camel market for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done on wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the VOCs of bats, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of the consumption of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In reality, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animal to human and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
First, if bats transmit a parent SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Whether a bat, pangolin, or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or the quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals, which can be harmful or cause disease.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and the reduction of the infant mortality rate during home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the leading cause of mortality among children under the age of five, with nearly 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor damaging effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common in health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily toothbrushing with a fluoridated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter from the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in the wild.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the effective surfactant and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have found that the use of lukewarm water does not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide strengthens the antimicrobial activity.Hand disinfectants containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against viruses of the norovirus (or Norwalk) type, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to thoroughly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid removal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or moisturizing agents of the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from the hands, but only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the latter remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have shown long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is attenuated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it risks increasing the spread of disease instead of curbing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Foam a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a pool of stagnant water can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or outdoors.
Wet and wet hands recur more easily.The areas most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and scaled nail polish can host microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economical alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or other soap options are not available. For example, pouring water from a suspended and drilled can or gourd and/or using ash if needed, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas), there is
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging jug using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap loaf.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is debated.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilet.
After hand-washing and hand-drying with hot air, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the pulp of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Air jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
The goal of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and prevent their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, it should be avoided that water on the forearms flows to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after caring for a sick person.
With regard to the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of handwashing were achieved during the first 20% of the wash, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing the frequency of handwashing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most of rural Africa, it is rare to find hand-washing taps near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be attributable to tenacious habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are conducted to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to foster changing behaviours.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmas.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating “good hand washing techniques” were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing hands” refers to a person’s refusal to take responsibility or to be an accomplice in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory “purification” measures, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.

It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to involuntary changes in the genomes of viruses, which are most likely due to the pressures exerted during selection, in particular by the host's immune system.
Examples include the loss of complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 could be observed in the bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaca exhibits a simple insertion of nucleotide, causing a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to VOCs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RODs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease "re-reading", which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic new viral strains when introduced into a bat.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.

This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In asymptomatic carriers, however, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociation of the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is defective in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 emerged following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals on the market have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by humans, either voluntarily or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoV in bats and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in HCoV transmission to humans.
Numerous factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from the bat and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Because the SARS-CoV infection is caused by human-to-market contact, the closure of fresh produce markets and the culling of fresh-to-market civets could have effectively ended the SARS outbreak.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be withdrawn from fresh produce markets to prevent the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many pangolin beta-CoV lines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the camel market for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done on wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the VOCs of bats, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There is no shortage of opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or deadly CoVs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of the consumption of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In reality, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Although bats have many characteristics conducive to the spread of viruses, the likelihood for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are made aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animal to human and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
All the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parent SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, especially domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether a bat, pangolin, or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or the quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have significant implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the criteria for the diagnosis of “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 is necessary
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this guideline described our experience and provided references to fight this pandemic globally.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge is gradually progressing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment regarding our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a “suspect case” and a “confirmed case” according to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that is now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To be able to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has garnered a lot of attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge is slowly progressing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were published in a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, with some contexts substantially changed.
Our guideline having received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We applaud their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), the confirmation of a suspected case must associate one of the characteristic elements of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of last few days as a hospital with symptoms or residence in the city of Wuhan, or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids);
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging showing the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts at the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspect case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome showing strong homogeneity with known novel positive coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for IgM and IgV antibody to SARS-CoV modification.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or in blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic testing of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth edition (February 8, 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes build on the researchers' ongoing work to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as airway samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive antibody-specific result to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution when it comes to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphical representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases”, we suggest that they follow and comply with the latest guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely manner to offer assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new COVID-19-related deaths, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19-related deaths in a single day.
The country records a record number of deaths due to the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected people recorded included 114 active cases and 33 cured people, who remained confined to their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on March 26 and was due to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always permitted.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
All over the world, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's confinement until May 1.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially life-threatening an HCoV infection can be.
Most HCoVs come from bats in which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also make it possible to better understand CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The genus Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play a genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoV) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of crossing the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier host(s), with important implications in the prevention of future contagions.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are present all over the world and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in temperate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce limit amounts of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on buying toilet paper to two and one pack per purchase at all stores nationwide, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit.
These limits were posted in the form of messages at checkouts and on the channels’ Facebook pages.
Buyers were apparently amassing reservations for fear of COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted purchases of toilet paper for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous four-package per-purchase restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, said that with the four-package restriction in place, “many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery,” and called the request “unprecedented,” while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it “unexpected.”
Sales saw a “sharp increase” last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the quantity allowed to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made stock available earlier for a promotion scheduled on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make the task difficult.
It predicts higher production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are not able to honor Wednesday’s promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a distribution sector expert at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in small stocks that, once exhausted, leave large empty spaces in shelves, reinforcing the impression of scarcity.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the shelves are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, that will likely reduce panic,” Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who makes Sorbent paper, stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate website, said some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were organized because buyers were on leave during the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday’s edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut out and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia in which they announced they were not planning to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization Calls COVID-19 a Pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the current outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) a pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, and not to the dangerousness of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to urge governments to take action:
“All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries screen, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“We are deeply concerned, not only by the alarming levels of spread and severity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said, in remarks published by CNN in February, that “other than the flu, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its onset until its continued spread on a global scale.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that “we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”
He added: “We have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “In short, the situation will get worse.”
On Thursday, the Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an outbreak of coronavirus disease in progress since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The lethality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by putting in place travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic disruptions, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages compounded by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the global student population.
False information about the virus has been circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, as well as other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a outbreak of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is thought to be zoonotic in origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely linked to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person with symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and this person had no obvious link to the later market outbreak.
Of the first outbreak cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could date back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases appeared to be decreasing in China but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK population needed to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those that showed only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, until January 23, an estimated 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections were detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection in 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are cured.
For those who do not heal, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80 percent of deaths occurred in people over the age of 60, and 75 percent suffered from pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official COVID-19 pandemic-related death counts generally refer to people who died who were tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include untested deceased persons - e.g., at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the numbers of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death count.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged “We know that [the number of deaths reported] is underestimated,” a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the underevaluation in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic of 2009.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia took place in France on February 14.
On February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and especially health.The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the global case-to-death ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the case-death ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms that occurred between January 1 and 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that appeared after February 1, 2020). The other indicators are the rate of lethality (lethality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who succumb to a disease, and the rate of non-infection (infection).
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have attempted to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the tests on mortality rate estimates.
The WHO argues that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: “Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease becomes lacking in available hosts.
But it’s almost impossible to make any relevant predictions right now about when this will happen.”
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said “this could be over by June” if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two.”
According to a study by Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed “until a vaccine is available (in possibly 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus—because it spreads very easily—will disappear completely” and that it “could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year.”
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucus), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.The WHO states that about one in six people is seriously ill and has breathing difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and bluish face or lips; seven immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. Subsequent course of the disease can lead to severe, severe, and severe pneumonia syndrome.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results confirming the infection, so the researchers have issued recommendations that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; more often it is five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing unprotected can throw droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fine droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected by speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected during exhalation, including speaking, although the virus is usually not airborne.
Postillons can land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and thus cause airborne spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it can be transmitted through the stool, this risk is considered low.
The government of China has ruled out the possibility of feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in advanced stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few laboratory-confirmed reports of asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others. The virus survives for hours or even days on surfaces.
Precisely, the virus could be detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.Domestic and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however British authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, such as after being in contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease outbreak.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in naturally related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the initial SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two bat strains.
It is 96% identical to the whole genome of another sample of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in some parts of genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and those from humans.
Comparing the entire genome to date has revealed a maximum of 92% common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms, however the final confirmation is by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the infected secretions or scanner.
A study comparing PCR and scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, albeit less accurate, as many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that “the scanner should not be used for screening or as a first-intention test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a nasopharynx sample but a throat sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Typical imaging elements on X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral frosted glass opacities and absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to cross-linking with other infections such as adenovirus, non-confirmed PCR imaging is of limited accuracy for detecting COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of chest scanners to PCR and showed that while the imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, recommending that it be taken into account as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect features of the virus in imaging on both x-rays and scanners.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include having overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
It was recommended that those who had already been infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission, and many governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential travel to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spreading to communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been infected. Health care professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and wear protective glasses. Searching for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection.
Governments’ use of mobile phone location data in this regard has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits to this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications were launched or offered on a voluntary basis, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are currently circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing your nose and gargling with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been to the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after biting, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a volume of at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easily accessible.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (within one minute of disinfectant exposure for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% iodine povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or nursery, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or a handkerchief when they cough or sneeze, and to throw away any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by the projected postillons by talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Wearing a mask can reduce people’s propensity to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene.”
The WHO has recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they care for a patient with COVID-19, even though it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people not touch their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical fabric masks, and China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially when they are close (1 meter (3 feet) or less) to other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make face masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outings without a mask or other means of covering his nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone protects themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered anyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the wearing of the mask on passengers on long-distance trains and buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any outing, while recommending the manufacture of a handmade mask to those who can not buy it.
The masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by decreasing contact between people.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions, and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.
One can apply methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting one’s travels, avoiding crowds, greeting one another without contact and keeping a physical distance from others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum size of rallies recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the social social gatherings of more than two people. The older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system have an increased risk of serious illness and complications. They have thus been invited by the CDC to stay at home as far as possible from the affected areas.
The use of the term "social distancing" suggested the need for total social isolation, rather than encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means; some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with a person you live with who does not have the virus or who does not have symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who believe they are infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for proper segregation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
Individuals who have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where transmission is very high were asked to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
The control strategies of an epidemic are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
The containment is implemented during the early stages of the epidemic and aims to track and isolate infected people, as well as to introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are turning to the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow this spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproduction to less than 1. Part of managing an epidemic of infectious disease is trying to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the entire epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public measures of social distancing such as closing schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage acceptance of such interventions and participation in them; as well as environmental actions such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected people who have quarantined themselves, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are overwhelmed.
Suppression may be preferred, but should be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), because otherwise transmission bounces back rapidly when the measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eradicate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing treatments.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications or drinking beverages as well as rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO said some “traditional and artisanal remedies” can soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to redeploy resources at various levels, including devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-urgent interventions where possible, separating and isolating patients' and patients' intensities by re-entry and COVID-19-positive testing.
There are various theories regarding the place of origin of the very first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are usually linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. A outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Province Hospital, who informed the CDC.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then published a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January, with the number of cases doubling about every seven and a half days in the early stages of the epidemic.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub as well as a major rail connection.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 healed.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted travel and put in place border controls.
National responses included containment measures such as quarantine (also called home, shelter or containment orders) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are subject to some form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 59 million in South Africa.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world experienced some form of containment, a figure that rose to 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world’s population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case would date back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a outbreak of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 26, which she informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no “manifest evidence” of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping as a “people’s war” to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a cordon sanitaire was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, in order to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government instituted new measures to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending Spring Day holidays.
The country’s universities and schools were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been instituted in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and China’s museums have been temporarily closed.
Population movement control has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (more than half of the population) have experienced some form of travel restriction. After the epidemic entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being “imported” from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city.On March 23, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted inside the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveler returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases transmitted inside the country has been essentially blocked, and that the epidemic has been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the containment began. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28, without specifying when this policy would end.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The State Affairs Council announced a day of mourning to begin with three minutes of silence on April 4 at 10 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming holiday, although the central government has asked families to pay tribute online to respect the physical distancing of COVI and avoid a renewal of COVI.
It has been confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
The nation’s health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on Feb. 20, largely attributed to a rally in Daegu of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji worshippers visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected of causing the outbreak.

The screening methods included mandatory individual symptom reporting by international newcomers via a mobile app, virus screening drives delivering results the next day, and increased testing capacity to allow testing of nearly 20,000 people each day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the epidemic, although it did not quarantine entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for mishandling the epidemic by the government or on the contrary praising his reaction.

A CNN report said the combination of Italy’s large elderly population and the inability to test all people with the virus to date may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the most flexible among affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the UK government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its manifest lack of responsiveness and vivacity in response to public concerns.On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, discouraging all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work from home if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.

Despite this, the United States took time to start testing, which obscured the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were marred by defective testing kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval for non-governmental testing kits (universities, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for eligibility for a test until early March (mandatory doctor's prescription thereafter).
On February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.

Ma also donated medical equipment to Canada, with the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressing concerns about masks and screening kits made in China.
For example, Spain removed 58,000 coronavirus screening kits made in China with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese protective masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks; they were thought to have come from China, but they actually came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in the regions of Latin America and Africa, and on 2 April the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004, where Chinese authorities had been accused of cover-up that had hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government “provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year.”
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply an international ban on travel to Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that although it was "certainly not a recommendation of the WHO", it was nevertheless a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and he spoke of a "previous
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the USPPI was due to “the risk of global spread, particularly for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said: “There is no reason for measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel.”
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries that “do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it was about to appear.”
Tedros then declared that we are “as strong as our weakest link” and urged the international community to “invest today or pay more tomorrow.” On 11 February, the WHO established in a press conference that the disease was called COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to integrate “the strength of the entire UN system into the response.”
A UN crisis management team has therefore been activated, coordinating the entire UN response, which the WHO says will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to bring their expertise to manage the broader social, economic and developmental implications of the epidemic.”
On February 14, a WHO-led joint mission team was nevertheless activated in China in order to "should be able to send international and WHO experts to China in order to support national management and assess the "gravity and transmission of the disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and conducting field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the level of the provinces and com
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team on site to assess the situation.On 28 February, WHO representatives said that the global coronavirus threat assessment had gone from “high” to “very high”, its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergency Management Program, said: “This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you need to be prepared,” adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan then said that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that “we absolutely accept that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus.”
On 11 March, the WHO said the coronavirus outbreak could be described as a pandemic.
The Director-General noted that WHO is “extremely concerned both by alarming levels of spread and severity and by alarming levels of inaction.” WHO has faced significant criticism of its inadequate management of the pandemic, particularly due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people by 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts focused on respecting the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone was entitled to relief interventions and that this responsibility rested with the government.
The group insisted that lack of resources or health insurance should never serve as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
Experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are responsible for the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in different countries of the world, as well as views and advice.
Between policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy and responses to the effects of containment and travel restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge posed by the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British cabinet minister Michael Gove and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for its management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been relieved of their posts following their management of the quarantine in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of politicians to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the initial idea that the coronavirus epidemic started in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump called the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus,” declaring that in China “censorship has overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which has subsequently been branded as racism by some opponents and intended to “divert attention from its administration’s inability to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained a U.S. government telegram outlining the outlines of a communications ploy apparently from the National Security Council, the strategy of which is as follows: “Everything comes from China.
We are being asked to try to communicate this message in every possible way, including at press conferences and television appearances.” News outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda push to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and 'policy of generosity'".
Borrell also said that “China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while a priori sending aid to these last two countries.
The 100,000 masks donated by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own countries.
And other mask-related conflicts have also been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticised the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which has been hit by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said: "Only China has responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous “high-ranking political source” who indicated that 80 percent of Russian aid was “little if any useful for Italy”.
The source accused Russia of embarking on a “geopolitical and diplomatic” charm offensive.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio have denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane loaded with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering his assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to repay them if necessary.”
The scope of NATO’s “Defender 2020” military exercise planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO’s biggest maneuver since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public health crisis, it puts at risk not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries, but also those of the people of the countries in which they operate.” The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about twenty current members of parliament or other former politicians, as well as
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, stating that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to U.S. high sanctions on Iran. The epidemic has prompted calls for the U.S. to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care care program, and a health care system.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan’s “ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts” after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided over the response to President Moon Jae-in’s crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for mishandling the epidemic by the government or, on the contrary, for praising his response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could allow governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n to rule by decree until further notice, suspend parliament and elections and punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed on several cases of supply disruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and a disruption of plant operations and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have resulted in the disappearance of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, shelves, resulting in shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has warned of delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand has led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and has also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide and WHO warns that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity for daigous to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe as well as in North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural production, Northern Italy has not seen a significant decline, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
The food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, as members of the Chinese government unblocked pork stockpiles to ensure sufficient subsistence for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy for food producers to stockpile reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy were felt in China: according to a March 16 media report, the Chinese economy was hit very hard in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral epidemic has been identified as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain unstable until a clearer picture emerges of potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could outweigh that of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
The estimate by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis reported an impact of more than $300 billion on the global supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is said to have "shuffled" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand in China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 following a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concern over the coronavirus epidemic, several U.S. stock indexes including the NASDAQ-100, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their sharpest drop since 2008, with a Dow Jones dropping to 1,191 points, the largest drop in a day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the rating of China’s sovereign debt, but retained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again due to fears related to the coronavirus, with the largest decline being seen on March 16.
Many believe that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures put in place by central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did during the 2008 financial meltdown.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected due to travel bans, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise industry has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year’s festivities, and private companies have also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the Lunar New Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities have extended New Year’s holidays until February 10, requiring most workplaces not to reopen before that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of infectious disease response and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year's celebrations. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store opening hours or temporary closures.
Visits to merchants in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders saw a decline of 50 to 60 percent.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic in shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing cleaning frequencies, installing thermal scanners to control customer temperature, and cancelling events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in a state of extreme poverty in Latin America.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, many of the roughly 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves stranded at home in inland provinces or stuck in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for help from the government.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The containment in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) unemployed. The Angus Reid Institute survey has observed that 44% of Canadian workers have experienced a certain type of unemployment.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies switched their employees to a government-subsidized partial-activity scheme called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both salaried and independent, at the global level.
Arts and culture organizations have attempted to maintain their (often state-funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists wherever possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions were closed until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place in the last week of the Christian penance period of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live or television while others offer to practice their worship in “drive-in”.
Like the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome which closed its churches and chapels and St. Peter’s Square which emptied itself of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies have also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and Gurdwaras.
Iran's health minister announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and the holy sites were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the biggest disruption to the world sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events have either been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 English Football Championship, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be “rescheduled beyond 2020, but no later than summer 2021.” Casinos and other gaming establishments around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The entertainment world has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as those on Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet as a replacement for traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online “festivals” created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their work.
Online, many Internet memes on the topic of coronavirus have spread because many favor humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a resurgence of prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (while the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist sentiments expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or received justifiable punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been given to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of the areas affected by the virus.
Following the progression of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, Italians, inhabitants of the first country in Europe to suffer a serious COVID-19 epidemic, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have initially signed petitions aimed at banning the Chinese from entering the country.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan made fury on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus,” a term his critics regard as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and studying in major Indian cities are reportedly harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The chairman of the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that’s why God took revenge on them.”
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which calls them “false”. In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were fueled by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as “foreign waste” that should be “eliminated”.
Many paid access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles related to the epidemic freely available.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or asymptomatic people.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngeal swab or the sputum sample.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test from pharyngeal swabs is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus can disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep respiratory tract by a suction catheter, or sputum (sputum) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test as of January 23, 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the real gene "E" shared by all the new CDCR-Coronaviruses' CDCs, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR.
Among the older versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests obtained inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck in the tests at the CDC in Atlanta. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only then that federal and local laboratories were authorized to begin screening.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories began screening in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability nationwide of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. Sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service.On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID-19 infection detection test.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, thus allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization (U.S.A.) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S.A. from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the U.S., and Abbott plans to ramp up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, in the hopes that it can provide results in a quick 15 to 20-minute test, such as a flu test.
A March 2020 bibliographic study concluded that "pulmonary X-rays have a low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT [tomodensitometry] may be conclusive even before the onset of symptoms."
Typical symptoms visible on MDD include multi-lobed bilateral frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, “crazy paving” and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, albeit less accurate, with many of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “DMT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”In March 2020, CDC recommends PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population monitoring.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
The high-speed automated systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, a single peripheral blood sample is usually used, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by cutaneous puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction step is required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that duly informed the agency and therefore can now distribute their antibody testing.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after infection begins.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were sufficiently effective to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place an appropriate plan under which suspected cases can stay at home, "emergency use cases will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients spit inside, return it and later receive the result of the test.The British NHS has announced that it is conducting a pilot project aimed at testing suspected cases at home, eliminating the risk that a patient's CO-drive into it.
In Germany, the National Association of Physicians of Compulsory Health Insurance said on March 2 that it had the capacity to perform some 12,000 tests per day in an outpatient setting, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study found that in the French calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 5 000 samples were tested in the "Human" and "Human" samples were tested in the "Human" group, and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from the Technion and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modelling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capability.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed free models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without liquid handling robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, UK and US.
This situation has prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further screening.On March 31, it was announced that the UAE was now the country testing the majority of its population per capita for the coronavirus, and was in the process of detecting it.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-scale high-speed laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their “Huo-Yan” emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside of China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was only published on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to respond to the demand.
On the other hand, experts say that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programs as the best way to slow the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for tests due to the wide spread of the virus has caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the reserves of swabs and chemical reagents have been depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the reliability of its test kits.
In the U.S., CDC-developed test kits had “flaws,” and the government removed bureaucratic barriers to private testing. Spain purchased test kits from China’s Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results unreliable.
The company explained that the erroneous results could be related to the inability to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it will remove the kits that gave erroneous results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic provided false results.Slovakia purchased from China 1.2 million test kits that proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a “high error rate” and that it did not “use them”. The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The screening, followed by the quarantine of those who obtained a positive result and the tracing of people who had been in contact with the carriers of SARS-CoV-2, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first COVID-19-related death in Italy, conducted two sets of tests on the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Nearly half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all of the cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Through aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed far less rapidly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on the planned date at the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive confinement, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower rates of lethality, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have limited COVID-19 experience send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only those admitted to the hospital will have a positive test value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of washing your hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing your hands systematically with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the oro-fecal route.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby’s buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you do not have water or soap on hand, you can wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after caring for a sick person;
after changing diapers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after biting or coughing/sneezing;
after touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste;
Hand hygiene in medical settings refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medication or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals, which can be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and the reduction of the infant mortality rate during home births.
According to a 2013 study, improved hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate related to these diseases by almost 50%.
Actions to promote hand washing could reduce diarrhea episodes by about one-third, a figure comparable to that achieved by providing drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing your hands with soap can reduce diarrhea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). It is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the leading cause of mortality among children under the age of five, with nearly 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing your hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhea deaths by almost half and acute respiratory infections deaths by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually associated with other sanitary measures as part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor damaging effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common in health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the oral-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (mimicking, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or theft.
Hands should also be washed properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, especially before and after treating a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or biting, after touching animal waste or handling animals, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand soap cleaning is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 in 54 countries and focusing on the hygiene of hands, 38.7% of households on average used to wash their hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the rate was the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China showed the lowest rate (23%).
For example, the Philippine Ministry of Education has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily toothbrushing with a fluoridated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, it is necessary to add soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter from the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
An adequate water flow, however, makes cleaning easier.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still states that “automatic liquid soap dispensers are preferable.”
Antibacterial soaps have been highly recommended for people who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in the wild.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the effective surfactant and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have found that the use of lukewarm water does not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-aqueous hand hygiene products based on alcohol (commonly called hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide strengthens the antimicrobial activity.Hand disinfectants containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a 35 decibel reduction) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against viruses of the norovirus (or Norwalk) type, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to thoroughly wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands as well as the gaps between the fingers and nails should be confronted for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
It is also worth cleaning your fingertips by rubbing them, palm to palm.The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when your hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid removal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or moisturizing agents of the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from the hands, but only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the latter remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have shown long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is attenuated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, there are many who do not have the means to buy soap, and instead use ash or soil.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it risks increasing the spread of disease instead of curbing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you wash your hands properly to prevent disease transmission by following the steps below:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Foam a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a pool of stagnant water can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or outdoors.
Wet and wet hands recur more easily.The areas most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and scaled nail polish can host microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economical alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or other soap options are not available. For example, pouring water from a suspended and drilled can or gourd and/or using ash if needed, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas), there is
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging jug using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap loaf.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is debated.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilet.
In 2008, a paper towel industry-funded study, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After hand-washing and hand-drying with hot air, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the pulp of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Air jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the pulp of the fingers and up to 77% on the palms.The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the device at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and the device and possibly contaminating other users of the toilet as well as the environment of the toilet within a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer makes it possible to diffuse microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in a medical setting became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use led to a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a bristle brush to remove them.
As germs in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse and wipe thoroughly with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
This makes it possible to avoid re-contamination of the hands in contact with the surfaces.
The goal of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that insufficient hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, washing your hands properly and following other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and rubbing hands in the health field.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website for comments from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines “Five Indications” for Hand Hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
after having contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap ("medicinal" or "antimicrobial" soaps) gives the handwashing agent a germ-destroying action.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing a surgical operation or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To "" rub"" the hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a wash product based on chlorine.
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
There is no need to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, it should be avoided that water on the forearms flows to the hands.
Once the hands have been washed, it is advisable to dry the hands using a sterile cloth and put on a surgical coat.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after caring for a sick person.
With regard to the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of handwashing were achieved during the first 20% of the wash, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing the frequency of handwashing beyond 35%.
If one compares the hand washing performed with an ordinary soap to that performed with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, when comparing the cleaning of the hands with an alcohol-based solution and the washing of the hands with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, it is found that the first reduces the contamination to 2 percent.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing influenza A (H1N1) virus and Clostridium difficile spores present on the hands. In order to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, it is possible, in particular, to train staff in hand washing, to put more alcohol-based products at the disposal of this person and address.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered to be an inexpensive and essential tool for preserving health and even eating properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or handwashing facilities at home, at school and in the workplace, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most of rural Africa, it is rare to find hand-washing taps near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be attributable to tenacious habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing and awareness-raising activities can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural change in the population.
Monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary for this approach to be successful.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to promoting handwashing in schools, we can cite the example of UNICEF's "Three Star Approach", which encourages schools to take simple, low-cost handwashing measures to ensure that their hands are clean.
Once the minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are conducted to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to foster changing behaviours.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of healthy years of life gained (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for vulnerable people such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "Modern Nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The onset of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating “good hand washing techniques” were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing hands” refers to a person’s refusal to take responsibility or to be an accomplice in something.
It stems from a Bible verse of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth undertakes to wash her hands in a compulsive manner in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, a symbol of her bad conscience in the face of the crimes she committed and which she incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering or considering unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and value handwashing devices more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory “purification” measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for purposes of both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Handwashing, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of the handwashing rituals promoted in many religions, including Baha'iism and Hinduism.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
Controls of COVID-19 risks in the workplace
COVID-19 risk controls in the workplace designate the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary by workplace and task, based on an assessment of the risks of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other collaborators. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, and a respiratory label as well.
Jobs at medium exposure risk include those requiring frequent or close contact with people without suspected or known COVID-19 but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public in particular in schools, high-density work environments and certain high-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in case of encounter with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to people with suspected or known COVID-19 to be at a very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or take or manipulate samples from people with suspected or known COVID-19.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to take care of others, or fear possible exposure.
Business models can change, both in terms of the goods requested and the means of acquiring them (including shopping outside rush hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be discontinued and an infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, family and community context risk factors, and individual worker risk factors such as advanced age or chronic conditions.
They also outline the controls needed to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
Epidemic response objectives include reducing transmission among staff, protecting those at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms a framework generally used in occupational health and safety in order to group risk controls by effectiveness.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical checks involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on workers' behaviour. They can be the most economical solution to implement.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action on the part of the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the worker's risk, appropriately adapted as required (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory labeling, including covering their mouth and nose to cough and sneeze, providing handkerchiefs and trash cans, preparing for telework and working hours, and working hours.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they no longer have a fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms. Employees must be allowed to stay at home for at least 24 hours without the use of febrifuges or other medications that act on symptoms. They also advise employees to apply flexible policies to
According to OSHA, jobs at medium exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact, within six feet (1.8 m), with people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to an area with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes the provision of workers' safety and security at work, the provision of workers' safety at work, the provision of workers' safety at work, the provision of workers' safety at work, the provision of workers' safety at work, the provision of workers' safety at work, the provision of workers' safety at work, the provision of workers' safety at work, the provision of workers' safety at work, and the provision of workers' safety at work.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to wear respiratory masks.
If a person becomes ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include: separating the patient from others by a distance of 6 feet, designating a crew member to care for the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient, or asking the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching organic fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items shall be disposed of in a bag intended for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls shall include postponement of travel in the event of illness as well as self-isolation and other on-board symptoms.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the lone person's cabin. For schools and child care facilities, CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the case of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as canceling educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals at the canteen, increasing the space between offices, staggering the arrival and departure times, reducing non-essential visitors and presenting symptoms.
In the case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays can be considered. For law enforcement agencies that perform routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to come into contact with persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as paramedics, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before reuse using a household detergent wipe or spray and follow standard procedures for confining and disposing of used PPE as well as confining and washing clothes.
OSHA considers certain health and funeral workers to be in categories with a high or very high risk of exposure.
Occupations at high risk of exposure include health care delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or take or manipulate samples from patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
Funeral jobs at high risk of exposure include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of their death; they go to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical checks of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when performing procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain sanitary and funeral settings.
Samples shall be handled using Level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working within 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing procedures that produce aerosols.
In the United States, N95 NIOSH-approved or higher filtration respiratory masks must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adaptation, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and improved worker comfort. The WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
The WHO recommends that surgical masks be worn only by screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transporting COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles or face shield, gown and gloves.
In the case of a procedure producing aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, the WHO recommends to limit the need for PPE to multiple patients through the use of telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, to limit access to a premises occupied by a COVID-19 patient to those directly involved in his or her care, the use of PPE necessary for the specific task only, the continued use of the same PPE to remove the respiratory mask without the use of the PPE.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Lightening the burden and preparing for the future
SEND DATE/TIME: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC

We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have for each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the kind of global empathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testament to the incredible human beings we are fortunate to work with.
I could not be more grateful and proud to count you all among my colleagues.
Last week, someone expressed their gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the moment, and the strong symbol that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you keep the sites operational, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make substantial adjustments to the way we work together starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned above, the C-Team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the days and months ahead.
During this conversation, we considered what we believe would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
We wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don’t worry.
To all staff, contractors and contractors:
Our daily working time target will be about 4 hours per day, i.e. 20 hours per week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, shop or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't keep an eye on your hours.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please inform Bryan of the T&amp;C Ops department so that the T&amp;C will help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from management.)
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to fulfilling our responsibilities to our subcontractors and fellow hourly staff.
Everyone will be remunerated on the basis of their usual working hours performed under normal conditions.
This is true if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to get rid of their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to contact your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are certain things that we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Confidence & Security & Fundraising (among others) teams are doing essential work that may need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments in order to evaluate the current objectives and focus on supporting the fundamental tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most indispensable projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to “work twice as hard to make up for lost time” when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to establish new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time targets, we plan to adjust the timeframe for delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to establish a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to have their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps upon confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of an excess of caution, we called on an antiviral cleanup team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington D.C. office is located in a WeWork premises, which has shared with us and all Washington D.C.-based staff its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington D.C. office has adopted a fully remote setup in accordance with San Francisco’s advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed renting a business in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to working remotely are aware that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reduce the length of meetings to sessions of one or two hours maximum.
If longer sessions are needed, consider spreading them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send documentation in advance.
Make videos the norm, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and speaker list, and someone to help take notes (or take a collective note).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headphones.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Join the #remotices channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We have explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to carry out their agreed-upon grant activities and that no one would be penalized if these objectives were delayed or changed.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness in the face of upheaval and relief in the face of clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the follow-up, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Staying in touch despite COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
Until then, you can still find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all the information in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a significant workflow or coverage issues, or if you need help with anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and liaise if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please email Bryan Judah, Director of Global International HR Operations.
None of these changes should be considered a waiver of our work and obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of acknowledging that at present our work and our obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we consider necessary to support each other and continue our work, provide our movement with the help it needs, and provide the world with the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
We need each and every one of you to achieve this, which is why you must preserve yourself and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself when the time comes.
Finally, please, wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme linked to the outer face (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point in the cells of some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminated peptidase domain M2 and a C-terminated renal amino acid-carrying collectrin domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, whose enzymatically active domain is exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is linked to the cell membrane mainly cells of the pulmonary alveoli type II, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate for the ACE.
ACE cleaved the hormone angiotensin I into vasoconstrictive angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxyl-terminated phenylamine amino acid of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis to vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Pro-His).
ACE2 can also cleave several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus behind SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus behind COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spicule protein S1 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and in the translocation of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of the protein S by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of the latter is currently being investigated as a potential treatment, which leads some to believe that the reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can help to fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard treatment using ACE inhibitor and ARB.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 demonstrated that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects."
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher risk of pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure victims.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less conclusive than for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
The recombinant human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is believed to be an innovative treatment for severe lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time to action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors or for diseases with high circulation of angiotensin II. Infusion rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons (“contacts”) likely to have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, particularly those based on tracking the geographic location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an app in China that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities and Singapore has opted for an app called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local community of computer scientists, it has been provided in open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched “StopKorona!”, a Bluetooth app that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was pending approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the contact tracing application was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are planning to implement applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and based on the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geotagging application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, discussed several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiency if only a small portion of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” apps, Apple only allows “official” or generally trustworthy organizations to add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have raised concerns about the mass surveillance implications of coronavirus applications, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have stipulated eight conditions to be met in the framework of government projects:
Monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
the extensions of control and surveillance should include extinguishing clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19 targets;
Data security and anonymity should be demonstrably protected;
Digital surveillance should ensure that discrimination and marginalisation are not exacerbated;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined by law;
protections against abuse and remedies for citizens in the event of abuse should be provided;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent monitoring by removing the OS tracking mechanism from their devices as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems based on central servers need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers solely for intercommunication, which is privacy-friendly (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used for contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, which they then associated in order to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government has also made location information publicly available, which was allowed as a result of profound changes to information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralised privacy systems.
The details had not yet been communicated on April 6, 2020.
Privacy-friendly contact tracing is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data as early as 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), and Privacy Sensitive Protocols.
These protocols ensure that personally identifiable data never leaves the device and that all matching takes place on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique builds on the findings of the Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic white paper published in March 2020. Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at the MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising confidentiality.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key factor in their adoption by a wide audience.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the release of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative, declaring that it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with privacy-enhancing cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Deployment of tools for governments to create official privacy-friendly coronavirus tracking applications
Direct integration of this feature in iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address issues of solution adoption and persistent monitoring by initially distributing the system through operating system updates and later deleting it in the same way once the threat is removed.
The repositioning of a drug (also called reorientation, reprofiling, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) refers to the reconversion of a drug approved for a disease or medical condition different from the one for which it was initially developed.
This is an area of scientific research currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of plasma from convalescent individuals.SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has several ligand-binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites offers the realistic project of developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (U.S.A.).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and is licensed under the U.S.A. only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage, or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have indicated using this medication “when there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
More extensive studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days among the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in favor of the drug is thin and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for the Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those attempting to procreate.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that “no benefit was observed”.
These drugs have been designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections, and Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies before the trial suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one involving people with moderate disease and one involving those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
An angiotensin-converting enzyme form 2, a phase II trial is underway with 200 patients being recruited from hospitalized severe cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults aged 40 years and older who have been diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or lactating women or women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian drug agency to issue guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study involving 300 patients and studying the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccines have passed clinical trials, many developmental attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, was expected for at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing a Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic broke out around the world in 2020, prompting significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Primary platform targets for Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As stated by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) are confirmed as active and 37 others are announced, but with little public information available (assumed under planning or design).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and conducted in several centers, all while determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing disease, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active developmental vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human evaluation phase (still in “preclinical” research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular tweezers vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan’s International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced that it has begun work on a vaccine, which is expected to start human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it has begun work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neoantigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.
On March 25, the director of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and that they were starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it has started a vaccine project to create a vaccine based on Ii-Key peptides against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both located in western Maryland, announced work on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a partnership with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced preclinical test projects and a phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even under accelerated procedure, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle through partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is being researched in the laboratory, with human tests scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large sums of money to benefit from exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine,” prompting protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an mRNA-based vaccine.
The BNT162 mRNA vaccine candidate is currently in preclinical testing with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a US$ 4.9 million investment in a consortium for the research of a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of the CEVI to US$ 29 million in the development of a COD.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-boosting RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the sequence being sent by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of C$192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with projects to create a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if further coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that “microneedle-administered SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine subunits triggered an important response of antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immune response.”
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, paired with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 health professionals.
It is possible that vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need to implement Level 3 biosecurity containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing research on SARS could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, a single MERS (DNA-based) vaccine had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three more were in progress; all vaccines were viral-vector, two adenoviral-vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have spread a conspiracy theory that the virus that caused COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited in various social media publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of taste, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases generate moderate symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and failure of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have healed. The virus spreads mainly during close contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Since these droplets are produced at exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than pose an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease.The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing the mask by the public generally vary, with some authorities not recommending its use, others recommending its use, and still others requiring its use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking, and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to see a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, failure of several organs, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be as long as 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and under study.The Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
China’s National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; out of 166 infections seen today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both sputum and saliva can carry significant viral loads.
Speaking loudly releases more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without protecting yourself can throw droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside of patients' rooms produced positive samples to viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause airborne spread.
Although there are concerns about spread through the stool, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread may be possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others. The virus survives for hours or even days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective when used properly; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, disabling it and removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease outbreak.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in naturally related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) which is most abundant in the alveolar type II cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called a spicule (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and penetrate the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan hospital, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be linked to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis.Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have shown diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF-secreting T cells have been associated with recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at the autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by nasopharyngeal sampling; however, nasal or sputum sampling may also be used.
Generally, results are available within a few hours or even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world were able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (likely to detect active infections and a person's previous infection) were being developed, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience revealed an accuracy of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first closest-to-patient test on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobed bilateral frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of infection.
Pleural dominance, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur with disease progression.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIVC); leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of your elbow in the absence of a tissue.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering the face with tissue in public places to limit transmission to asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel, and cancelling large groupings.
Distance guidelines also include respecting a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There are no drugs known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Given that a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key element of managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after biting, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulae, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol, it is "not an antiseptic active substance for hands".
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are treated by supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy, and support from other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analyzed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatments can be useful in those who have moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Resuscitation physicians and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled therapeutic recommendations from several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Regarding symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in care conditions where procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health care professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an airborne infection-friendly isolation chamber (AIRI) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne transmission precautions. The CDC emphasizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment during airborne transmission.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (face masks) are preferred.
N95 Respiratory Masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unindicated uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or as a last resort, handmade masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided using a high-throughput nasal cannula or double-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either or both of them generate the same benefits for people in a critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-throughput nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to treat a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs being tested are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral drug can be tried in people suffering from a severe disease.
The WHO recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments, and the FDA granted a temporary authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect “close contacts” using monitoring data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. Mobile phone data massive data analytics, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at enforcing quarantine and protecting people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who are not in their 40s.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that “40 percent of people continue to move”.
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global appeal to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease can have a moderate course with little or no symptoms, resembling other common respiratory diseases such as the cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are lacking. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Clotting disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of cases hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal failure observed in 4% of people in this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, including five days in hospital.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung looks like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission, heart damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had pre-existing pathologies, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of disease mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Undercounting moderate cases may lead to overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and were 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die than non-smokers, and there were concerns about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital administration has seen a 20% to 30% drop in respiratory capacity in some people cured of the disease, and lung scans suggest organ damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether a previous infection provided effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of people cured of COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus testing at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet found that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 U07.1 emergency pathological codes for laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 case deaths without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death/case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of deaths.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the rate of lethality (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die of the disease and the rate of infectious lethality (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed or not) who die of a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and all COVID-19-related deaths may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, according to an evaluation of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to be related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among men in their fifties, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at age 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The precise reasons for this difference between the sexes are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors may be among them.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women and the development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of people who died of COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not collecting data associated with the gender of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health care workers, particularly nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be “COVID-19”.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigma.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” in its public communication.
The disease and the virus are both commonly referred to as the coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as “Coronavirus” and “Wuhan Coronavirus.”
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV Temporary Disease Names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive Against the Use of Places in Disease and Virus Names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed a respirator valve in an emergency and the supplier could not supply it in a timely manner, a local startup back-designed and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
After the initial COVID-19 epidemic, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that humans are able to spread the disease to certain other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE 2 receptor to penetrate human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response of the human body in case of new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spicle S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of vaccines based on nucleic acids (vaccination by DNA or RNA, a new technique for creating vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from all of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs make up the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials of redesivir in several countries expected to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of clinical development of vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta-associated lopinavir/ritonavir.
Provisional data suggest the efficacy of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with redesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of the research work.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that double that dose is highly dangerous and could be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of physicians caring for COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spiculate protein priming with serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry via interaction with the EC2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without additional studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine shock can be a complication in later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic anti-shock properties.Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is currently undergoing a phase 2 non-randomised national trial in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to be causing the death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cells treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have cured of COVID-19 to people who need them is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody-based treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of convalescent serum, made up of the liquid part of the blood of patients cured and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, then contracted COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
