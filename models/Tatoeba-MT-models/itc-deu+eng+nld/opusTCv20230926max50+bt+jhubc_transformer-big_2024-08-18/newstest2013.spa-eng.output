A Republican Strategy to Impede Obama's Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that election fraud is less prevalent in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of American governments enacted, as of 2009, new laws that made the registration or voting process difficult.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011, 180 bills were introduced restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day, and remove the right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
As a result, Republican officials rushed to extend the practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by their state government agency.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have an identity card with a photograph.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who most vote for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to do so.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers backed in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of polling in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wished to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored shortening the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter represented no more than 13% of the state’s voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the same thing happened.
These represent no more than 11% of voters, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who make up 76% of the electorate, represent no more than 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photograph.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, since it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these electoral system-wide legislative changes will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Getting Tested or Not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant in themselves, doubt whether or not screening tests should be done.
To take the test or not?
We asked for advice from two specialists.
Studies in the United States detected a high rate of contagion among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who did not.
The study, with follow-up at age 12, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of suffering from metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend testing from age 50, or from age 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer. They should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not threaten long-term life, in which case they should opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, as cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We are increasingly determining precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not you should have the test.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits are still the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
In contrast, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people’s health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The Peso
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon, and rectal cancer, esophageal, pancreatic, and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer,” they add.
The Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, they escalate the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
At the moment, however, his research is inconclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of discussing each other’s concerns and family history with their doctor.
"Doing the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson sparked a major shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in effect, that this boson is a participant in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What’s more, it’s the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or “less bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it’s not entirely clear that it’s Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to confirm that it is, although more data is still lacking to be completely sure.
Anyway, we assume it's Higgs, since the chances of getting it wrong seem slim.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law which implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because you'll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: Pauli's exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" consisting, roughly speaking, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can meet in the same place and at the same time.
According to The Particle Adventure website of Berkeley Laboratories that, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature are propagated and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, I would underline here, are not the exotic bugs we might believe.
In fact, if he manages to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily trivial boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field, and to activate it it requires reaching extremely high energies, a bit like an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide over the surface.
That’s why it takes an immense particle accelerator like CERN (the big hadron collider is a ring 27 km in circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand by itself glued to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
What can all these investigations "provide"? asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and predictions of the MS.
For their part, many fervently want them to meet, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that plugs certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we haven’t found such differences at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such research on our day-to-day lives are hard to predict, but we don’t think we’re wrong in saying it won’t have any.
In the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution their work would bring about.
They saw the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, said, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Just imagine...
And in addition, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light collector in 1969 in the course of his research into optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this pickup now serves as an "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That’s not to say, of course, that the LHC’s activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
In its Dying in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir tried to get a closer look at him.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year break.
“I had been given five years to live, but I’ve been like this for seven years,” he says, making a pass, lying on his bed in the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resignation to be helped to eat.
Brave, he even gets to smile, to talk to strangers who devote attention to him, bring him medicines and offer him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
“My biggest wish is to be cured of my diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
“In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees on his feet,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Going back to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the big moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer “curative” care.
The biggest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die "consciously and drowned".
But the disease has made her discover her children.
“I have good children,” he adds.
“I don’t have any desires left in this life anymore,” she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the coming days, a last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care that is given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying are offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, according to the lawsuit.
Diabetics are no longer controlled for their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being the same.
Alongside a 94-year-old man who savors his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows as everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after having tried everything to survive.
“Since six months ago, there are always three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who are sick with cancer,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care facility.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montréal’s home palliative care society, specialize almost exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack in Quebec health care that makes many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," she says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering great pain without having done what was necessary to relieve it.
I’m afraid patients want to die just because they don’t get the proper care.”
And in parallel, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s hopes for survival were already low when she left exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that she wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not attending to their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it has to be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want relief.”
This report has been made possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters are part.
An "industry" that became too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system is pulverized once we’ve hunted the big media,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of the Montreal police force.
He led the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by an in-depth investigation into embezzlement linked to road contracts in Quebec, which then-Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had only agreed to delay.
The “Duchesneau report” established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved $1 billion in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to keep a proportionate share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, while hoping to be able to "demonstrate the existing stratagems behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of auditors, researchers and government analysts.
This unit works in addition to the "Marteau Squadron" police officers, who, since 2009, have made Montreal's "sewer cartel" moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to the serial registration of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and Italian-born entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock when explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito handed out money right and wrong during the 2000s, awarding more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation in the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills by between 30 and 40 percent for fake extras.
In addition, a mayor’s party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a side budget and filling his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land purchased for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money
Of the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she says she pulls "a thread to be able to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
And he adds that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We are cleaning up the wounds but we would need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that dubious practices do not repeat themselves.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned above all about the role of the "elected politicians aware of the ploy".
Estimated at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was spent on campaign finance in Quebec, he ironically: “I’ve been told that that’s nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete review of the system of public procurement and party financing: "we cannot fall lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I walk by your side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything is going very fast in football.
But I don't worry.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always made great strides.
You will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is backed by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
- Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like him in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very reassuring conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of PSG in the first half of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken our lead position.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the round of 16 in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to start, to finish the first of our league against Porto to be able to receive the round of 16 of the final.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.
For now, that is not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is committed to making this project a reality.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
In the last season we didn’t get very far.
In May we got a disappointment, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expect more from PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, they still find things to blame us for is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We tried to start a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have not managed to qualify for the round of 16, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the inverted sums, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage per day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better say we have a "Zlatandependence".
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and has a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's the star of League One.
And he has shown in every team he has gone through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to take part in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I can play good games in the national team.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is because today we have an exemplary behavior.
What vision do you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "bleus"?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the team to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn’t experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
In contrast to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing burdens between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer to peer.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been registered thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The price of bitcoin, having reached the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today to around ten dollars (quotes are counted on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not at all impressive if we compare it with world exchange rates in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credits", used to advance a video game and which can be won by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both bookkeepers, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the form of an email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are in the public ledger, which is spread throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge thrown to computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
It is a phase of file splitting, that is, of transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "cutting" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (plus zeros at first).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very fast (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would be orphaned, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is split in two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the one hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins on deposit have been stolen.
“The failure used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Heavy actors such as Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, the "giant sales" were launched.
“$30,000 was exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Their system, Paytunia, equates to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to start up in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, should this currency succeed.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops abandoned their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished, above all, the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to the French credits, was made by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by the helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx into Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for obscurantism from their farmers overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in a lower position.
Major figures in the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking over government land to resell as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
The people, as I have heard in the camp, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With around 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We will have to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is avid for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish brochures presenting a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the position of prime minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly in the context of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been repaired or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to take over them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper ores from the soil and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the province’s most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, will also need to re-establish normal relations.
The French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, children's schools, a department of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and had brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain towns.
These jobs, eager to obtain local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultivation areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military expenditure?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of the local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid that would reach them directly.
A constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
It caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And for almost two years, Egypt has been using an interim text, repeatedly modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial turmoil.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his “autocratic delusion” and continues to “betray his word” and “treat the law.”
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis faster and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as the controversy wreaks havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "Either they vote for my text or I retain the full powers", powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in the vast majority, voted for the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 substitute members were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles voted were unanimous.
The commentators are pleased, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all eyes, remains finally identical to the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "rules", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm his or her compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of liberals are also heightened by the fact that the next rector of the university would be much less moderate than the current one.
“For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on that text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
“We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to rule on all of this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy remains and henceforth insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to go on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this “baptismal pile” will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the pacification of the storm and the full nets.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Via Crucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins at the Fortress of Anthony, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, going to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of Anointing and the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree of which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the holiest place for the Jews, the Wailing Wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will then come true.
Take a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, can only those who dedicate themselves to climbing.
The others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
There, from the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain allegedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
In a single trip you won’t be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has paintings by Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dal<0xC3><0xAD>.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they ring the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
Israel’s three main tourist areas lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop by 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing muds and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It was the famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets bearing the names of the zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently 1-3$,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travelling on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transshipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning a new work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are balls of ground chickpeas, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that "walk to their liking" in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The purveyors love the crowded places and do not reject the treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) a day.
In addition to insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And the rental of a bicycle will come out for 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds by 51% at the same rate of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
'The Great and Powerful' Takes You to Moscow: Immigrants Save for Language
While MPs and human rights defenders discuss the consequences that the law would bring on the mandatory examination, scammers who trade with "false" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law has been in force, according to which each immigrant worker will have to take an exam to verify his knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service provision sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to take the exam of the language, if not also that of Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The exception is citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who obtained their education certificates and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, Fatality and Defense of Rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to present themselves for the tests in all the cities, right now in Russia more than 160 centers of this type are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the obligatory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will allow to reduce the number of people who suffer "labor slavery".
Many people are talking today about defending the rights of working immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Immigration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language and do not pass medical check-ups.
Without an understanding of the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the guise of helping, put him on a “pay trip” to a creepy, narrow swarm, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages,” Tolib Sharipov, head of the Tajik Immigration Service’s Labour Immigration Directorate, said in a statement.
Don't get mad, boss!
Meanwhile, however, many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention already dressing them, wearing them shoes and buying them what they need for school.
As they reach adolescence, these guys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if you do not know the language, they recognize.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as language law is concerned, rights defenders point to an important point.
The exams will be held only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or Forbidden Passage to Strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only fifteen hundred rubles.
Employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several "false" certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who could not have successfully passed the exam the first time more time to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to the owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government’s reaction to the recent incidents: squeezing shots during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which squeezing seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a licence to carry weapons from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the gun ownership law will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the “hard-handed policy”.
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless rigor" be desisted.
The percentage of vandalism using registered weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov told Russia’s BBC news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared to a total of 1,168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to target the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to official
The black market for weapons is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website accepting gun orders
The first, "army or military vestige", i.e. weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon", those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were intentionally caused to cover up the fault,” one former military official said.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also lay their sand granite.
“Private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market have now proliferated and distribute under-the-rope weapons to the black market, including Moscow,” he said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market guns have arrived there “due to officials whose work is related to guns,” the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places where there is armed conflict, 14% of cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The gun store clerk, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says guns found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers target military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some ensign, the supplier purchases a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
“He takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers,” he tells us.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when it comes to complying with the crime discovery plan, they make trial purchases from illegal arms dealers,” he added.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
“I visited websites and blogs until a guy proposed me to go to the ‘Begovaya’ platform, where I would be a man who would take me to a ‘squinita’ where we could negotiate.
Of the price of the gun, I only found out there.”
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
“To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts,” says the store clerk. “I have a friend like that, but I don’t trust him very much.”
In the markets there are sellers, but there you also have to arrive, say "on behalf of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that a tooth had fallen off his daughter."
I can even get a pair of steel cuffs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to betray him.
Novices look for weapons in different ways.
Former militaryman Viktor Baranets was put to the test as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was "nothing at all".
“I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,” he recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered cat by hare: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
Sofas shop
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the ad headline, “Buying a gun or machine gun.”
There users place their orders and ask questions.
Are they selling to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n" (conserved spelling).
"I buy gun TT. Moscow", laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures on two hands those who wish to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish, to the bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia
Military and Former Military Commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send you a photo and instructions so you know where the gun is hidden,” said Dmitry Kislov, the press secretary for the NGO “The Right to Arms.”
Viktor Baranets claims that if you place an order online, you run out of guns and are put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures on two hands those who wish to buy firearms.
“And people go, like hungry fish, to the bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
It will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, constituting 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike
Up to a quarter of U.S. teens find their first jobs as ATMs at "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against the low wages paid at Walmart supermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and tame in its early stages.
The protests are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the rise in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those in the fast food system, the goal of the organizers of the protests is the creation of workers’ unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday". That day, in the United States began the orgy of sales that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
That day, some workers at the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the corporation, whose products target people with modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or handheld scanners.
That "Black Friday" rally participants demanded increased wages and complained that the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than what you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the pay rise on consumers’ shoulders, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased that the protest took place in only nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
Black Friday lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company’s representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that “fewer than five” Walmart employees left their jobs and that the protest had been “another PR stunt” organized by the workers’ union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city have no appreciation for them, and so for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it’s possible to survive in New York with that money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teens walked past McDonald’s and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble upon some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them with.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food chefs start paying at least $15 an hour, or double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers’ unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from impeding this right and punishing union movement activists with wits and firings.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their life easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is excessive staff turnover.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's located near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, for example from the city’s mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must support fast-food workers to achieve fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York work.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
“For now, fooling the brain isn’t that easy.”
The subject of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is recently normally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft’s Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, it became clear that for the company’s scientists, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world of computing must be liberated from ours, from the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, fuck with those silly virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course it can not be considered a panacea, it remains pending to resolve the issue of privacy, since we do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device’s camera, but by a wristband that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- What's that like?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- That is, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can not do at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Are they lacking resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects human-machine interaction.
To me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible fingerboard sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the location curvature of the cameras, and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that, from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smartphone in your hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is their strength (private things only you will be able to see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the film "Iron Man", but also to any simple mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly geared towards bringing tangibility to these "images in the air", for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone were blowing it on the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he seems he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that they are going to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, who find many things in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg Vanguardism", dedicated to the citizens in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of the art and scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even Russia knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely St. Petersburg socio-philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s - early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organelle and became the organist of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray provokes aggression and agitation of properties not good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I befriended artists of the new wave, with the subsequent ones being exhibited in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I joined the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
It was important to me to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to meet.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical arts club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to “Van Gogh’s Ear”.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training was received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov Club", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regular customers were there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was made in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very uncultivated.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them is clearly expressed the actuality and the occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns everything gets soaked up and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by clothing, orienting oneself on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, perhaps, that person should not even shake his hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed when you change clothes.
- We recently saw you in the role of urban organizer. - A cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Fine, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have tact.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simplones others.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov they come by the thousands!
- The abandoned ones will see it, there the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event go 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When I was young I made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end with.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that’s another story.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is a concept: culture officer.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were the right ones everything was different, kings might not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who may well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level to properly evaluate them and open their way.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a St. Petersburg grant.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set off in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments with plants were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, the Drosophila.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent to the space to check how the embryo develops under conditions of weightlessness.
As a result, we get a normal chick.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, the laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they could not find support, the chicks turned around randomly.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
“And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left because it was impossible to work there with them,” comments Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological miniarch flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our gull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question,” says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a child.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, astronauts are counted who after long flights have done well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even on orbital flights," summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
Under conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is its native element.
The small amphibian-men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, since it will be easier to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the time of birth until the time of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swim monitor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation, the force of gravity, is necessary.
In weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepitate very quickly, the expulsion capacity of the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omit that, relying on the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, this will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress in a special suit for training, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled, a totally misfit person,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, as humans on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their spaceborn children.
Head of NK<0xC3><0x9A>: Inspection of the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system has not found the guilty politician
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application is lame.
Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NK<0xC3><0x9A>), said in an interview with Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," thus describes the current situation.
The joint controls of Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as's attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDG (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So is it forbidden or allowed?
“The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks or demand obligations,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and German team, in the framework of which the legislation on public awards in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel check we started about two years ago.
To put it simply: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, followed by the legislation in force in each country and then the practice itself.
We have put everything together and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is confirmed, therefore, that it is not enough to incorporate ever stricter rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think are the conclusions?
It is precisely a common control of this kind that could help us to stop investing efforts in the implementation of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of saving means getting a suitable thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to thus avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But it is not by reducing the limit of the allocations that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "papel" that those who want to look for faults in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation that regulates the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized in a different way?
As for the offices, such as the NK<0xC3><0x9A>, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors) acts there, with an organization similar to ours, with a college too, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also somewhat analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organisation, the courts of account are even at this level, and in this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, what we here call state funds.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to draw a comparison without concrete data, but Germany is still a model in some respects, but it is not possible to specify exactly what is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of inspectors?
Of course not, but I don’t like to make that kind of comparison.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model have to face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, you wouldn't benefit from working with our office, would you?
As far as the legislation of our country is concerned, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean to your Office?
Given that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet manifested itself in the control actions.
Since we carry out ex post checks, we need to have a certain delay.
For now, it is seen in the process of preparing future controls: we have initiated a new tool for "detection of non-economic risks", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and similar.
Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that can arise is that the regulation "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each law not respected in the field of public procurement meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to tighten the law this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this initiated path takes us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA1>varc system, with reference to the fact that it is autonomous only on paper.
Is the <0xC5><0xA1>varc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way, and if it prohibits anything, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office which has the obligation to carry out such checks and to demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and we allow it," but you can't say we'll do as if nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how to act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice plates, although most are passable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most routes are passable, caution should be exercised in some.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will range between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Metallic Mountains, snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region’s road operations control center.
The R6 expressway and the first-class road in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
All second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with remnants of ice and crushed snow.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports the Directorate of Roads and Highways.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frosts can occur in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysokého M<0xC3><0xBD>ta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains from Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow pounded on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will today be between clear and partly cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three below zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable today morning, although extreme caution must be exercised and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some pathways could also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from the information of the control center of road operations of the region.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the track between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most top-notch roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the road to Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany there may be stretches with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case, ice-plate sections are also warned.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less busy roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Road operators cleared the snow overnight; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, snow remains.
Drivers at the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské will encounter half-discarded snow in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," a <0xC5><0xA0>umper road operator told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also came to the Jesenick<0xC3><0xA1> and, after the chemical treatment, the slopes of the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are unrestricted, on the <0xC5><0xA0>ternbersk<0xC3><0xA1> road drivers should drive with caution on forest stretches, where the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region and Liberec region
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different stretches early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road, but in the lowest areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
There have been no service complications.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from the general roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec regions.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched over the road with the weight of snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many other scare stories that we like to hold on to.
The Tap Tap music group we rather like to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state charity that we have been planning for the past two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar set for December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20th at 9 pm, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we forged the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, along with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "End of the world, canceled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can it be heard at charity concerts?
Of course, yes, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time at all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked together simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, besides organizing many charitable events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised at concerts against the end of the world go to?
An equipment for the barrier-free school Studeo, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ustav.
The students of Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ustav school regularly receive visits from teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
The students do not have sufficient financial means to pay the teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ustav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any other similar “spectacular action” in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, until now you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not cease to surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you met so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still not frequent for a person to move alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created that strives to thematicize the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what respects should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to travel on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, it will begin to change everything for real.
Until now, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I joined as an educator in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ustav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not reach until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also actively work to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that you can do something else.
The world of entertainment is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is accepted with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we must have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it’s not just a step forward for them, but for society as a whole.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you, help?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something done.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We are an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has will and will will always find the doors open.
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together The Tap Tap's song "End of the World, Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise the necessary resources to finance the multifunctional equipment of the barrier-free STUDEO educational center in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav in Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entry in the early sale option on Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA, the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency’s project commission.
However, Poland’s path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw astronomical observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a major driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters on the hidden face of the moon.
As early as 1925 in Poland was built a dresina that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and neither are the highlights of the project known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the drag or for braking.
The information about this dressin is limited to the press collection of the time.
From 1933 Polish artillery began to devote itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the investigation reached the stage of practical evidence.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In the year 1937 appeared in the specialized press the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, society is referred to for the first time with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
By this time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA was significantly involved in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) rocket probe, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg of weight.
Later, construction of the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial testing of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was going to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was going to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
In 1962, however, work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum apogee in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, and its first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Later the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek.
Suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with rampant financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour cost (wage) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this "causes a decrease" of the competitor's price in order to take over most of the market and, in this way, increase its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing, the result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and thus is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
All this situation promotes the total disinterest of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damages that they have caused in their desire to obtain profits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees with regard to labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with widening gaps between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already reaching one million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: employed people with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of practically all the southern states of the EU lead, without a doubt, to the same situation: People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to live with a terrible salary on the edge of society, in the hope that someday private investor capital will arrive in the country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the satiety that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that running the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its egoism the political march and, therefore, the whole state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the realm of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: state ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission the drafting of bills to private legal companies, which are often linked to industry.
Such bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power emanates not from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation like that described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for some time and the administrations were occupied by force."
In exchange for bribes, illegitimately obtained favors and help to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread without any impediment and the people went to the polls with the vote applauded beforehand "... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be serious that the only remedy for such a serious situation was the Appegeros and the autocratic.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today’s society is based on unconsidered preferences for individual benefit without regard for common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole of society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without any effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and more recent history.
The suspension of the law on public adjudication is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution involves concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are".
“If my children did not want wars, there would be none,” Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, various reactions have arisen.
One, on Israel’s side, argues for the right of self-defense and squares the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, the other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and denounces Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the periodic killings and who is the victim. After all, today’s citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a behind-the-scenes look, a look to find out who is taking advantage of the tensions that have dragged on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have come to on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity the history of the struggles for power is in the front row.
In every age we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
In the nineties of the nineteenth century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschild Bank of America, began printing money during the American Civil War and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their eagerness for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Freemason Albert Pike, decorated with the degree 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the third aimed to reduce the population of the land between half a million and a billion people (similar numbers of slaves for their welfare and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a final solution).
The method by which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the triggering of crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao – order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation, if not, just remember that the Fed was created so that a crisis like the one in 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francis Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the onset of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a covert way, a conflicting situation in the wake of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough to serve the Germans the solution of the Führer, which was so simple and so strong.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundation for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which the international bankers had tied him at first or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus for a third war was created.
If the international bankers managed to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how Israel's sympathizers and detractors are sharply divided.
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of it all was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the world Strait of Hormuz, through which passes only 20% of all the world’s oil.
In what light are now the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their whole being.
And it compels everyone, big and small, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on their right hand or forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers on his forehead, let him add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo Movie: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist student protesters occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Reza P<0xC3><0xA1>hlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation offered no positive prospect: throwing the shah overboard could not be allowed, since, if it did, it jeopardized the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the US, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter’s defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck themed an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for which a covert story helped an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew examining the location in the country for the filming of a sci-fi superproduction.
Combination of genders
The plan drawn up by "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production company even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example may be the series Ocean's Eleven).
In the film the moods are combined. On the one hand we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are shown emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were embodied in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes slightly lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And besides, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: dressed men analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been teased, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he was raised.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed directors of old movies above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is “rolling” in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic ability that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the bewilderment and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here everything doesn’t come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis lurks at the Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its track become insane).
The weakness of Argo is the uncontrollability that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s film loses a bit of a dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, valuing its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But if it collapses, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
“We came up with this after the last event, and the EU is planning to approve a 40 percent share of women in management positions in major European companies,” said Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Patrik Nacher, the survey organiser.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women have benefited from better prices in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk.
“Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by people until the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the EU regulations at issue is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline darkens the size of the hen cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the removal of the classic light bulb from shops has been criticised.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The EU apparatus often makes such decisions under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas should be at least 14 centimeters long in the EU and could not have "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that with this it only seeks to harmonize the national rules not homogenized to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of groceries.
The candidate to win the poll could be last year’s EU prescription that inflatable balloons that are marketed is mandatory to warn that children under 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The U.S. referred here to an American study according to which, when talking about toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death from suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to the use of mother-in-law mats by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, we must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, named in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
Afterwards, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volume for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of a substantial fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for grants.
Such ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
“We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation," then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) said in the autumn of 2004.
He argued this with the fact that in our country there was a lot of cereal production and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often the target of criticism, the EU’s regulatory efforts and also more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which member states have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs, as well as other countries in the Union, are also affected by the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even though our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc cheese, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the nineteenth century, and became called "tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the worldwide known feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the marzipan of the German city Lübeck or the Parma ham, there are already the biscuits of Karlovy Vary, the carp of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> and even the variety of l.
As EU protected maras, you can be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice v Podkrkono<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD> boats.
People want me to save the republic, but I’m an amateur, Okamura says
Senator, how did you come up with running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If all was well in our country, then I would not submit my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how it has been stolen in our country for the last twenty years, how thieves go unpunished, taxes are raised and the retirement age is raised.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I’m already forty and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has set itself on its way to the presidency.
Aren’t you turning your back on the people who voted for you?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
I later made it clear that if I were elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to start a change.
To this is added the media, which discredits you and confuses freedom of expression with freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an advisor to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over twenty million.
To do this, the law must change.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I was part of a lobby group to make the job of guide recognized as self-employment, and we did it.
The problem lies in politics: if someone arrives with a good proposal, either from the right or from the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without encapsulations or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn’t matter to me, whether it’s a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we move forward.
I don’t care if someone is right or left, I want to unite people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the SDGs and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
He's joking when he says you're a populist.
But aren't you proving it with what you're saying?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament there are only slogans left.
And it cannot survive in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want to.
If there is a strong character who points out disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Take for instance the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I’ve just started in politics and I’m trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to get things going myself, but in case it doesn’t go well, in six years I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, which is why I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who brought to light the frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I’m on the scales.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did did voted for representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I have not yet considered it because I do not have time for it, to check the blameless past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
Talk about property statements, how's yours?
I estimate my private property at about $60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a floor valued at ten million, another floor valued at eight million, a collection of artworks worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youthful dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at $60 million and you don’t have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to be in debt?
In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there isn’t much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign with money out of my own pocket.
The campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a senator's salary.
For example, I could not pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 kronor a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn’t run as a candidate.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to stop this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I have promised, I have partly left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
People would want me to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I still win.
If I were president, then I'd quit business.

Architecture studio MVRDV proves that true adventures are not just in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "mountain of books"- 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "Also, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
No one enters these old-fashioned libraries for pleasure, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeper town on the outskirts of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, boasts the dubious honor of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges that appear represented on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how policymakers decided that there was only one way to improve the statistics: we had to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar charts and responsible for funny as well as cynical buildings, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked around in perplexity and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here it is, my proposal for Spijkenisse’s mountain of books, the so-called ‘Boekenberg’.”
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain rises at the planned location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and semi-detached buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the “Dutch National Wood Award 2012”.
In this way, the small town lacking history, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather guess a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese tree.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with their topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to embrace with the view, the annealed brick floor and the elegant streetlights unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
As you look up you can see the park benches, dogs and children playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Usually the book shelves are arranged along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade and in the center opens a huge dark room which is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is put up the classic spatial configuration and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well exploited: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that take on the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
Sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is how one day, on a Frisian farm, we came across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands, a few millimeters thick plastic fabric has been used as the basis for holding the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to obtain plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafe you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but also in it you can enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and its ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the appropriate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
“Although it’s hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology,” says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge crystal pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden trusses located transverse to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Likewise, the professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain connection with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved great success in that discipline that in specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany said it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status at the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to prove its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is because he is currently reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a US-led policy, so to speak, and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they are still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they have already begun the path towards a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful and not alienate itself from Arab public opinion nor from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it that much importance since it is not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the U.S. by refraining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic break as in the case of Libya.
This may have earned Germany some respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
Instead, the U.S. has been clearly in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I think that the real disparity of opinions does not really have the magnitude that is attributed to it.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that’s precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but they must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to take a European stance.
Of course this is not at all easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it has with Israel.
This has always been a pelagic topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or maybe you still find it hard to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it continues to be difficult for the country to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as a leading actor, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this way, Germany finds itself in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The U.S. influence on European politics is diminishing more and more, but the EU does not fill that void at the moment, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, c'est la vie!

"Mark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real eponyms do not file a claim.
And even then it’s not clear that they’re going to be right.
“Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the firm Taylor Wessing, which specializes in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada he registers Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which he keeps seats from the Beijing trademark office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company applied to register Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying mark.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have “fished” a rich man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
“It’s harmful to the business, you have to fight it,” Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year, China is, in size, the third largest market for luxury goods and the one that grows at the fastest pace.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of doubtful legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can last up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long that the name object of the lawsuit had already become a “market reality.”
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged the plaintiff's trademark in China," Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphical elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why today the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely initially used a blue-and-white logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they had difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the labor emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed claims processes has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is usual in China, the numbers are surprising.
Last year, CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means China leads the list of new enrollments worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed in rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg demonstrates.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the impersonator has managed to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the Munich appeal.
Freudenberg was right in the next two instances, but the opposing party is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending a decision.
Wentzler hoped to be able to resolve the issue favourably and praised the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to one hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "six-figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly settlement, but was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
in particular if the imitators secure there the rights over unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since left this commercial field, but managed to prevent registration.
“You have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend German companies to be extremely prudent when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what must be done is “to register also in China everything that may be susceptible to protection”, as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: dancing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi rehearses and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a link capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heels and loafers look for the compass on the parquet floor, and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (alt, bass, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise, swirling, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his box almost by trying to put order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the homeowner have also arrived.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language barely known: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are approximately 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found sponsors in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school’s tuition, uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "panegirist".
In this room no one knows how to speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision as a good thing, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40 percent of Swaziland’s population carries the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in their early thirties has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this secluded population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than sparse.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since professionally dealt with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs of viral origin are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Lads and scabies are among parasite-borne STDs.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are most common in men who have sex with other men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were recorded in 2011.
That’s one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one be protected?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through dirt infections and through physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend undergoing regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change sexual partners.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for its performances throughout Germany, they raise a lot of money.
"In total, we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman with leadership skills, manages the money sent from Germany.
He takes care of the orphans finding a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof where to live and take care of the children to go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, Voices of Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is evident throughout the country, it is not usually openly spoken of.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
Black Africa’s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and overwhelmed lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the innumerable seasons that travel the country from one side to the other and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "free condoms can be bought in any corner, but these are barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two to three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the era of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a language of blacks; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to tear off a couple of tears from some rabid border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitzheni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small town barely appears on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is well known.
"Come to Esitzheni, there shines the light," the locals say.
And after travelling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence for the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also ice water, as evidenced by three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reportedly found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the permanently shadowed area of the planet.
It seems that this one is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, with great probability, asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one links the finding of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger’s lead researcher Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help shed light on how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult thing to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantically named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This tornado image of an extinct star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope took this photo of the galactic star-forming zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as the Seven Sisters, are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This budding star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.

One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Swirl Galaxy.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the hints of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of merging rock towards each other to end up colliding irretrievably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it by the nickname of Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula at 1,400 light-years away is made up of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and x-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, served for a moment as a model for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone is constantly producing new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars are also continually emerging; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen could be found mostly in the universe.
Our Window to the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have more and more depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope is built.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed lift angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of what it would look like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations for the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers assume that the south pole of Mercury also has ice.
However, there is no reliable evidence, as the Messenger probe rotates around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.

The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus proceeds with great bang through the winding road that passes alongside wooded hills, high-flow rivers and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is located in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
The Talyshi people live here, a village of which not much is known, apart from the fact that they perfectly master Persian and Azeri and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts an architecture perhaps too massive designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit completely in such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists hardly get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate the two urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the World’s Oldest People,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place who have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is sheepshepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies this.
And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov’s age is quite suspicious.
“He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and apparently still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Has <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
“In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan very old people also live,” Scholz says, “even in Sardinia there are many older men.”
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when there is no civil record.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or maybe it is the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, he is relatively young for what he does in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, she tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents a long time ago.
Two young children also jump from one side to the other.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea served in typical cups with a domed shape.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the scarf she hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that her son proudly discovers.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen out and has kept its color.
“I’ve never used shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life I have never gone shopping at a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything returned to its proper course when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds strange in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult that is professed to the father figure of the nation, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when he ceded the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s gray-haired son is right: “in our culture, the elderly are highly respected.”
They live in a big family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this weren't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Protests rivalling each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, with Sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in pathos.
“We need to overcome the transition.
And for that to happen is my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
All of them, so far thrown into a confused opposition, are frightened.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost apologizing, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his own "to save the revolution."
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you want to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour night meeting, are truly troubling.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean by “principles”?
This was and still is open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the scope for legal maneuvering that has been provided, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak’s dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
It is such an inaccurate formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly speaking, this is nothing more than censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits "offension to people"
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been closing ranks in the face of Islamist superiority for weeks.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Cario’s Tahrir Square and vowed to fail the Act before it can go into effect.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” says Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third on the presidential election lists.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be “in the trash bin of history.”
On Twitter, he accused Mursi’s followers of wanting to lead a “coup d’etat against democracy.”
“When I call the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," Egyptian opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted as saying in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration, perhaps not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of Cairo University.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it to the cry: "the people demand the application of the divine law".
They demanded that Mursi “cleanse the country,” while proclaiming: “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi’s supporters did not want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those opposed to the draft constitution and supporters of it would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should go.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced trial during Mubarak’s dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
“And now the expression ‘Human Rights’ doesn’t even appear in the new constitution,” he laments in a conversation with the newspaper “Welt am Sonntag.”
The extension of Morsi’s powers to the three powers of the state caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the most smelly fish in the world?
Norway’s five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country’s success bears any relation to its greed for an extremely smelly fish?
Take a series of overcured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, damp football clothing.
Leave it there for a week.
You will then be able to smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of the delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It is snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is allowed to ferment in water for up to a year, depending on how smelly you prefer it.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating delicacy.
“You eat raw and then drink a glass of aquavit from a drink,” says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the “General of Rakfisk,” who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking from a drink significant amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'll try a few bits.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it’s not bad; it’s not much different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty plagued Norway and in which, before there was refrigeration, the fish was stored during the autumn immersed in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the senses inactive due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of people from Sweden, the old rival and even not much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential, though rather smelly, part of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes that can be purchased.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A cane of beer or a sandwich cost you a whopping 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the July 22 event.”
Norwegians find it very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway’s current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she passes rakfisk trays and with her long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, wise people.”
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn’t have during the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a laughing shred.
I'm in the snow lining up to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is definitely something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, that smelly fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held where diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A television has connected live with a bow tie presenter who is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps beaten by the aquavit.
Or maybe they're the fumes of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico’s incoming President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant discusses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad at the moment.
In a city that, under the best of circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the management of the nation.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
“My administration has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Before joining the U.S. president, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a’s previous political experience was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
A very populated and rapidly growing state, surrounding the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructures.
To get to the city you can drive on one of the new roads of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
Plaques with his name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he can make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, deputy of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto's party, the PRI.
“Particularly when it comes to security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country needs so much.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was overthrown by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, inside the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition’s rating of the new president’s lack of essence.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic statesman and, above all, he’s a person who can listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that’s not the impression a lot of people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated stretches of highway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was asked to intervene to help fight drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto say, at best, that he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
Most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official story, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
“When I arrived at her house, it looked as if her body had been cleaned,” recalls Mrs. Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a.
“There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared.”
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observes from the walls, next to a cross in which one reads a single word: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family says has been denied.
“State authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a complainer.
What they want is for one to simply accept what they say and shut up.”
“But that cannot be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his tenure.
“I hope it’s the same kind of president it was when I was governor,” says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of Bradley Manning abuse during his time in prison
Trial focuses on Manning's time at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's incarceration was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now alleges he suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecution’s pre-trial interrogation of Manning in Ft. Meade, Maryland, U.S. Attorney Commander Ashden Fein said records of weekly visits by officers from the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he was receiving.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defense’s request to dismiss the case because his incarceration had been harsh and it had already meant enough punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In Friday’s hearing, Fein and Manning reviewed the forms that officers filled out after Manning’s visits during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was held in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had rated the treatment given to him by the caretakers as “excellent” and the treatment received at the facility in general as “very professional.”
The forms do not show any allegations of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that visiting officers had spoken about those issues and indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record those issues in the record.
“They wrote ‘no incidents’ (after they had talked about the issues) but that doesn’t necessarily mean I wouldn’t have mentioned any issues,” Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the January 2011 meeting with a board tasked with examining the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was under.
The military said it had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of other people.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was okay and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a military prison at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage,” Manning said Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning claimed that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the caretakers could not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him to turn around again.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he made in Thursday's statement that after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell one night, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of caretakers and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge’s interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the watchman’s order that he should drop the blanket he might have covered himself with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops to self-harm but that he had not.
Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he went through during his time in prison and drastically reduce his sentence in case he was convicted at the war council, which is scheduled to start early next year.
The defense said it plans to make Manning plead guilty to misdemeanors and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules applicable to any detainee in maximum custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If convicted on all charges, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely come down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Posters pointed the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners."
I stood there for a few seconds not sure where I should go.
Growing up in Central California, my whole life I’ve been called “Mexican.”
It’s ethnic shorthand, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as “Irish” or my friends in New York call themselves “Italian.”
I later decided on "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
She was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Good enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary level of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that time this week when Mexico’s President-elect, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, there was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment it is as likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as that he will venture to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them of it are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma are at war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom this is not the case.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Mexico is not.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and they look over our shoulders as if we were from an inferior category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn’t find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still like lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter it bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love to hear the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexican.
Now, to complicate things even more, from what I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised “ambassadors” of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American comrades how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much grudge.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, folks.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated far less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and habitual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything torn apart whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make their struggle even bloodier than before.
However, there is reason to think that his lethal deadlock situation could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism currently seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 is maintained, this week’s clashes have bolstered the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on Gaza’s 1.7 million people in one of the world’s most miserable and populous corners, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a reborn regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Exulting Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia-party dominates, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood are Hamas’s cousins and its leaders rely more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is more steadfast than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the latest wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that erodes the West Bank, the main piece of aspiring territory to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite being illegal under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why pamper these twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets the way their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will prevail, although the Arab spring could alter their calculations.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the area’s superpower will hardly help new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, in the same way a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two to three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one that is preached by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin curbing the entry of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the impending attempt to obtain a virtual status category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision for the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic Tobacco Packaging Law Comes into Force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and diseased body parts appear on green off-label packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia’s world-leading tobacco and generic packaging law comes into force and replaces brand logos and colors with an olive-green wrapper, frightening images of diseased body parts and depictions of sick children and babies as children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all printed on a small type of font.
It is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The federal government of Australia claims that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamourous.
He trusts studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before age 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never do so.
“You can see that children, even from an early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say their business has benefited from the law’s passage.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-run company, said the demand for silicone bins and covers to cover the nasty images on the bins had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in Australia's Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha said Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale outlets and was expecting more stock.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
“If you market tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in brand reviews from “walking citizens” posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble to make a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
Australia’s British American Tobacco said the industry is more focused on what the new regulation entails than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are claiming before the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering enforcing similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the mandatory requirement to include images on its packaging.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are defiant.
“The pictures don’t affect me.
I just don’t listen to them.”
“You take the cigar and keep the package,” says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack stall in central Sydney, says the uniform boxes make it harder for him to put them on the shelves.
“It usually took an hour to unravel a delivery; now it takes four,” Yu says.
“The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, that’s it, that’s it, that’s it, that’s it, that’s it and we closed the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not that bad to get a little bored
During this year’s Thanksgiving party, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention duty-free shops.
But more and more academics and child development experts are praising the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it’s okay for both us and our children to get bored from time to time.
Boredom forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we don’t experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in good spirits?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
But, we will talk about it later.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of the book Boredom: A Lively History, published in 2011 by Yale University Press, says, it is not so.
“In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating from the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining published research and pitching the idea to a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “desiring, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you.”
He states that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the disruption of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly."
Boredom can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that while they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be their own.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a journal article.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to a full-length television program that was unrelated, others listened to it at low volume, so that it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it was difficult for them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, altering attention can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like detecting faulty parts in a manufacturing line, music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or scribbling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, as they make that person more physically alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a “boredom trend scale.”
The scale includes questions like “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But in general, teens are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know if the current percentages of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that “adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest heights,” largely because both children and teens aren’t given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: Is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as placing bets or falling into substance use as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Boring is the brain’s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he won’t have learned to entertain himself or dose himself,” says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of him either.
Our aim should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant rumour of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to relate to something worthwhile,” she says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a downtime.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Use Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community high school and footballer from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by police.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (minor crimes each carrying a $100 fine) informing him of the trial date.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanors for marijuana possession are being overturned both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s most conservative districts have pledged to move forward with cases opened for marijuana possession and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent recently authorized marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“All of this is changing so quickly that I don’t know what the next thing is going to be,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police at Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the issue around.
And they continue to seek advice on establishing a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licenses, all before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that serves as a model,” he says.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6, which also leaves a year during which you will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to offer “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana and its ban on conducting cannabis businesses within 300 meters of schools, parks, children’s playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be harder to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On November 21, Aurora’s police chief, Oates, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city’s prosecutor would stop prosecuting minor misdemeanors for possession of marijuana by people over the age of 21 and that police would stop bringing charges against those crimes “with immediate effect.”
Police Chief Oates said they would enforce the city’s regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue drug dealers and sellers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers and to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those misdeeds that at the time they occurred were a crime,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Even though 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier to district attorneys,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney representing marijuana possession defendants and a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
“They’ve spent so much time taking people to court that, in reality, they still can’t accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the national test cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales frontier, they also look forward to receiving guidance from the federal government, which still envisages considering the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offenses.
Advocates of marijuana legalization hope the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana vendors for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
“While anti-drug agents are likely not to pull down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, they will likely be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of recreational marijuana, permitted under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will take about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favor of what the community voted for versus voting in favor of what the state voted for.”
A lot of questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I was kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
Students are not attacked for their views just now
I don’t remember any time in my life that I haven’t been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary Greek symposium that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the History career, I had already packed up, triggering the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had quit because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had left because I was forced to drink in peeled cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
You may be wondering what that's coming for now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students is such in Oxford that last week a group of them called for the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's JCR (Grade Student Group) say they are "often seriously sidelined, personally attacked and treated as non-grateful people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their college’s Equal Opportunity Committee to make sure they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics that portrayed the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated like "Turkish heads" by introducing higher tuition rates.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing leftist trend in universities.
People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old Corpus Christi history student who introduced the motion for greater protection, says this environment is “uncomfortable,” while Stephanie Cherill, 19, and elected president of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first weeks at Oxford I was more alone than at one.
I went to college in September 1986, I was an 18-year-old who was terribly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny former student Margaret Thatcher an “honoris causa” degree following cuts in higher education funding.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that not only did the professors turn a blind eye to the mockery of the conservative university students, but they gladly participated in it.
The policy of the miners’ strike, the privatization and the government’s opposition to the apartheid sanctions in South Africa went all the way to the seminary’s wooden halls.
The first time I attended, French texts from the eighteenth century were to be translated into English, and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Not one of them.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake dough, knew how to expel bad bile.
"Are the Thatcherists refusing to learn French, or are they simply fools?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt grunted.
I went back to my room like a soul in pain.
That night I sat alone at dinner time in college; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it'll be even worse.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labour.”
Later, at a local pub, I cowardly tried to cover it up.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted this song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
“They beat each other up, don’t they?”
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you someday lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me only after dark?
Should I become Labour and repress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history assigned to my college.
They hated him for being not only from the Conservative Party, but also Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote him his speeches.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he said.
I began commuting daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my beloved dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude.”
Her sore eyes began to get cloudy.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to make a joke.
It would break my heart if you left it.”
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had hinted, speaking totally seriously, that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had “brainwashed” me and called them “stupid old men.”
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career in Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch’s press.
My door was locked.
I was inside huddled in fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 Prime Ministers of the Conservative Party but, to this day, hides behind a reputation unearned by equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro della Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", an apotheotic retrospective that brings together more than 130 couture dresses created by his "maison" over the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until next March 3rd, private letters and photos with the signature of the most garnet of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England abound.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from the humble dressmaker of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
“At least they don’t quench the buttocks on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved being invited to their chalet in Gstaad,” explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, shining a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the dressmaker.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
There were twenty of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything you could see and feel your spirit.
“Each of the guests made us feel important and loved,” recalls the top model, who began working with him during the Paris Haute Couture Week in 1995.
“It never goes out of fashion because their designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Alcurnia parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-requited loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous walkway sixty meters long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the walkway to contemplate a dreamy "audience" that wears masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Arist<0xC3><0xB3>teles Onassis.
In this audience of mannequins shine names such as Sibyl of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Dressmaker, 2006
Many of those customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember him perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love of women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergcannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of becoming the age and the opportunity to wear one of his night suits...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a flowing skirt, draped "corsage" and word of honor neckline.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dresses from the dressmaker with "the utmost care ... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that entails".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is the wedding costume of Marie-Chantal Miller at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the dressmaker calls his seamstresses) to make that ivory silk suit with inlaid pearls, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone of haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return of the clients of high society".
Obsessed for years with the savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre of the elite, Valentino is now their best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani amassed as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
“I’ve always been struck by his refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance,” D’Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
“He was impeccable, time doesn’t pass for him.”
If a princess says so...
The World's Toughest Craft: Kawah Ijen's Human Mules
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the innards of the Earth solidifies when it comes into contact with air.
After plucking large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets that he carries on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
They are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend at turtle pace, keeping the balance and temptingly measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the cliff.
They know that any trip could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who broke down years ago because of the risks of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine
Once upstairs, they make their way among the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, tiringly carrying the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euros) for every kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
“As is normal to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” explains Anto, who usually carries three times a day.
It takes three hours in each and ends up ground, but they allow you to raise 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn on the field.
"The miners' pay is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)", clarifies the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the tago was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town close to the volcano, for a weighty reason that, in Indonesia, is as blunt as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and is irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing with his skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already started to take a toll on him despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
You have asthma, have difficulty breathing, cough constantly, and are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
It’s the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this sympathetic and intelligent young man might be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater and lights up with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he has bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its small profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and at both weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) camera surcharge that, together with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for the beasts and not for the people,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old porter who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, she says she will endure working "as much as she can" because she needs the money to educate her three children, aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulphur burns the throat and darkens the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases ... beyond, of course, their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, knee pains and shoulder sores, which have been malformed by the weight.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions pluck 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat path through the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth wide, where he is missing several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest trades in the world: that of the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let us do our civic duty and believe life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that — or perhaps because of that — the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bao (cake) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hopeful that with the ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do “their national duty.”
This is purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world at reproducing ourselves, so we felt this was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do as creatively as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who does not take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore’s birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 — known as the replenishment rate — was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, says it is due to “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in singleness, and to delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, whom they criticize for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone on to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have areas of 46 square meters and have had a lot of sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family-friendly homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who were previously put on hold if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules may be a step toward raising the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district doesn’t seem like they’re going to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
The private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ola it is about the quality of private or "the field of private life that one has the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child under 16?
How does this definition apply to your daily life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by venting online situations that you would surely not share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15 who were frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on a personal level, and “in the user’s key and name,” when they applied it to social media.
“My deepest secrets wouldn’t be uploaded to a post,” says Jorge, ten, as he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“They’re very secret secrets, my mom may know them, but not everyone,” she says.
On FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a picture that isn’t mine, or someone making a fool of themselves,” he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene, nude, crime photographs or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know his 35 friends on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just pick them up,” he adds.
“Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” she says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to anyone recommending him to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, none have been hinted at or asked for his home address or phone number.
“If they pressured me or demanded it, I would simply take them out of my account,” he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who he was,” he says.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close the account.
"He just gave her privacy."
Then it explains a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I feel bad or if I feel like it.
“Although I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, it should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of seeking information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed," he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master’s degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite criterion on what is or is not appropriate to disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that."
“Also be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t help,” he adds.
Below, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you label party photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, does everyone need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do off line.
It's the same rules.
“One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be on social media,” he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential for parents to read social media policies consciously.
By understanding each of the incisions they have a solid foundation for conversing with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it’s key to remind children of the lesson of “don’t talk to strangers.”
UNASUR Summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending presidents.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency initially indicated that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but later said that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the UNASUR governments attending the event, although not the Peruvian one.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but this is Humala’s pronouncement, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that transmission systems were insured for all journalists, but limited the collection of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that directs a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to listen to the arguments of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will finish and execute the sentence that defines the differences we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, greeting Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international tribunal, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely erroneous.
The summit was held with the absentees of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the ouster of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $ 17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residency".
He said that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, cheap internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transversal axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for his reinstatement to the Union of South American Nations,” from which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace and good relations among neighbours was another issue underlined by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan partner, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in a respectful way the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
“Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We will review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,” he said.
"With President Ortega, I hope to be able to tell him to handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega would meet Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the Peruvian state TV that Europeans “were killed in World War II” and other conflicts, “but now they are practically a homeland.”
He defended, in this sense, the project of establishing the South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers by any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose pact on human rights.
Those who give the chair never commit themselves to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum given to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret that decision because it did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep democratic and human rights values."
He added that, at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was being extradited to a third country and his process was not respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish court for demanding that he be interrogated in his territory for an alleged sex crime when "Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there is a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health will deteriorate.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he’s been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” he said.
What does exist is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked up in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“That complicates the health of anyone,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a safe-conduct allowing him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word we do not use in this case, but there have been permanent talks.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzon, is doing a series of proceedings in different European instances,” he said.
“If Britain gives the safe-conduct tomorrow, it’s over.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and nuanced that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression".
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and evil politicians but the bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that it is no longer these journalists “neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador”, and said that if he is re-elected “he will deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto against Paraguay in the UNASUR at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and legalized coup" because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
This ruling is not being complied with at the moment.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed broadly to overcome them and move forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the litigation for maritime limits that maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and opined that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit themselves to accept judgment no matter how hard it is".
Referring to the possibility that he will run as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said that he sees that possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador’s, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
Winning would be my last term in the presidency and from there we left public life.
If we lose the same.
“It’s a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s new health treatment in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It doesn’t mean a relapse in President Chavez’s state of health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Deaths from AIDS today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: AIDS positive.
"It was as if I dropped a bomb," he refers to recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to make "smoother little," without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; with such an effort that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was bringing a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, still many people arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, noting that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affecting the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years CD4.
In simple words, this means that those who are diagnosed with HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as you remain in control you will be able to live without problems until you are 75 years old," explained the interviewee.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths as of May this year; however, it is claimed that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medication the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who require it.”
In his proposal agree specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who came to be tested in a private laboratory, only motivated because he had done it a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi’s sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die already, I’d better pop three times a week,” they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take medications.
To date, her parents only know that she suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
“I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I share responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with Millenio Jalisco to motivate with his testimony those who today, as part of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
That they get tested, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the battle motto for AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapat<0xC3><0xAD>o journalist who has taken on the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that's fine, but it turns out that there are those today, still, who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with sorcery and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, said the communicator.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms be not just behind the counters and that those hundred be found in public restroom dispatchers of places frequented by young people.
It’s not about motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez replied, when he asked if there would be distribution of condoms in his Administration.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks 4th in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for one registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court on a ruling that ignores the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt achieved through a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a nefarious precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the procedures downstream of the survival of the signatures that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars, against the backdrop of international conventions.
In practical terms, the endorsement of the sentence issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms helpless in the face of the possibility of embargo of their properties in El Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door for Mexico’s leading glassmaker to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
Initially, while the judge in the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says the main proceeding is the mercantile tender process in Mexico.
The first point would involve disregarding international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
To this end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial tender, the debts that Vitro’s subsidiaries had with their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro that fought against it in the United States Courts, that is to say the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
This is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation that he faced from 2008 onwards, as a result of the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, hitting the country with the pigtails.
Soon, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family’s signature will bring an appeal for reconsideration before the appeals court itself so that the vote will reach the full court, i.e. the five judges, since only three of them voted.
Failure to do so will result in Cerciorare’s appeal requiring a review of the case by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the Law on Commercial Competitions, noting that it was released with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensure fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General Balance
Sleeping for several months the complaints placed on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n against the former owner of the company, Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Trade Union Association of Pilots Aviadores has already found the bottleneck.
The court headed by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n, 198 million pesos.
The funds would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Searching for Dragon Mart
Meeting over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a housing area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental thing that destroyed part of protected areas and raises the mother of all the hoaxes against the industry.
The ACTA died.
A Senate request to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property has already passed to the file.
As you know, the action came despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of basketball and, thanks to him, he traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as broad as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was a minor category player, a player of the National Superior Basketball, an agent and leader in the BSN with the Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I’ve put on a lot of hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 90s,” Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Kings does not exaggerate by making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive trajectory, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
Of all, the ones he treasures with the greatest emotion are those that recall his time for the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years serving as co-owner or proxy of the franchise.
Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as a proxy, co-powered or manager.
They were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at BSN.
From then on "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a very strong player, 6"7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our top shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another one.
The championship of the Cowboys with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, because by 1988 it was already the most federative command.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy on the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Pre-Olympic Games in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came in fourth place and it should have been bronze if it wasn’t for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that group from the 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a peel to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won us the bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter young, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90 due to an injury in the knee.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the mess of the Panamericano de Mar del Plata, we won gold against all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt that was Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as Piculin did.
And that’s without counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Boricua leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, that the Ponce boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the result of compulsory certifications and courses for leaders, table officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producer of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he liked the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him so much.
“He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, he was found to have a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he encounters an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his house.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars in risky bookmakers.
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it in and made "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment show in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), interned.
“I know what I want on J.R.’s gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone “huge, on and off the screen.”
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, that we were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already finished recording five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was in the process, the network reported.
There was immediately no word from Warner or TNT about how the series will handle Hagman’s loss.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything in there that I thought would hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant he became a promoter of organ donation and volunteered in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I value them, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, such as "do not be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you will be fine."
She was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
They start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the “long countdown” of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clung as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called “deduarmaged” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University this week.
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World.”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what’s possible, probable, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled “The End of the World” only.
“We don’t add ‘2012’ to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin,” students must study, generate projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the same night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“It was saturated in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, N.J., in Rutgers-Camden.
The apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a professor — said he believed in the expiration date of December 21.
“Our first project was about Maya prophecy and in a way we disbelieved it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old West Chester senior at Temple.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he pointed out that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
“Otherwise people don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knew about any course on the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to parties "at the end of the world".
“Maybe I’ll call some friends to laugh together,” said 20-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
