I don't drink alcohol.
Looks like there's no way out.
We fell asleep.

Why should we help you?
I put the plan into practice.
He made a list.
For a while I was really addicted to Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.

We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember that.
Tom said he likes to teach French.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you'd mistake him for a Frenchman.
It came ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was short.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for only $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!

No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
She's depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you Mary's husband?

What do you think of the new teacher?
If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen more powerful than the sword?
You bought a tea service.
We're all gonna die.
Tom continued to cry.
I can't do that yet.
George was out of his mind!
You have misled me.

I forgot everything about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm messy.

Tom tried to ignore Mary.
I got home late last night.
We ran out of gas in the middle of the desert.
Don't worry, I'll be home safe and sound.

Are you learning French?
Is that your son?
Tom never asked why.
He was often up late.
I don't eat bananas often.
Get them out of here.

Take care of them.
I live in Fiji.
Do you want to eat with us?

I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his income on drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.

I came to see you.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?

He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry up.
Tom hated them.
I get sick almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer evening.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for the car keys.
I really don't want to talk.
So it must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I suggest you be more cautious.
She's shaken.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.

Keep your tongue at bay.

Drink the medicine.
I can see a pattern.
He was unable to attend the party.
Do you still collect stamps?
It's not for them.
They're both good.
He spilled his drink on my tuxedo.
Why don't you wear that hat anymore?
The report soon became known throughout the country.
I love your daughter.
Are you as bored as I am?
Mary kissed her father on the cheek.
What kind of beer do you have?
We are used to living in a big city.
They are our dearest friends.
In general, Japan’s climate is mild.
I had three exams today.
I had no idea she was coming.
I'm sorry, but I'm not paid enough to worry.
Where do you keep your bottle opener?
Don't you understand yet?
Can you teach me how to play chess?
What time should I wake you?
There's no one here.
You should apologize to them.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Layla wondered where Sami was.
Take Tom out.
I was happy at the time.
I told him I wasn't hungry.
Tom's messy, isn't he?
They said they were embarrassed.
Please, take them.
Please, come home.
I like professional wrestling.
Tom is clever.
Don't be so formal, please!
You think that's a clue?
I don't think Tom's jokes are particularly funny.
He does everything very quickly.
Please don't kill me!
I bit my lip.
You're a moralist.
She's always been a hothead.
She likes beans.
I'm having trouble falling asleep.
The relief is instantaneous.
Lida is a close friend of Mary.
Please don't interrupt me while I'm talking.
I hope to participate.
I never lied to her.
She ate an apple.
Do not judge people by appearance.
She's jealous.
Okay, right, I understand what you mean.
You'll be safe here.
Are you proud of your father?
Tom's snotty.
You have already been to Berlin.
You are too young to be in love.
Stay awake.
Where did Tom put my passport?
Now lie down.
He finally decided to get married.
Can I use your phone?
Can't we do anything?
The "A loves B" report is not reflective, transitive or symmetrical.
Add more salt to the soup.
You just have to sweep the floor.
Don’t give a child more money than necessary.
Tom thinks Mary lied.
I won't talk about it.
I'm a fucking economist.
Tom wouldn't understand.
You want something to drink?
I'm here to help you.
He was too drunk to drive home.
I heard voices.
I respected Tom.
So what happened next?
She's ready now.
Go play with him.
Now go brush your teeth.
I can't fire them.
He had a shot of anger.
Don’t make any noise while eating the soup.
Please go to the supermarket and buy some fruit.
I realized I wasn't ready.
Mr. White went to Canada.
You think Tom's funny?
She's not sure she's coming back to her husband's house.
I'll give it a heap right away.
He said he wasn't interested.
What does the note say?
I don't have to be accountable to her for my actions.
Mr. Gomez didn't apologize for my mistake.
Is he a foreigner?
I think you're perfect.
Let's send them all home.
The thermometer marks three degrees below zero.
Even though Marcel works hard, he only earns 30,000 Canadian dollars a year.
Where did you get them?
Can you give me one euro?
Tom was the only one who wasn't eating.
I don't want to do anything against the law.
Evaluate your progress.
How many trips do these buses have every hour?
She wasn't a very good pianist.
Do you have cats?
Women like men with moustache.
He fell from the tree.
He will contribute to this project.
The tree is sick.
Tom will probably be bored.
It was a good choice.
The frost caused a lot of damage to the crops.
Tom deserves an explanation.
Try to think about it.
Are you ready to study Klingon?
Who wrote "The Prince"?
I'll pretend this never happened.
Sometimes a little pride is what we need.
Tom lost his money, his family and his friends.
He lives here completely alone.
He convinced me.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
You kissed him, didn't you?
Why isn't Tom here today?
That should be interesting.
He moved west to Nashville, Tennessee.
I'll call you back later.
Where do you want to go?
Tom knows exactly how Mary feels.
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
Didn't Tom tell you?
He misled me.
Can rabbits swim?
Sami was trying to learn Arabic.
You've gotten taller.
Call my wife.
They'll understand.
He read an article.
She couldn't come because of her illness.
Sometimes he's late for school.
My son is brushing his teeth.
I have always loved this restaurant.
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.
Dogs are territorial.
Tom's playing in the park.
Can someone open the door, please?
I was just doing my duty.
I want to ask them when is their big day.
Feed the bird.
You know I love Tom, right?
I can't give Mary anything she wants.
He's coming at noon.
You're a busy person, aren't you?
Tom asked everyone to leave.
I'm very frustrated.
She cried when she heard the terrible news.
I'm afraid it's too late to say no.
You're important.
He convinced his wife not to divorce him.
My answer matches yours.
There is no life without electricity and water.
I'm right.
They won't see me without a date.
She drove her boyfriend out of the house.
Have you ever written a letter to Mary?
He behaves very timidly in his presence.
Tom is spoiled.
It's probably a mistake.
He is a famous painter and should be treated as such.
Our cities create serious pollution problems.
Tom has a job.
How dare you talk to me like that!
Tell him to go.
I absolutely love autumn.
Tom is suspicious.
The good news is that we will be able to help you.
I usually take a bath before going to bed.
What I want is a word processor.
What brought you to Boston?
Do I bother you sometimes?
You want me to leave now?
We are outraged.
I hope you had a great day!
I'm feeling stressed.
Mary laughed.
We all wanted revenge.
Tom will never agree.
I'm diligent.
I'm sure they're talking about us.
I'm lucky today.
It looks like a baboon.
"Do you have a dog?" "No."
He has a strange character.
Have faith in God.
Promise me you'll help them.
I wonder why Tom's not here.
Many people thought he was too young to be president.
Tom wondered if Mary could speak French.
Our train arrived late.
Why is Tom looking at me?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
How's Tom when he's angry?
He's so lazy.
Help Tom study.
Do you like to travel?
Do you like Tom?
I don't want to be afraid of Tom anymore.
What keeps you up so late?
You don't have a wife, do you?
It was sudden.
Just use mine for now.
He risked his life to save her.
We can't be friends anymore.
He didn't give me anything.
Your father was right.
Tom is very generous.
You let Tom kiss you?
How old could your grandfather be?
They are too indebted to get the loan for small businesses.
Do you have oranges?
Looks like Tom's annoyed.
I know you spent the last three years in prison.
That's the norm.
The office is deserted.
He sleeps a lot.
Don't hold it backwards.
We must preserve our peaceful constitution.
This is a man dressed as a woman.
Tom is impassive.
Could you call him?
You would be surprised at what you can learn in a week.
Tom has a house with two rooms.
Don't say stupid things!
Give them the keys.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
It's already good.
I think Tom is flexible.
We'll wait for Tom in the lobby.
I've ridiculed myself.
It was dangerous.
She was happy with the new dress.
You see this?
Tom has no empathy.
Is Tom busy?
He could die.
It depends too much on him.
Tom's nice to me.
It won't happen.
Tom is home, but Mary is not.
And forget about him.
You're different.
I wasn't angry.
Tom's dead.
I know you hate school.
My late wife's daughters signed up for Facebook.
Sami called Layla for her birthday.
I was very annoyed by him for being so late.
The princess is wearing a gold diadem.
You're still shocked, aren't you?
He's a little jealous.
It weighs more than eighty kilos.
You don't drive for fear of an accident.
Send him that paper.
A couple of red sticks broke.
The train arrived in London.
Do your colleagues like their work?
Where do you think we are?
Thirteen Americans were killed.
I was disfigured.
I have been in frequent contact with foreign students.
I have a very pretty girlfriend.
I can't see him anymore.
It's unpredictable.
This underwater watch is a little too expensive.
The torch does not light at the base.
Put your books away.
His days are numbered.
Tom does what he wants.
The river flooded the entire region.
You'd better fight sleep.
It really sucks.
I have to go help her.
Sami waited.
I forgot his address.
Were you in love with them?
Hey, did you hear that?
Tom went to France two months ago.
I'm pretty weak right now.
Tom couldn't control himself.
You never trust Tom.
I don't look like Tom at all.
Our work never ends.
You know Tom likes Mary.
Why was it so slow?
We have seen three wars.
The flowers bloom.
Let's go find them.
Are you studying French?
In 1900 he left England and never returned.
Tom's saving money for college.
The city was abandoned by its inhabitants.
Tom is rich and powerful.
He can't be more than 20.
Have you read any of Agatha Christie’s books?
It deserves a promotion.
I want you to stay where you are.

He is the fifth man in line.
I hate watching TV.
Iran is planning to send a monkey into space.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
You didn't listen.
You convinced me.
Layla left Sami.
Are you capable of beating a car?
Tom's not my defaulter, he's just a friend.
Tom never apologized for what he did to us.
What method did you use to quit smoking?
The Morales are in the room.
We went to the beach.
I think they'll be late.
Tom is annoyed.
You shouldn't listen to me.
It doesn't change anything.
You don't have to change.
Oh, look, they're kissing!
I wish he had attended the conference.
Tom was taken to the emergency room.
I have a question for you.
Tom called at half past two.
I live in Osaka.
I'm a doctor, Jim, not a lawyer.
I'm keeping this place for you.
Tom didn't know who Mary was.
I'm not gonna find a delinquent.
Today the weather is beautiful.
It didn't matter to anyone.
You're from Urumqi?
Let me take you to the hospital.
We love what we do.
Together everything is possible!
I want you to be better.
He didn't come back.
You'd better go help them.
He ordered him not to give orders.
I think Tom's in trouble.
I'd like you to accompany him.
Were you in Cairo?
She's got to be out.
I'm not worried about you.
What do you want to do for work?
We want to meet him.
Do you like songs?
Do you really think Tom is honest?
I'm getting married soon.
They added a woman to the committee.
Tom didn't scare me.
I'm working here.
He can't swim.
You can talk to me, you know?
Are you always busy?
Did he tell you what to do?
Don't fuck with her!
How long have you lived in Kobe?
How much do you like your new job?
Tom marinated the school.
It wasn't so cold yesterday.
I really like Tom.
Tom threw up in the bucket.
Sami doesn't celebrate Halloween.
You'll never see them again.
I tried to contact him.
He made room for an elderly woman on the bus.
What are you doing here?
It's a delicate problem.
I went to see a movie with Tom after work.
There will always be.
I'm trying to avoid them.
No one can understand it.
I'm getting weak!
You're pretty overweight, aren't you?
I never believed him.
I am no longer his angel.
Tom probably won't be shy.
He knows how to recite poetry.
She closed a door.
I don't want Tom to do it here.
I'm in Rome.
Tom gave Mary a Christmas present.
I can tell you're angry.
She passed away yesterday afternoon.
Were you blindfolded?
We're being helped.
This guy tried to kill me.
We arrived in New York at night.
Why did Tom kiss Mary?
Come on, don't be silly.
It's a little late for that, don't you think?
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Everyone knew you.
Why did you sign the confession?
I know Tom's guilty.
You have only two options.
You seem surprised.
I'll ask around.
I don't remember anything.
Tom speaks French perfectly.
He bought bread.
Tom started working immediately.
Do you like this flower?
Do you know Mr. Jackson?
I didn't have to stay.
Tom's trying to fix his car.
You think Tom's still up?
Why are you giving Tom money?
It might be better.
He really hates this way of thinking.
Do not associate with them.
I speak French.
Here's an even better idea.
We're all done here.
At the moment, I don't have a plan.
She calls him often.
She's a musicologist.
Why are you giving Tom money?
Kids know that too.
Mary prepared breakfast for her husband.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
We should have tried harder.
Which one is yours?
I just changed my mind.
I said I was hungry.
I haven't read any of those books.
Liisa was tired of the noise.
Tom was in the garden.
It's permalous, isn't it?
Do you wear glasses?
Are you sure Tom won't be angry?
Tom's gonna call the cops.
Please fill your forehead.
Tom forgot his umbrella again.
Do you have a cell phone?
It seems to me that he is honest.
Don't turn off the light.
They still live with their parents.
Who doesn't like that?
They used the serum of truth.
You're allowed to do that.
I didn't know what to say.
I'm feeling really good.
Give me some.
This is Tony.
He's rich, but he's disgusting.
Read the book out loud.
I think I'll go get them.
Where did you trade them?
I asked Tom and Mary for their keys.
He said he'd call me.
He never had a screwdriver in his hand.
I managed to save them.
You think Tom's guilty?
Why would we want to punish you?
We are not disappointed.
Your handwriting is illegible.
Do you like Tom's tattoos?
Do you have any books on Armenia?
He's as busy as ever.
He called his lawyer.
Are you drunk?
Tom looked astonished.
I'm tired of singing.
Tom won't buy a new car.
Do you love her?
Tell her we're busy.
Is Tom around?
I need to talk to him now.
I can't see them.
No one's gonna know.
Do you want to do business or not?
He asked for a beer.
