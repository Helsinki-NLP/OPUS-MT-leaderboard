Members of the Welsh National Assembly are concerned that they may give the impression that they are "puppets"
Several members of the Welsh National Assembly are appalled that they have been suggested to change their title to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party in the Welsh National Assembly is concerned that he is “rhyming with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuse" and "pwp" means "faeces".
A member of the Welsh National Assembly said the group as a whole was "not pleased" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said the group has an "open" attitude towards changing its name, but also noted that "MWP" resembles "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as is the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the "Parliament of Wales".
With regard to the title of the members of the Welsh National Assembly, the Commission preferred "Welsh Members of Parliament" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option received the most votes in the public consultation.
It appears that members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but trying to reach consensus could give a headache to Elin Jones, chairman of the steering committee, who is expected to submit the bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly shall have the final say in their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on changing their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized to settle a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens government has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is just a compromise that will allow it to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin’s Episcopal Church have stopped beating as a result of the problems facing Harlem churches.
“Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before you found a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there are no more bars or churches.”
He also said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently today,” he said.
“Bars no longer serve as a living room for the entire neighborhood, where people usually gather.”
And with regard to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than leaders expected and that, “sooner or later, the outcome will be the same.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who would not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “therefore this will accelerate the closure of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of the respective churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-Americans – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist congregation, made up of white people, moved from the area after 1930.
A congregation of African-Americans, who carried out their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin’s Church was taken over by a congregation of African-Americans, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting African-Americans.
A fire that occurred in 1939 greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in them.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, called the carillon "poor people's bells."
The expert who commissioned the carillon in July described it differently: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical tool”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said it was the first carillon in the world performed by an African-American musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What was heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought in by church deacons, others by episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the parish’s governing body of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese would “seek to pass on the costs” to the sacristy, even though it was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained about the lack of transparency shown by the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy trying to catch lobsters in California.
Authorities said on Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he swam trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a little boy screaming for help and then moved with a group that helped him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought the boy was thrilled to catch a lobster, but then realized he was shouting, "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The entire collarbone was torn, Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
“I shouted to everyone in the water and told them to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that poses a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper part of the torso.
authorities have restricted access from Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons .
Giles also noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Retailer Sainsbury plans to strengthen its position in the UK beauty and fashion market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing districts with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn consolidation in the UK beauty market, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion sales are not on par, larger districts with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be integrated into more stores over the next year if proven successful.
The investment in the beauty industry comes in the context of supermarkets looking for a way to use the space previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Retailer Sainsbury said the number of beauty products it offers will be doubled to as many as 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space, with marked areas similar to those in Boots stores.
Also, the supermarket is relaunching its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most of the products are aimed at vegans, a demand increasingly common among young buyers.
In addition, the products of French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two Sainsbury chain stores for testing purposes, the first being opened last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of retailer Sainsbury, said outlets will look more and more like universal stores as supermarket chains try to cope with the fight with big discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury has included both products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores, and Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means it has seen increases in food sales, as well as increased profit.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty compartments has failed.
Sainsbury attempted to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ceased after a divergence over how to split the revenues of Boots stores into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury sold his 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury, said: “We have transformed the look of our districts with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to give you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Is Angry After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Contract
“Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle deal with his company to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old “This Morning” host announced on Instagram that she would be retiring.
Holly Willoughby sparked the fury of Peter Jones, the star of the “Dragons’ Den” show, retiring at the last minute from their lifestyle services business to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when one of the most beloved people on television admitted Tuesday, during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, no longer allow her to dedicate herself to their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and accessories.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's fortune, worth an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would give up his contract for Truly, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It would be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to retire shocked everyone.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, there was a little bit more to go before the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe the pullout of “This Morning,” one of Britain’s best-selling stars, could damage the company millions as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible further delay of the launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as director in March.
The couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very rude, and then "we fell in love"
He joked about critics he would receive from journalists for making a comment that some would consider “presidentless” and about having such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
He said Trump imitated a “news anchor” voice.
“I didn’t take a step back.”
He said Kim is interested in having another meeting after the initial June meeting in Singapore was described by Trump as a huge step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have ceased.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not noticed a “proper response” from the United States regarding North Korea’s previous disarmament efforts.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on it.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
“Everything is going well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were headed for a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: the cessation of missile tests, support for the release of hostages, and the return of U.S. military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to behave like a president, but if I were to behave like that, instead of the 10,000 people out there trying to get into this little arena, it would be about 200 people,” Trump said.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, a necessary condition for triggering relief actions at the international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the “Save the Children” foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the agency's national disaster spokesman, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to relief efforts.
Given the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly undergoing, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be insufficiently prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not found very often on other coasts.
It appears that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued in this regard, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under the best of circumstances, travel between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate this.
A hospital ship that has been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo has proposed that improving Indonesia’s precarious infrastructure be the focus of his election campaign and has allocated a lot of money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected the administration of Joko, who will participate next year in a new election campaign.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from Indonesian sectarians as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as bands of Christians and Muslims clashed on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool gives the saving goal and equalizes the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge football stadium.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 metres from the opponent's goal, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before kicking in the direction of the goal.
The ball reached above the box, heading towards the top right corner of the gate.
Finally, the ball passed Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and fell into the goal.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to advance as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn’t think much about it, I just took the ball further.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue forward sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, then went back in the middle of the field and ran to Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who entered the box.
Hazard overtook the defense and sent the ball into the net, managing to hit it with his left foot and pass Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will have a match against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832.
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, on Sunday morning.
Several people were trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday that triggered waves of up to 6 meters, the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000 people, was covered by the debris caused by the collapse of the buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man who was suspected of stabbing a woman.
An investigation into the murder was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything related to the matter to come to the station for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to all people who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who have heard or seen anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful materials with the onboard camera to contact us if they have information essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a woman in Birkenhead and was found on a property.
This afternoon, several people came to the crime scene who believe they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are trying to inform the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building were told it would take several hours before they were allowed in.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene, a woman appeared in tears.
He kept repeating, “It’s so terrible!”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the perimeter and another was outside it.
A few police officers stood in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the latest memorial to be affected by altercations over "rewriting history"
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor Thomas of the previous century.
Cromwell’s magnificent depiction, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than he is today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Regardless of whether it is an accurate representation, this is the subject of continuous historical debate.
But surely the conflict of the mid-17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, who represents a part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
A pig killed a farmer in China.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead after an artery was severed and covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the Morning Post's Sunday editorial in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines to pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly came with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a neighboring cottage was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
Forensics confirmed that a pig weighing about 300 kg caused the death of the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were full of blood and torn apart,” the cousin, whose surname is “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and drive the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that blood taste can trigger such reactions.
“It’s just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them due respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is losing intensity as it moves to cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa records wind conditions with a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression zone has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push intense tropical moisture from the north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation of up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that will interact with the depression zone will generate heavy rains in the southwest in the coming days.
Local rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and possibly landslides into the desert.
Intense tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of between 5 and 10 cm is expected in the southwestern part, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rain could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds in gusts and dust.
The approaching depression zone will bring torrential rain to areas off the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of almost 2 cm is possible, which could result in minor waste streams and slippery roads.
These will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona in the second part of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spreads further on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Intense rainfall will spread to the so-called “four corners” on Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense temperature changes in the US as the Arctic region becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, there are dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to face a warm early October with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in large areas, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high chances of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the press statement supported by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, with TV stations interrupting Friday’s normal schedule for a breaking news story: an agreement between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the court that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh harassed her while he was drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said he is 100% sure this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from the office.
To put this into perspective, this audience is similar to that for a play-off football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
ABC came in second with a viewership of 3.26 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS was watched by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters shouted at him and he tried to climb into an elevator at a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stared down for a few minutes as people scolded him, and everything was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling us the truth?
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Television later broadcast live voting in the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for Senate voting.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to consider the charges against the nominee next week, which the minority democracies demanded.
Flake was largely persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter.
Flake's election was an important one, and it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK prime minister accuses critics of 'political games' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside his front-page photo, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on her Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect each other's tariffs was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for a second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released footage of the Sims and Simpson confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the brawl.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, police say he admitted to killing Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Bureau of Forensic Medicine released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the death was caused by a shot to the head through the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana police force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for the assistance provided in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This worries me all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano tossed an ash column over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater started and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors more howling and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano that lies 72 km southeast of the capital, after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Fight between Catalan separatists and police ahead of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with gendarmes on the first anniversary of the Catalan secession vote, gathering thousands of opposition demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away from gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The fighting intensified later, with the police using their sticks to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” while Union protesters shouted “Long live Spain!”
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to become independent, although voter turnout was low, and anti-secession voters largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, following violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“Last year I had some of the best moments of my life.
I watched my parents cry with joy that I could vote, but now we have nothing to do," he said.
Despite a vital but close victory in last December’s regional elections, pro-independence Catalan parties have tried to maintain momentum this year, with many of the most well-known leaders either in exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of police, said politicians on both sides had fueled the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
“As a candidate in the European elections it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Several men arrested after driving into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car broke into a Londonderry home several times.
The incident took place Thursday, at about 7:30 p.m., in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and even the building.
It seems that at one point a crossbow was used against the car.
Menga's shot helped the Livingston team win 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers unanswered, with Steven Gerrard reaching his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard’s team runs out of a Premier League away win this season and faces the Hearts leaders, behind them with eight points next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remains undefeated in the division for up to six games, with Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat as he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chance against cruel visitors
Holt's team should have moved forward long before they scored, and their orientation caused all sorts of trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break in and tried to kick into the goal space, then Alan Lithgow managed to kick wide after slipping in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause visitors problems on free kicks.
And that was how the crucial void came in.
The Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston managed an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to care for Menga, who kicked and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated possession, but faced the host's impenetrable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was no longer greatly disturbed for the rest of the game.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Allan McGregor of the Rangers, and Lithgow took a wide shot from another Livingston player.
The diagonal passes continued to come in which Livingston’s team, but without success, and the two penalty requests – after Halkett slammed Glenn Middleton and after a haystack – were not accepted.
“Phanomenal game” offered by Livingston – review
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their playing style and team have not changed at all since returning to the top, but the credits must be given to Holt for the way he has coached his team since taking it over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren’t very inspired.
Although they have performed well since being led by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The goal passes were unsuccessful, they only managed to catch the opponents' free gate once, and this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
Everything was pink on Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at redressing relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied with issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside of Turkey.
Police invoked security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, mostly Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country with open arms.
The contradictory protests reflect the division of a visitor considered a hero by some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
A cyclist died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died on the spot.
The crash comes just months after another cyclist died in an accident on Childers Street, in which the driver fled from the scene, which is about a mile from where the crash happened on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in the area, the bus route is diverted, and motorcyclists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Fight
Six prison officers were injured in a fight at a high-security men's prison, a prison official said.
On Sunday, a fight broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m., which was ongoing.
Specialized officers were brought in to handle the brawl, in which eight detainees are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “The assistance of the prison’s specialized staff has been requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after being injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding the perpetrators, who will be transferred to the police and may spend a longer period behind bars.”
In HMP Long Lartin are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after he was attacked by an inmate.
And last year, in October, the officers dealing with the disturbances were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are at risk of being flooded due to Hurricane Rosa (dry areas can enjoy the benefits as a result)
A tropical depression rarely occurs in Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwestern desert, posing a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of Monday will cause precipitation.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state at a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an action hurricane at a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including in the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities of between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with total possible quantities of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas, torrential rain will be beneficial, as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least a severe drought, the second-largest category, according to the report.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which still had hurricane power on Sunday morning with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north, at 19 km per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and, therefore, will diminish.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico with tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, posing a high risk of flooding.
"Torrential rains are expected between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can reach up to 25 cm, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north into Mexico like a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and arriving in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States,” said a representative of the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce sudden flooding, which will endanger people’s lives, and bring waste streams into deserts, as well as landslides into mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 04:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The officers asked for the help of citizens who could have material on their mobile phone, respectively, to show up at the police station.
Trump says Kavanaugh faced "displeasure and anger" from Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh faced "the displeasure and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford’s claims about sexually harassing her ten years ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw that day the genius, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation for one of the best legal minds of this generation,” he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president has indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he talks about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but in a way I’m a candidate,” he said.
“For this reason, I express my positive opinion everywhere about the candidates that I consider outstanding.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesia Earthquake, Number Growing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves six meters high hit the beach at dusk, people being swept away by the water and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still seeing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, thus becoming victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami brought with it cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled offshore at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people were forced to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
Photos published by the disaster agency show several destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the aftershocks continued to shake the city on the coast.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday’s powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb of World War II.
Probably the geographical structure of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, has intensified the scale of the tsunami, he added.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300-kilometre coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake's epicentre.
Communications were "completely disrupted, with no information" in Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was harshly criticized for failing to report that a tsunami would hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In social media posts, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting frenzied warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the authorities' rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending aid cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city’s airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in makeshift shelters in the office yard, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Even as relief groups began to launch disaster relief actions, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, material delivery and personnel can only reach the site of a disaster if it is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet.”
After the second night of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and families of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days, with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paraglider pilots.
Other captives at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Given my experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapsed in the community of paragliding sports practitioners, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to competitors from Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in front of his messages only a gray tick appeared, and not two blue steaks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t transmitted,” he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who powered an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to carry more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "run behind employee Brink" and stole a bag of money to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity is asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his stage name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West has changed his stage name to "Ye".
He made the announcement on Saturday on Twitter: "the individual officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he expects to release his new album, Yandhi.
He comes to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled "for emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West previously stated that this word also has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year as she discussed the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m new, it’s about us.
It all started with “Kanye,” which means the one, and came to “Ye,” which is a reflection on our good things, our bad things, our vagueness, and our wholeness.
The album is more of a reflection on who we are as people.”
He is one of several rappers who have chosen to change their stage name.
Sean Combs had numerous stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with hyphen, sometimes without, as well as in large letters.
Mexico’s president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the army to repress the Mexican people.”
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the market on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were ingrained in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and by opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. Should Double Funding for AI
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after more members of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though in the U.S. there is a lack of an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be first in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next AI discovery,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big achievement in AI will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of SinoVentures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the American player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later served as executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated previous technology competitions by U.S. governments, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that puts academic leaders in the throes, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. step up its AI efforts.
“I think we should automatically give PhD students a visa in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued a Development Plan for the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called “AI Next.”
Also, at this time, NSF is investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, there has been no change in U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change country's name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a change that would settle a decade-old dispute with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the neighboring country represents a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposing nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign has cast doubt on voter turnout, possibly not reaching the 50% threshold required to validate the referendum.
The question on the ballot in the referendum will be: “Do you agree to EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?”.
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted into entities such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum in parliament is required.
The state electoral commission said no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of people with voting rights turned out to vote.
“We came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje, the country’s capital.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, as well as their son Dushko, voted for the referendum on changing Macedonia's name, which will allow it to join NATO and join the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and drew chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our foreheads up, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the majority will be in favor of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of joining NATO and the EU,” Zaev said after voting.
He said one result in favor of changing the name would be “confirming our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of citizens with the right to vote will participate in the referendum, under the necessary number of participants.
According to another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote for change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the voter turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took office in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to pass the entire Brighton defence and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass the Brighton defense and on Saturday won Manchester City 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian forward received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He moved very quickly between the three defensive players from Brighton, before reaching the free side of the field.
Then, Aguero found himself surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to pass a defender, and then overtook several opposing players at the edge of Brighton's box.
After that, he took a pass to the left, the ball reaching Sterling.
The English forward sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, managing to avoid Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs," Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City, told reporters.
“I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling is the one who got them the initial advantage for the Azuri in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero obtained a deep-sea pass on Brighton's territory at that stage.
Then he gave a pass on Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane dribbled the ball several times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it in the direction of the gate.
The Azuri attacker hit the ball to the net just before heading off the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc in match against Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the play-offs, there were not many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold an advantage with a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies scored at least one unpredictable spot with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday night, but are still trying to keep their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver alongside the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level from any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these circumstances?”
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the match on Sunday, but according to sources, it is inclined to let Scherzer take the first hit in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening shot of the 34th game, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 misses in 220 and 2/3 games this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The president referred to the Supreme Court’s decision on Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of a Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“All of our efforts are at stake in November.
There are five weeks until one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the big ones, I’m not running, but I’m actually running, that’s why I try very hard to support the good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this awful, radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by using any necessary means, you can see their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, they want to have power and control, and we won’t give it away.”
He also said that the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“And you can see that in the last four days,” he said, describing the Democrats as “angry and evil, naughty and lying.”
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was heavily harassed by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you divulge the document?
What's that?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different point of view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated.
It did not surprise me at all that the Momentum activists in my local party supported the motion of censure as far as I was concerned.
After all, I am just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehement about anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, the motion of censure was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, concerning which neither Jeremy had common views with previous leaders.
The communication for the Labour Party’s Friday meeting in Nottingham East stated that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For much of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evening were like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings today do not take place in this way, and the promise of a “better, gentler” political environment has long been forgotten, if ever respected.
It has become increasingly apparent that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things have started to be like this since Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision on politics started expecting me to change my mindset and agree to some things I would not have agreed with before, including national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there follows a wave of abuses on the desocialization networks that demand my removal from the party, denouncing the central policy, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than my colleagues, because comments about me tend to be political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination shown by my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censure or change of selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible on this issue.
A lot of people have advised me in the last two years to put my head down, not be so vocal anymore, and everything will be fine like that.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the Thatcher government’s negligence led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who most need them, as a local councilor or minister.
I have never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and the issues with which I disagree with the current leadership are unclear.
To the people who supported Friday’s motion, I can only say that, in the context of the country heading towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for the citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise that no threat of elimination from the party or political opportunism will stop me from taking the decisions I consider in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the football team Ayr reaches the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late attempts influenced the final result in some way, there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win today’s highly interactive match in Tennent’s Premiership.
He is now at the top of the rankings, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
In the end, it all came down to their better defense, as well as the fact that they took more of their chances, which helped the host team and pleased coach Peter Murchie.
“We’ve been subjected to several tests throughout our matches so far and we continue to be unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “The credit goes to the Ayr team, they took the chances more than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team by playing in Warriors, allowed Melrose to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of a non-transforming attempt.
Climo scored a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the game, managed to score, and then managed to turn an individual try, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The game was suspended for several minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off the field with a stretcher, and since the game restarted, Ayr was unleashed through the attempt of the player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the backup player pay with an untransformed attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a terrible pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving the Ayr team the edge.
Climo transformed the attempt, as he did again near the restart of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" move and sent the extreme Gregor Henry deep for the host team's fifth try.
"Still Game" star looks set for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the “Still Game” sitcom, seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after learning he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the BBC's beloved show, writing the script and playing alongside his longtime partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, number nine, will be their last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official registry, this is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “developing restaurant industry.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a crane-filled naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
We have to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive – as is the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely at the highest level in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ’s decision on the big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will give a ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of firm talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – facing a controversial fight for next year’s re-election – also has much to gain from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and that too little would change if it did.
The UN body within the Netherlands does not have the power to grant territory that belongs to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ICJ's decision comes just six months after the final pleas were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And not only has Bolivia been unsuccessful, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric weakened any remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most beloved presidents – used the maritime issue as a political backing.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get past the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Take Place If It Can't Trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic action on the nuclear threat after more than three months of meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "unrealistic dream" that continued sanctions and the U.S. objection to the declaration regarding the end of the Korean War would ever make the North's territory give way.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that Pyongyang has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you’re looking for hats to expand your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
Unpractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and fashion designers have sent creations that steal eyes on the podium.
The piece of resistance of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant hat, beige color, with a wide, feather-like boron, into which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons adorned with beads, a sorcerer’s hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and no haute couture fashion.
One of the creations appeared to be a diving equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while another appeared to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue adopting such a clothing style, with oversized clothing items, you are in luck.
Stylists predict a comeback of huge bonnets in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats come back after the appearance of the "La Bomba" hat, the straw hat with a wide boron, seen by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the unpractical hat that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely the beach straw bag, with a size as large as the model in the swimsuit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’s spring-summer 2019 “La Riviera” collection at Paris Fashion Week
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized beach hats and bags in luxury stores next summer because the fashion designer has had such a powerful impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record for academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional test scores, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust people in other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates within independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; also, 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as a subject, are held in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that because of the reasons employers gave for fighting for vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more, language skills are becoming imperative for preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
By having more languages, especially in developing countries, children will be more likely to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn the languages that are considered to be most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be more languages of choice within independent schools, with teachers who specialize in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done (it has to be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play remains to be settled.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for the following week, which include stops in places where the electorate favors him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his chosen Supreme Court nominee is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to bolster support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s West Virginia election rally be held tonight and where can I watch him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. East Coast time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia election rally online via the live video stream below, on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate’s expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week for the FBI to investigate the allegations.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain some ground.
President Trump’s campaign said the role of these five rallies next week is to “energize volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, tonight’s rally could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won the election at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican West Virginia Senate nominee Patrick Morrisey, who is led in polls.
“The fact that the president came to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. Team Shows Determination and Continues to Fight to Maintain Chance for Singles Trials Starting Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it’s possible that Saturday afternoon’s foursome was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever-swinging pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
“They were leading us by six points, now the difference is only four points, so we’re relying on that drop for a bit of motivation,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are still twelve points left in the game.
Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons for encouragement, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and won three out of four points each.
Spieth sent the balls to the green zone with lethal precision, setting an example for his colleagues.
Those festive guttural howls grew louder as the round progressed, especially when he scored a crucial point by which he tied the score in the fourth game, after he and Thomas had been led by two points after the first two holes.
The blow he won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar howl, a howl that makes you believe the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth says.
That’s what’s left of these players.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The odd but adorable couple of Europe have won four out of four matches and it seems they can’t fail.
“Moliwood” was the only pair that didn’t need any more shots on Saturday afternoon, but that’s also true for Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and even for Friday morning’s nine points.
This performance and the way in which their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic public reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would finally carry out a potential victory of the Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both simultaneously, at different holes.
Talks about European glory remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the fourballs, when he paired with Alex Noren.
An additional shot and two doubles at the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a pit so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
On Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The samples of fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and worth following closely due to the interactions between the pairs, the given and undated tips and the way in which a strategy can be changed on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the final day, but this foursome session has also shown that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, something that some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe lead 10-6 on Ryder Cup final day
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant lead after finishing Saturday's fourballs and foursomes games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two wins in front of a reluctant Tiger Woods, which increased their so far score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, trying to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes in the morning fourballs and won the series with a score of 3 to 1.
The U.S. put up more serious resistance to the foursome, where it won two games but was unable to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points out of 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to earn four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair dubbed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points out of four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly backed up to defeat the daunting Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score of 5-4.
Woods, who struggled in both games on Saturday, had occasional flashes of genius, but has so far lost 19 of 29 games to fourballs and foursomes, seven of which were back-to-back defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the one and three in the world, 2-1.
Europe, however, did not have an unobstructed path on this pleasant and cool day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the standard for Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2-1 match against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in the singles, although, because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being in second place two days in a row, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea says there's "no chance" to disarm unilaterally as long as there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extending sanctions would deepen distrust of the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Global Council's annual General Assembly that North Korea had implemented "significant measures to prove its good faith" last year, such as halting nuclear testing and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we don’t see any proper response from the US,” he said.
“If we can’t trust the U.S., we won’t trust our national security capabilities, and in such circumstances, we can’t unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ri resumed North Korea’s familiar objections to Washington’s opposing resistance to a “stagewise” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took step-by-step steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and North Korea's leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress toward a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump offered guarantees on North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has failed to comply with demands to ease the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on the ‘denuclearization first’ option and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even objecting to the ‘declaration of war’,” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion that only people who don’t know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: "If the issue of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even under these conditions, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from that of last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it is inevitable to target US territory with missiles from North Korea after “Malignant President” Trump called Kim a “rocket-man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea last year with “total destruction,” praised Kim for his courage to initiate the disarmament process, but said the work was just beginning and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned period for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the corridors of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not fare well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but only a few hours later North Korea denounced him as making “gangster threats.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
He said Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and that he wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep longer in an attempt to combat the growing “macho” culture that causes them to undergo “all-night” learning sessions, energized with plenty of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that students at the world’s most prestigious university often don’t even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the creator of the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after holding a lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on the ability to learn.
“In the end, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?’
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course may involve a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
“We know we can’t instantly change student behavior.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud to have learned all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient, good quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think the body is hungry, which makes students feel like they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his first year classes at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before enrolling at this fiercely competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students program an alarm to know when it is time to go to bed, as well as for waking time, and to know what are the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's team
The Rangers are suffering from another case of depression on the move because Dolly Menga's hit condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to score their first away win since a 4–1 win in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as coach, putting the Rangers eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership's authoritarian Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and the uninspired Rangers never seemed able to tie.
The Rangers thus fell to sixth place in the standings, while Livingston climbed to third place, behind the Hibernian, by a one-goal difference.
And the Rangers might face other issues as well, as the crooked referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the lawn of the visiting team’s fans.
Gerrard switched eight players from the lot that won easily against Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get a Hearts equal last week and has every reason to be proud of how his well-trained lot suffocated his opponents throughout the game.
Even though the Rangers had superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more efficiently.
He should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first pass propelled Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's defending goal, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
The Rangers have taken control, but have left the impression that they hope more than they trust their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
The Rangers made only two shots to the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Oviedo Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingstone's 34th minute goal did not respect the game's trend, no one can deny that it was worth it, even if only for the effort made.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep centering of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga, who finished with a single shot.
Gerrard acted on the break, when he switched Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this move almost paid off immediately, when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the goals to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to exactly the same type of match he preferred, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting centering after centering.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs's shot, then Lithgow sent the corner kick to the side of the goal.
Rangers reserve Glenn Middleton asked for a penalty towards the end of the game when he hit Jacobs but again Thomson disagreed.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page in our Sunday morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the CONTINUE count...), is the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger meter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as happened in the 1950 film The Bells of San Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as cowboys with improbable inclinations to science:
Man: “What else is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Yes, you hear a lot of bangs!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to ‘Detect’ Harmful Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “detect” harmful cells and destroy them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can “detect” a protein common to many cancers and are then reinjected.
A test vaccine offers promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can “detect” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “determines the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and “teach” them to target cancer cells, also worked to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a diatribe in support of Trump while wearing a MAGA cap after his appearance at SNL.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a wild show in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he plans to run in the 2020 election.
After performing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist unleashed himself in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump?
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a screenplay starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star overwhelmed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the footage of West's diatribe was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take West by storm with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They tried to intimidate me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out wearing this hat.”
I've been assaulted!
They also told me that we got very low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how low I've gotten?", then said, "I'm going to get my Superman cloak, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments drew public outcry at least twice, and members of the SNL team appeared embarrassed, Variety reported; one person on this team told the publication: “In the studio there was a complete silence.”
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for lead singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was endorsed by TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest spirits among us: THANK YOU FOR CHALLENGE."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply “was himself and that’s great.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (buying music or clothing or supporting ‘art’) who I believe embraces and expresses an ideology harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that he is now "the being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in the footsteps of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, former music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Allegation of attempted murder for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defence lawyer is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of The Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO-produced medieval fantasy series The Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old has attacked the macho hero's stereotype, saying that presenting these roles on screen makes boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said it appeared to him that “something had happened wrong” and wondered how the issue of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old co-worker from the Throne Wars, Rose Leslie, has admitted that he is “very determined” to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m very determined to talk about it now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What have we taught men about being adults, given the problem we’re facing now?”
Kit believes television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do young boys learn on TV and on the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because it is clear that something has happened to the young people.”
In the interview, he admitted that he would not be playing in any series based on Thrones Weapon after the series ends next summer, saying that "it's done with the battlefields and the horses."
From November, Kit will play in a new production of Sam Shepard’s True West play, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that ever happened to him due to the series is that he met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife when I made this show, so it assured my family’s future and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played Ygritte, the girlfriend of Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family’s property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in the number of new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly to some areas of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual HIV transmission is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widely considered.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually end up marrying a woman.
Many of the cases of disease transmission come from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaking Republican senators' data, speaks of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that the accusations are made by analysts and websites of “extreme right.”
“Lies, lies and other miserable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked information included the addresses and personal phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated as a Supreme Court judge.
The leak came shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and presented the information to a member of Waters’ team, Hill reported.
“These unfounded allegations are completely false, an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The team member, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie.”
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
They should not question the motive of the accused.
He has to be calm and quiet.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’s reaction to that of Democrats-criticized Judge Kavanaugh, who said he appeared a little too angry during Tuesday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who is running against Waters in the midterm elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
“Importantly, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted “appropriate authorities and legal entities to these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they will be held accountable to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members.”
Johnny English Hits Again: A Stupid Parody of Spy Movies with Rowan Atkinson in the Leading Role
It has become a tradition to look for meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the parody series of action films that has Johnny English as its main character, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will this glamorous satire of how strange we are become the nation’s new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with the eyes staring and rubber face, has been renewed for the second time his license to ruin everything. The name of the character means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the cinematic audience in the non-English speaking countries.
He is, of course, the squeaky secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of the kind that contributed a single note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious countryless man Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind.
This latest adventure of JE also has one or two cute moments.
I liked when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the rotor blades slightly hit his helm.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is rather weak and, strangely, superfluous, especially because "serious" movies, such as those in 007 or Mission Impossible, confidently offer comedic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to appeal more to children than to adults, and to me, Johnny English’s crazy adventures aren’t as inventive and clever as Atkinson’s silent film gags when he plays Bean.
As usual, the premise is always that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret web of spies and revealed the identities of the undercover British agents, to the desperation of the service agent, a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a pompous and under siege prime minister, who is already suffering a serious crisis due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can with her Theresa May-like character, but the script doesn’t give her a chance to shine.
Her secret intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she must activate a reserve agent.
This is the very zevze of Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a school for the upper class, who also gives lessons on how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute stunts, because English runs a school of spies in the style of School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency session, then is reunited with his former partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, in which the talent of Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So, these Batman and Robin creating tangles in Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, facing off against the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of bachelor adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fashionable French restaurant, create chaos when they sneak aboard Volta’s luxury ship, then English triggers anarchy in pure form when he tries to use a set of virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colorful the movie is, it looks like a children’s television production.
Pretty mediocre movie.
As with the other Johnny English films, I can’t stop wondering: Can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role to match his talent?
Labour denies plans for British workers to work four days a week but get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has a radical plan that the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
The party seems to want company bosses to take advantage of possible savings due to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not change.
Sources say the idea would “match” the party’s economic program, which wants to tip the balance in favor of the workers.
The shift to the four-day work week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party leadership told The Sunday Times: “Announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a fitting aspiration in the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall strategy on industry.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party’s promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party."
Shadow Cabinet Lord Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “profiteers” from utility companies.
The Lord Chancellor’s plans for the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water-supplying kingdoms may not recover their shares entirely, because the Labour government could charge “deductions” because of some found crimes.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers to the boards of directors of companies and create property funds through which to transfer 10% of the equity capital of private sector companies to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to about <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh would cause them to change their minds
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his candidacy as a Supreme Court justice by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators could be persuaded not to support him because of the FBI’s findings.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said that at the beginning of the hearings; I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, “Are you guilty?”
The answer was decided, prompt, unequivocal.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to have been dug in stone.
“I’m determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so there would need to be some explosive accusations,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett resolutely rejects the allegations,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she named confirmed the account.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt anything will change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive group of stars with an equally impressive mission: eliminating global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people to the Central Park lawn, not only to follow artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to pay for a number of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help raise global awareness of the goal of elimination.
But what success has the Global Citizen Festival had when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism,” a concept that refers to people who feel they have achieved something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, there have been more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who have promoted different goals.
These actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, for which at least $10 billion had already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries who have pledged to “help children grow to their full potential,” which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the book of history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced it would fund The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded, “It’s going to be a long and difficult road, sometimes we’ll fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the performers at this year’s event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces for a “blockade” to hamper Russia’s energy exports, Home Secretary says
Washington can, “if necessary,” turn to naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argues that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason I’m in the Middle East is because I want to broker the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods of managing the situation.
“The United States has the ability, through our naval forces, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade so that energy does not go out on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the U.S.
He went on to compare the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying Russia "knows only one trick" because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the existing pipeline’s capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said the US’s fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic motives and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we look at things in the same way: energy cannot be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Aleksandr Novak, Russia’s energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. energy secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position drew criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with the fact that a third state is interfering in our energy issues,” Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren ‘seriously thinks’ about running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she needed to “rethink seriously” whether to run for president after the midterm elections.
During the town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and that takes a strong woman,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether to run in the presidential election.”
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he “turned the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was a vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that even the majority of Warren’s voters don’t think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such an application.
The survey showed more support for a candidate for former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% oppose it.
Other well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s PTSD at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case.
“The things my own son goes through, the things he went through after he came back... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of PTSD and the aftermath of the wounds our soldiers are coming back to,” he told the audience gathered at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "return a little different, tougher, returning wondering if there is any respect for what they and their soldiers in the armed and air forces, as well as all other members of the Army, have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence, and holding a drunken firearm, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims trying to escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed an amicus curiae application in Washington on Friday to support a challenge to the policy on asylum seekers, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and his violent sons, members of a gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-appointed attorney representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing a widespread problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Council that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation.”
“Federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle,” the amicus curiae said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the lawsuit that the policy of denying immigrants entry is hurting the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape gang abuse and violence.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11, when announcing the policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems that people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the death toll doubled, in a race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
“The situation seems very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is easing her fever-stricken baby to an evacuation center in the shattered city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient."
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, were overwhelmed by the situation.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to his spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are being treated outdoors because of strong and continuous aftershocks.
He has eyes full of tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife cry out for help, then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my son.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Abusing’ ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to distribute propaganda material.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after he accused China of meddling in the Nov. 6 congressional election, a charge China rejects.
The allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercials promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war involving waves of tariff increases for imports.
The tariffs imposed by China in revenge at the start of the trade war were created to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, experts in China and the United States said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“When disseminating propaganda by publishing an advertisement in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the much-cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and a free press,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent views that Chinese citizens have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s leading newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans support and protect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from multiple allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and most Republicans who have spoken publicly about it intend to continue the vote.
“Such reactions will not be forgotten,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation will calm the angry electorate.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November's coming!" as they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very great,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
“People say they were already very big and that’s true.
But they could be even bigger, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed allegations of sexual abuse brought to the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
“This has turned into a mess for Republicans,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, but also about how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of the Democrats’ electoral support group Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part they should believe in according to the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe that Ford’s testimony is likely to have been true, while 35% said they strongly believe it or that Kavanaugh’s testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38 percent said Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford said under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had drunkenly abused her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals in front of her while attending a party while he was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Create a New Internet to Compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee’s open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is “global domination.”
“Now we have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data archives” or PODs.
It can contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries, or other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this “personal data consolidation”.
According to company CEO John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute appropriate resources, processes and skills in a way that makes Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely blown up at once.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a post published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over Internet neutrality.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The cleric who won the Victory Cross in the First World War is celebrated
The only Anglican clergyman to win a Cross Victory medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had been awarded the highest military honour in Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "wonderful symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery", paved the way for the soldiers, then attacked an artillery nest on his own and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to match, but that makes me feel humbled.”
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown after the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but received Peppa Pig cartoons instead
Imagine you stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, a star-studded event, just so you wouldn’t be able to watch the main event.
The schedule of the San Jose event contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all, because they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
One fan described the move to children's cartoons on Twitter as "some kind of a bad joke".
“Government regulations say this content isn’t suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Pig Peppa, yeah."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future they will schedule their events in such a way that they can also be followed by viewers in the UK.
“When I think about reruns, I think we could probably work it out,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won’t be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they were not all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We’re going to boil down to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We’ve tried to give fans more, and we’ve crossed the line.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘inferior’ because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn’t realize until he got to school that “not everyone is like me.”
Guest on Lauren Laverne’s first-ever Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the traditional show, will be missing a few months due to an illness.
Invited in Laverne's first edition, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable for me to like boys and girls."
He said, “So far, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, it was the real things that gave me the strength and endurance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove he was “someone,” he said, so he wouldn’t let everyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and has taken advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live freely, without consequences, and because he wanted to give others “hope.”
The triple world champion said he was "taken by surprise" by falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley last year married the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age,” he said, “he attended the first Olympics when he was just 14, and his father died of cancer after three years, it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has been through the same good times and bad.”
In June, they became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, Daley says, changed their “perspective.”
“If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested only in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if they had received tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be able to be first, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and died that I finally accepted that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that this is what I have dreamed of for a lifetime, to jump in front of spectators in my country at the Olympics, there is no feeling more beautiful,” he said.
This also inspired him in the music of his choice, Proud by Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excites him.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, was passed on the reserve bench on Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in the forty-seventh game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover in good shape so that this is not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on the reserve bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the U.S. team, the four-time major-tournament winner split his day between cheerleading for teammates and practicing his punches, hoping to make up for what he did wrong.
The 48-year-old has never had the straightest drives, not even in the best period of his career, so it’s not the best choice for Le Golf National’s narrow court, where long rough areas often punish mishap.
And if the field isn’t a big enough challenge, in Sunday’s ninth game Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who teamed up with rookies Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points at the entrance to the 12 singles games, which must start forcefully at this stage.
Furyk said he was confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else anyway.
“He fully understood the role he had today, he hit me on the shoulder, he hugged me and he told me he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Fame member and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably never imagined he would play in two games.
I imagined more, but that’s what happened, and that’s how I thought we should do it.
He wants to play, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never risen to the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought intangible advantages to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he likes to joke with players, he's a great guy in the team locker room," he said.
“I think the young players have fun glowing with him, it was fun to see them doing it during the week.
His role is more important, it’s not just about the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the considerable lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the singles competition in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama game, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but barely managed to defeat them with a minimal difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remember that we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win,” said Bjorn (pictured) after watching the 2018 team, which won 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now leads 10-6 on Le Golf National.
“So history shows me and my team that it’s not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at full speed.
Let’s get out on the ground and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are placed on the table.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We have always said, we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we also know what lies ahead on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Excited by the way his players have handled difficult terrain, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow is a completely different situation.
Tomorrow, individual performance is important, and this is different.
It’s great to be on the pitch with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re on your own, then you’re tested to the fullest, as a golfer.
This is the message that you have to convey to the players, that they have to be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes his players will play better in the singles event than they did with their partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such comebacks on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing team when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medina".
“I remember every word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, put a lot of pressure on those matches in the middle.
We created the right batch and ordered the players the way we wanted, you know, we’re trying to create a bit of magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
“I chose this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all the topics,” Bjorn said of the lot for the singles event.
Germany's new warship postponed again
Germany’s newest naval frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace outdated warships from the Cold War, but this will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new frigate class Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be introduced to maritime forces in 2014, but problems after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is assumed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vessel missiles, as well as with stealth technologies, which provide a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for the new frigates to depart on two-year missions without returning to their original port.
However, the continued delays mean that these state-of-the-art warships, which are said to increase Germany’s maritime strength, will already be outdated before they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unlucky frigate F125 was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available about the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that would have made the warship useless on a combat mission.
The software defects were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future equipment.
The 7,000-ton ship Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective mechanisms, the price of the entire project, including crew training, became a concern.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance given the latest warnings that Germany’s maritime power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence commission in Germany's parliament, acknowledged that the Navy "has begun to run out of ships that can be sent on missions."
The official said the problem has grown steadily over time, as old vessels have been taken out of service without being replaced by new ones.
He deplored the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates entered service in the Navy.
The National Trust is spying on the secret life of bats.
New research that is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how bats use the environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behavior of these unusual flying mammals and help future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland study will look at common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as eared bats and water bats from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and what species emit certain sounds.
A habitat map and a report will also be produced to create a detailed, scaled-up picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as turf creation, and what is the best way to maintain forest meadows for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work affecting their nests, as well as habitat loss.
Wind turbines and street lighting are also risks, as are traps for flies and some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who periodically conduct studies, control nests, and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organisation has even created Scotland’s first and only bat reserve, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of bats are found in Scotland.
Estate manager David Thompson says this is the ideal territory for bats.
“Here at Threade, the area is great for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to breed.”
It stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance work on properties, as simply unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chicks, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges against him were "fake news" and that some people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman identified as Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 for not talking about the incident.
Hours after the allegations were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said they were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the Golden Ball winner said in front of the camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible report of private life suspicions," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages equivalent to an amount appropriate to the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was “a good boy” in a “99 percent” proportion, and that he was betrayed by that “one percent.”
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims she addressed the police and that the photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the courtroom because she was "fearful of the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that she would "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that deal because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'would forever regret' loss of carmakers
Britain “would regret forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, Secretary of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, home to Toyota’s Auris and Avensis brands, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have said they fear leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “fixed-in-time” principle: For custom-made cars, parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which industrial manufacturers say could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more of its inventory for a day at its Derbyshire factory, the company says, so production would be stopped.
Clark said May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border delays.”
“There has to be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but from other manufacturers, shows that we need to be able to continue to use what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have to stop, but warned that higher prices could reduce the factory's competitive capacity in the long run and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United union at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: “Experience has taught me that, after disappearing, these jobs never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aid and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Rumors of Trump firing the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, have been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate legal committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which again postponed the Senate plenary vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "It has not yet been set a date for this. It may be this week or it may be postponed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by dislike of TV reporters who like to perform, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to perform."
He then suggested that there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president participates in more question-and-answer sessions than all previous presidents,” she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: “We analyzed the figures.”
“There will be more briefings,” Sanders said, “but I think it’s much better for the press to have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, not me.
We are trying to do this most of the time and you may have noticed that we have done this many times in recent weeks, and discussions with the President of the United States will replace press briefings when it becomes available.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visiting him.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, making an impromptu, sometimes bizarre, appearance in front of assembled reporters.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health addresses EU employees at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland in a letter on Brexit concerns.
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and the desire for them to remain even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter as it was less than six months before the UK withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to bear the costs for applications to receive permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, with decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head on Saturday in the game his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31-27, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State’s head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
“He got to the line and he just collapsed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on the oxygen mask by his physical trainers and medical staff on the bush line before being placed on a stretcher and transported from the field for a thorough evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/width of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a 2nd grade student, is in his first season at Tennessee State after relocating from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five plywoods in total before leaving the match, reaching a number of 18 plywoods throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher judicial stamp fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay a higher judicial stamp fee when buying a property in the UK, with the extra money to be used to help the homeless, according to new Conservative Party plans.
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with voting rights.
The judicial stamp duty will be applied to persons who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of the judicial stamp fee when buying a property in the UK, and the additional money will be used to help the homeless, as Theresa May is due to announce today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with voting rights, promising cheaper homes and targeting high-income earners.
The higher judicial stamp duty will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money obtained in this way will be used to support the Government’s efforts to help the homeless.
The surcharge, which is added to the current judicial stamp fee, including levels raised two years ago for the second property and properties purchased for rental purposes, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to add up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend a large part of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the judicial stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high as a result of buying land without using it, and asked Theresa May to waive taxes on affordable homes in order to solve Britain’s “household problem.”
Corbyn has announced a number of attractive real estate reform proposals, including checks on rents and the cessation of unreasonable evictions.
It also wants to give the councils greater powers when it comes to building new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I will dedicate my mandate as prime minister to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the existing problems in the real estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair for people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies with offices abroad, to be able to buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and living in unworthy conditions is far too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to be the manager of the Scottish national team”
Jack Ross, manager of the Sunderland football team, said that "his ultimate goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of "reviving" the northeastern club, which is currently ranked 3rd in the First League, with a three-point difference from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light team this summer after managing, last season, the return of the St. Mirren football team to the Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We’ve made it to the national team’s B team and that’s about it,” Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I’ve spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland’s Hampden games with my father and I’ve always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I succeed as manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors, as managers of Sunderland, include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he has no emotions to be the successor to such established names and such a prominent club after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The only thing that worries me and that could affect my success is the question, ‘Can I help this team get back into the Premier League?’
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities of this club allow it to be in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get her to get there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club’s return to the Premier League.”
Ross has only three years of leadership experience, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months as a member of the training staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover after relegating to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship title in the next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a decisive moment,” he said of the takeover of Alloa.
“I thought the role of manager was better for me than the role of player.
It may sound strange, because we had a good time, we won well and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them every week.
I’m facing similar situations as a manager, in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel it’s the right role for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do that, I feel like it’s the thing that suits me best in my entire adult life.”

The ideal time to drink a pint of beer is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey.
This summer’s heat wave has led to higher revenues in UK pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars reported an increase of 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business consulting representative who conducted the survey, said: “England’s constant warmth and participation in the World Cup for a longer period than expected contributed to a pattern in July, similar to that of the previous month, when pubs registered up to 2.8% more customers, while prosa restaurants had a longer period.
The number of customers lower by 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June fell further in July.
Pubs and bars that only serve drinks have recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
Pubs serving food also experienced heat losses, but not as large as those in restaurants.
It seems that people went out into the city just to drink drinks.
Sales of beverages at all bars and pubs increased by 6.6 percent this month, and food fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s representative for the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large-scale sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to the sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to suffer losses, although a 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales will add to current cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.”
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the small number of newly launched locations.
The company that monitors UK pub, bar and restaurant sales, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, which is the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret account on a social network that they hide from their parents.
According to a survey, one in five children, some as young as 11 years old, has a secret account on a social network that he hides from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake” Insta accounts.
The news heightened fears about posts with sexual content
20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create an account on a social network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid rise in “fake Insta” accounts, referring to the Instagram photo-sharing platform.
The news has heightened fears about posts with sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main” and “clean” account that they show to their parents, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who mistakenly discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, noticed the post of a teenager asking to be “raped.”
According to research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) in independent schools, 40% of 11 to 18 year olds have two profiles, and half of them have admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers do not have access to.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘Voice of Athletes’ in Scotland’s Athletes’ Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletes Commission at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated field and track athlete, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for decision-makers in sports to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes in Scotland, the UK, as well as around the world, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with his inclusion on the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle also said: “I am delighted that I will be able to represent the athletes and hopefully have a real contribution and can help the way sports are carried out in Scotland.”
The American athlete, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator on the BBC, has remained disabled after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will decide whether or not I will recover.
It was a titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
An advertisement for breast pumps that compares women to cows divides public opinion online
A company producing breast pumps has caused the division of public opinion in the online environment with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers with milking cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that is meant to be “the world’s first quiet, portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ironic ad, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom the new pump gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cow hay on a song that includes lyrics like, “Yes, I milk, but I don’t have a tail” and “if you haven’t noticed, these aren’t ugly, they’re my breasts.”
The refrain continues: “I pump, I pump, I breastfeed, I pump, I pump, I pump, I extract milk from girls.”
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has been the subject of mixed reactions from those who have viewed it, many of whom say it exposes the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
“Like us, they must remain pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen just a few days after birth.”
Elvie Breast Pump Discreetly Fits in a Breastfeeding Bra (Elvie/Mom)
Another person commented: “It’s understandable how traumatic it is, both for the mother and for the child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added: “An extremely inappropriate advertisement.”
Others defended the ad, with one person claiming to have found it a “hilarious” ad.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping really made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant," one person wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad that targets mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the toilet) and who feel like ‘poops.’
It’s not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they danced with discrete pumps inserted into the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their children in their arms and even get out into the city while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and design developer at Mother commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what the use of a breast pump entails and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made it to the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly transferred to a refugee camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of people who crossed the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children at sponsorships.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and fear that they will endanger their stay in the country if they ask to take children.
The risks increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data will be disclosed to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal history.
“About 80 per cent of people who are sponsors or sponsor family members live illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
To speed up the process of processing children in the system, the authorities have introduced new rules, under which children must appear in court one month after detention, rather than 60 days as the previous standard provided, according to shelter employees.
Many will plead the case through a video call, and not personally before an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more they can become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports issued by the system in recent months.
The lawyers said these concerns are heightened at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating a child has problems are not noticed because of the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria Calls for US, French and Turkish Military Forces to Withdraw Immediately
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also acting prime minister, said foreign military forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the guise of fighting terrorism and that "the situation will be properly managed".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.”
In Syria, there are about 2,000 U.S. military troops, mainly training and advising Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
Also, in the war-torn country there are more than 1,000 French military troops.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said there were favourable conditions for their return and accused "several Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears", prompting the refugees to keep their distance.
He added: “We have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return.”
“Political influences are being brought into an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to drive out the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped prevent a large-scale assault with the help of Syrian forces, backed by Russians, on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, who have ties to the Al-Qaeda network and who “will be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy, hopes to meet soon in a first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the committee's activities should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning regarding interference.
Why Trump will win his second term
If we follow this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment proceedings or scandals end his term as president earlier, which much of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case it would be, without a doubt, “the most dramatic end of a presidential term of all time!”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, prime-time audiences have doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News is watched by an average of 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was watched by 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people watching it on major news nights.
“This is a subject that appeals to the public, because we can’t understand it,” said Neal Baer, the producer of ABC’s “Reserve President” drama series, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedic writer with extensive experience in the field and the author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is harnessed.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can also be made complete about the state of the global economy.
Changing the post is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you’re not just an informed citizen when you get to the Trumps’ sixth hour of watching the debate by an expert committee on how Bob Woodward uses “deep background” sources for his book, “Fear,” about Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket and his $15,000 suit.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“A lot of what he does gives you the feeling that you’re watching a reality show and it feeds you with topics every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Axes of the Pawn,” about Trump’s constantly changing cast and daily turnarounds.
You can’t afford to miss an episode, because you’ll feel like you’ve been left behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his home on the northern shore of Kauai Island, outside it was 27 degrees and it was sunny, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the television, especially as Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate’s legal committee and decided on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing some unusual shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it looks like they were right.”

Overwhelming external financial resources for the tightest midterm elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of electoral districts, resulting in two mandate holders in an electoral race for the same office, it is hardly surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th electoral district enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of the district of Pittsburg brought to the race the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th constituency, which significantly overlaps with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional, manipulating district boundaries in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th electoral district sparked a competition to fund campaigns between major party funding bodies, the Congressional Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special, high-profile election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
For more than a decade, the office had been held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has won in this district by a 20-point gap.
According to political commentators, the Democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador because of its deal with China, but then gave up.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners evacuated the Trump Organization leadership team.
State Department officials decided to call US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were considered only against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid worth about $140 million in 2017, including for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and crime in it.
As domestic meetings progressed, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they remain anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next thing that could happen is Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on President Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
Mueller also appears to be directing his investigation into the existence of a plot between Trump’s campaign and Russia regarding the attack on the U.S. election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face due accountability within the body, even as he prepares to stand before voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that a “fall” of Trump is inevitable, which is also true for his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will decide the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to strike a coup against Hitler, only if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a few such critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this newspaper that last year he suggested secret registration of the president and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if he is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match against the Austrians, after Spain’s impressive equal against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performances.
“It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We started the match thinking we would get a good result and we won a point.
We probably could have scored at the end, but overall, I think the tie was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we scored better in the second.
Thursday will again be an important night for Europe.
With a little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last match played. However, having the support of the supporters, we will surely feel even more motivated and have a positive result.
“Last year was clearly a difficult one, given my injuries and the changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is fine and the guys really like to be here; the training is also going well.
Let’s hope that we persevere, that we leave behind what happened in the last season and that we will have good results.”
Women suffer from insomnia due to retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to family members about it.
Approximately half of those who participated in the Nationwide study said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them said they were talking to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t start this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide the care you need if you don’t make your wishes known in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: the financial advisor can also be of real help in terms of paying these expenses.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses, or you can insure your own well-being – as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: deal with problems of a legal nature.
Obtain a medical decision-making authority to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals respect your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Also consider making a power of attorney with respect to your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you do not have the necessary capacity to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: imagine that a parent of yours at an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are in charge of it?” asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of their dog?
Write a plan for all these things.”
A man was shot several times with a compressed-air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed-air rifle as he walked home after a night in the city.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2:30 a.m., as "random shooting".
The victim was unable to see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police have called on witnesses to make statements.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia's Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, from the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi Island, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that stretches on a coastline with an area of more than 300 km in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regency, an administrative region that lies below a province, has a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fish farming and agriculture are the central focus of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining activities are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Donggala Regency, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Circle of Fire, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004 – A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the Richter scale struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake on the Richter scale occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya Regency of Aceh, causing damage and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami that resulted in a large number of deaths.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died from the collapsed buildings.
2018: Several powerful earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded under rubble.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska’s former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, involved in a domestic violence complaint and in opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska state police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance of his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is in police custody at the Mat-Su unit pending trial, and is being held on a $500 bond without bail, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he was declared “100 percent innocent” when asked to plead, according to the network.
Palin faces three class-A criminal charges, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with such crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending trial at the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, becoming involved in a domestic violence crime complaint and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend’s statement, he punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with his post-traumatic stress disorder after being part of the Iraqi military.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred off central Sulawesi province, which is in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
U.S. Attorney's Office Demands Capital Punishment for New York City Terrorist Attack Suspect
The New York federal prosecutor wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan’s West Side Highway, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on its path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the death penalty notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both indictments can receive a death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts including eight counts of crime in support of organized crime, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s execution as “odious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, suffering and loss to the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last trial of a capital punishment case in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after they were convicted on charges of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he was pleased with what he had done, according to police.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after he looked at ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
Also, according to police, he asked to fly the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the ex officio defenders who represented Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the death penalty decision, instead of accepting a plea of guilt with life imprisonment, with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s team of defenders has previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has vowed to “mobilize the civilian army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of parliament Theresa May who suggested he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the UK would have “exited” by now if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge faced by May in the highly divided camps has been heightened by members of the Conservative Party who have joined another protest against a planned exit from the European Union in the city.
The prime minister is making every effort to ensure that his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, is properly carried out, confronting attacks from those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to remain in it, as well as from the European Union.
The Allies stressed that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and “chaos”.
Bone said at the Solihull “Leave Means Leave” pro-Brexit event that he wants to “give up the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If things were led by him, we were no longer in the European Union,” he said.
The Conservative member of Parliament, Wellingborough's constituency representative, added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied suggestions on changing public opinion in the 2016 vote: “It is not at all true that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the Union.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
“The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it and neither do our activists who take to the streets and who support us, in the first place, in the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message to Theresa May, she added: “The prime ministers who remain in office are the ones who keep their promises.”
At the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians must be put under “pressure” if they are to give up the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let them do that.”
In a message to the enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the civilian army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of remaining in the European Union marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that read “The Conservative Party is against Brexit” after the group launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at Conservative Party members and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can deploy IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for the digitization of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a farce.
Brexit does not bring benefits,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in the November election against Geoff Diehl, a member of the House of Representatives from the Republican Party, who was co-chair of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with citizens with voting rights using the mayoral format since Trump took office as president.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that “the time has come for women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our severely affected government, and this includes a woman at the head of it.”
A suspect has been arrested in the case of the death that caused the death of the Sims player from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the death that caused the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday had been arrested.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET news conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, that he was in possession of a gun, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the original lot in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after his team helps him win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will play a key role in the race.
Being at the top of the standings, Bottas had a good start and nearly defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at boxing and left Hamilton at the queue, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the boxing pitch one lap later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to move forward after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free, after making a double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the race on the back row of the frame and was in seventh place near the end of the first lap, on the very day he was 21 years old.
Then he was in the lead for much of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
Finally, he stopped at the box at lap 44, but could not step up in the last eight laps, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
“It was a tough day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me get through.
And the team did an excellent job of winning against Ferrari and achieving this double," Hamilton said.
A terrible body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not facilitate the “leakage” of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter, which accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are “bad, immoral, and liars.”
“The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and lying,” he said.
“When you see that they published and leaked information and then say that they didn’t.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the “leakage” of the document?
Do you remember her answer? She said, umm... why?
Aaa... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we do that? ... No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "leaked" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "leakage" occurred from her office.
“I have not concealed the allegations against Ford and I am not the one who facilitated the leak of her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep my privacy and that’s exactly what I did.”
But her denial doesn’t seem to have bothered the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “To be honest, it was terrible body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the most terrible body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing the defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to take power in every possible way.
Observe the wickedness, the immorality, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to destroy in order to gain power and control,” the president said, according to the website Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 over Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars paid for Friday's Elite League loss, winning in front of the Belfast Giants in Saturday's comeback with a 5-3 score in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead, with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier taking the shots.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back in front of the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard tied the score for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's players, who had regained ground by beating the Dundee team 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening performance kicked off in the fourth minute, 3:35, respectively, from a pass by Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a match that began so dynamically, Sullivan brought the host team back into the game in the 13:10 minute, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie the opportunity to score for an equal score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage before the first break, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first half.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard again equalled an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus securing the team's fifth-place finish midway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died after securing the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero, dying after securing the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake shook Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several powerful aftershocks in the area and many people are stuck under the remains of Palu city.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower of Palu's struggling Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that he was on the verge of collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s air navigation service provider said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are saddened by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency saying access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“We believe that the number will increase because many victims are still under the ruins and we did not have access to many of them,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six meters high devastated the city of Palu, with a joint funeral scheduled for Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings casualties.
It is almost impossible to find drinking water.
All mini-markets are looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to provide aid to the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
“Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a person is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one person is missing, after previously saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger has been missing since Saturday afternoon.
She also said she was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional passenger details, such as age or nationality.
The locals' boats were used to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Naval Forces said the plane missed the runway and ended up in a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses believe the plane crossed the end of the runway.
U.S. nationality passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very short distance from the ground.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to cross the water, which had reached the waist, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Naval Forces said sailors working nearby to renovate a jetty jumped to the rescue, using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank 30 feet underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini plane.
Analyst Reveals Chronology of the Night a Woman Was Burned to Death
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office closed its plea for resumption of trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and his victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting her earlier claims, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
The moment the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was summoned to the witness box and confessed that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he “lied because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final pleading on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to change the negative way this kind of music is seen, with the help of songs with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed says hip-hop has ceased to convey political messages and address social issues, as it did initially.
They want to go back to their origins and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
A recent renaissance of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the United Kingdom has been observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York babysitter sues couple for firing her after receiving ‘racist’ text message
A nanny in New York sues a couple for dismissal on discriminatory grounds after accidentally receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was “still a black person.”
The couple denied they were racist, saying she sued them for “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first day at work in 2016.
“Wow, one more person of color,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the mistake, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, saying that the nanny, who is African-American, did not perform her duties properly and that she expected to receive a nanny of Filipino nationality, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her work day and sent home with Uber.
Now, she is suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal and is claiming $350 a day for six months, the period she was supposed to live with them and do business, despite the fact that this was done without a contract concluded.
“I want to show them that they don’t do such things,” she told the Post newspaper on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denied claims that they were racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent him the wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco, her husband, told the Post newspaper.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you wronged, even if by mistake?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Considering the trial an “extortion” action, Plasco said his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person in such circumstances?
This is not the case," the banker added.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for their behavior and logic.
Editors of Paddington’s story feared readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s very funny now, after seeing that Paddington had a huge success.”
She said her father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the anniversary on the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was a "sweet-yellow" one after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success she enjoyed afterwards.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not your success.
I think that’s how he saw Paddington’s success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to credit Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad calls me frequently to tell me that it’s very serious and that he doesn’t think he’ll survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she’s going to die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, “Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medication given by doctors to keep her heart pumping blood began to diminish and to come out of her body.
He had died a short time ago and his organs were no longer functioning.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was happening.
I couldn’t scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, grieving after the death of his daughter, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I kept my head down and the tears kept flowing.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two bereaved women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and include phone numbers that people can call for support.
Sharon Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a grinning smile.
“Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said that his smile changed your mood.
However, he gave up work before he died because he had arrived at a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Davis said, “I keep thinking it’s going to have a domino effect.”
She created the messages “to communicate to people that they can reach out to someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Get out, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' longtime friend, lost Mark, her 15-year-old life partner, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or that he was depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he had changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children opened their presents and he didn’t even look them in the eye.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but she must overcome it: “It caused immense pain within the family.
We are devastated.
But we have to go on and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as the Federal Bureau of Investigation begins its investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for — a limited-time, small-scale investigation — we might have a little bit of unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears the committee is on track to “disintegrate” amid a partisan blockade.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks until the Nov. 6 election — if Republicans are expected to do poorly, their attempts to place the one they want to win in the election for the country’s highest court will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush appealed to the senators to persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make a difference in the case of a tie and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean fugitives is falling under Kim's leadership.
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said about 1,127 people fled the country last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tougher border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by those illegally transporting people across the border.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
A vast majority of North Korean fugitives are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two sides of Korea.
China considers the fugitives to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for several talks on denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to work together for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused that U.S. sanctions have caused a lack of progress since then.
“If we cannot trust the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and in such situations we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as “hysterical,” saying he is unable to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, as "hysterical" and said his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate legal committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and lost his voice because of his emotions while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and coordinated character assassination,” organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony showed she can't serve on the Supreme Court because it showed she is biased against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi deviated from the topic when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I just want to say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he’s not fit, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say ‘wow! how wonderful!’,” Pelosi said.
And women need to be able to handle it.
It is a justified diatribe, there are months and years of accumulated anger and he cannot speak without bursting out in tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do I?”
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman in an executive position, who told me that she also cried when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to: ‘You might think I was sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then go on.
I thought it was a brilliant thing.”
Tears are allowed for the exteriorization of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I began to cry because of an inexpressible anger, is that I was grabbed by the neck of an older woman, a cold director with whom I always felt a little bit afraid, and she took me up the stairs.
“They should never see you crying,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
I think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they caused you that feeling.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressional Democrat in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought she had no reason not to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she says laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was coming to an end, she was behind with the fundraiser and vowed that she would not enter the race unless she managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000, they were only giving her $250.
“Do they think I’m getting discounts?” she asked.
During her speech announcing that she would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by emotions – as a result of gratitude to the people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – that she lost her voice.
“You would have said I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls of the media’s reaction to her.
“You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex.”
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my gravestone.
“Did he cry?”
How can the U.S.-China trade war benefit Beijing?
The salvos that heralded the start of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while there seems to be a long way to go until it is over, the two countries’ quarrels could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with new tariffs hitting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all Chinese goods arriving in the United States.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has warned it will respond to every blow from the United States, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly giving in to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. pressure on the trade war could support China positively in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than previously expected,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of experts.
Syria ready for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists so that things return to normal.
The existing conditions allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after beating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded its sixth consecutive win in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who put in incredible effort for much of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial shot in the water to hairline 3 at hole 16, handing the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all halves, becoming one of four players with a 5-0-0 result since the current format of the tournament, since 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost at holes 5 and 4 to the player from the last place in the standings of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost at holes 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, probably his last game in the Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup veteran who has participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most victorious player in Europe, averaging 25.5 points in his entire career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am extremely happy that I was able to win the cup again.
It's a team effort and I'm glad we could be of help," Garcia said, excited after the European victory.
He hands the baton to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, and I used to watch his games as a kid,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team put a real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinarily throughout the entire tour.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: “I’m proud of them, they really did their best.
This morning there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a tough fight.
Put your hat down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be their captain.
We must give them due respect.
They played better than us.”
