At the end of the exchanges, the Prague stock exchange plunged into the negative
After the fall on Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trades.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of trading, the Prague stock exchange resumed its fall the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in Wall Street stocks.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan for the stabilization of the American financial sector, is thus also perceptible in our country.
Falling stocks in Asia
Asian stock exchanges suffered a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the indices managed, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney Stock Exchange stocks were losing more than five percent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“Hesitation about bailout action in the U.S. will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk that other countries would be affected.
The Bloodbath of American Actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the financial system support project, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (nearly K<0xC4><0x8D> 12 billion).
Legislators dismissed President George Bush’s call for support.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday and major stock indexes experienced the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones lost nearly seven percent, having experienced such a drop for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Gives Up: U.S. Government Can Inject $700 Billion Into Banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial aid agreement for the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. lawmakers were making a turning point in talks to adopt a bailout in the form of $700 billion in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
However, success is not certain.
Indeed, before the final version of the law can be published and put to a vote, Congressmen must finalize a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulation Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to a vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which aid to markets can be effective, a "disillusionment" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form the package of measures for market stabilization should take," Democratic Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, in order to give the government a final form.
It is expected to buy back unsold real estate assets from financial corporations that cause financial firms to suffer significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
This market recovery plan still needs to be pursued, but I think we are there," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on falling stock markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to get Congress to reach a final deal as early as Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading begins on Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the congressional decision could affect Monday’s trades.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to say for certain when the two Houses of Congress will proceed with the vote, or if the negotiations are not likely to be blocked at the last moment by this or that problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount allocated to support the system should be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be made available as soon as possible.
But if Congress gets the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the possibility of blocking the grant of the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the president may veto this decision, Congress has the option of making it a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to get finances for the purchase of bad real estate titles, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
“All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says lawmakers have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the relief agreement, the progress of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for the limitation of such golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress toward a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides for help for real estate owners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new advances for mortgages it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
“And this is due to the fact that we don’t know what the mechanism and price will be for the repurchase of problem assets.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the share of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is not, according to Marek, as important as that.
“It is far more important that Congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that we dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," Marek stressed.
A fight pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
However, there are enough reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house an expensive high-end gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are stacked vinyl records in your shelves, with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same goes for music on the move, i.e. compressed music, to put it simply - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would have a hard time supporting earphones bought for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are features that are, of course, unknown to most mobile devices.
No device today is as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, it is able to read music and movies, record them, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if we take Smartphones and communicators into account, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator can grill meat and no TV will take pictures, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the shorter the interval between reloads.
And music reading is one of the most important energy streams.
There are few mobile phones that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobile phones, expect that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second recharge for work - this is valid even for more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, following a reload, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Music can, of course, be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
As far as drives are concerned, you do not need, except for iPod, any software.
Simply fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers will themselves create a media library classified according to the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or according to the judgment of the user.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, similar to the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a concrete device, be especially interested in the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, ease of control.
If the music is for you, basically, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen to it that for a limited time, for example taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3s.
Virtually all mobile phones are capable of this today.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to play.
All get to play the MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have just this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play music in WMA format.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods), on the other hand, is less common.
High-end mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
All you need to do is to visit the corresponding operator's (or other provider's) web pages from your mobile phone and purchase the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to purchase a musical mobile.
The offer of the operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, to radio tubes quickly made.
The prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to take the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers, which have virtually all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three and four thousand crowns, one can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped, also equipped with an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Really anyone manages to ensure the command of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the command to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet connected by chance, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (M2 type, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive come out even with 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the ease of control is close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the farthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a longer battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Possibly.
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the European Commission's latest steps in the field of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly said that in Czech Republic there is no room for another operator, choruses with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network apparently does not have much luck (in fact, now it would find frequencies only difficult).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable drop in prices, to which the traditional operators had to react.
However, even before the introduction of partying problems such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, voices similar to those we hear today were heard in Great Britain.
However, it turned out that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let’s add that behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which among other things owns the U:fon in Czechia.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be efficient, they need much fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
This is how in the world, virtual operators are emerging as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in Britain at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity stunt.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work in our country as well.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
It seems nevertheless almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in Czechia, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokesman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any event, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that a potential competitor can not appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of corporate customers, has not hidden, for a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations,” said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So the future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it looks like we might be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
“At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with others very specific.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the Press Department of Telefonika O2 said in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> says in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
“It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement.”
Vodafone instead directs its attention to fulfilling requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared fees and infrastructure.
This, in our opinion, means the most input from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s core strategy in this area is to discover a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in line with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to lower prices and therefore a decrease in their profit.
What is the point of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to understand each other as thieves at fairs. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also bears witness to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, when the U:fon was created, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> web pages.
Now, today, the U:fon lends itself as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> noted: "Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high demands."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, it is not only the attitude of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problematic, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the leasing of the necessary infrastructure.
No agreement of this kind has been reached at this time, because the offer of potential interested parties has not a priori presented enough interest for conventional operators," Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS said in response to our question.
A statement made in this way would not come as a surprise by representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one takes advantage of its position in the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices of mobile phone services."
However, pushing for an honest functioning of the market and lowering prices is apparently not in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises quite naturally.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all petrol stations is probably due to chance and the hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not found any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore no operator has an increased corresponding responsibility for its market behaviour.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are likely to be lacking even in the telecoms regulator," Chaloupa said in his statement.
One of the many points of disagreement is the interpretation of the dominant market position.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets carried out by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator quite logically has a monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are visibly proceeding in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in the negotiations with all operators.
Putting responsibility back on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in communications, by means of which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to extend the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications in the newly adopted Telecommunications Act, although many experts have promised to improve the situation.
This, the representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know very well, but their interests seem to lie elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but these are only partly public.
In most cases, it is about companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Personalized mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected officials.
The trick consists in the fact that the company makes in front of the operator figure of a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special price offers (and others).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you're talking about happens, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would consider and that could result in a termination of the collaboration with the company in question," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said in a statement.
Nevertheless, it is rather unlikely that an echo of such activity has not reached the heads of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, is against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them not-negligible benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators.
But this is precisely what should seem strange to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another question arises at <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively broad powers to reveal such an activity, and although it will not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, the conventional operators tried sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that regulatory bodies have intervened in developed countries, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and informal pressure, they ended up with the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are treating this issue like a hot potato that you get rid of by passing it on to a nearby target.
Following the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is in these cases more than beneficial to them.
But let's not throw the sleeve after the hit.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at our site, the Czech mobile market may be on the move again.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will hardly be able to remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
We have four versions - with a solo male or female song, an interpretation with chorus and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to make sure that the two singers, as well as the chorus, have a good diction, so that we understand the words well, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first resounded in 1834 on the plates of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka (Kermesse of the savetiers), Czech original piece by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl, accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip in its ticketing system on Wednesday
On Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik (Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will get on the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a coupon 30 days or 90 days (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it registered on their smart card in the information points and offices of the Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l.
As of yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying coupons via the internet on the web pages of the Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who start using the online store can permanently forget the ticket offices in the metro stations, where they had until now to trample on long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon online and they will save it on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen M<0xC4><0x9B>stsk<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is a ticket office with trained staff, which will help the interested parties with the purchase over the internet and, in addition, will record the coupon they have bought on their card," says project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Alongside the libraries, it will also be possible to register electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the lobby of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recall the machines to compose the tickets and the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
Automate will control the coupon in place of the driver
The automata that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply insert the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
In the suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xA1> integrovan<0xC3><0xA1> doprava (integrated transports from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal tickets of the Ropid organization, which designs the schedules of the Prague public transport.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s checkout.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard in the place indicated on the side of the checkout.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not take the peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which the validity of their voucher expires, can rejoin the vending machines, initially used to register the vouchers on the card.
It is there, on the screen of the device, that information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
Sudetenland demanded a referendum in the US
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that <0xC5><0xA0>umava be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>esk<0xC3><0xA1> v<0xC4><0x9B>deck<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna (The Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This stems among other things from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>esk<0xC3><0xA1> v<0xC4><0x9B>deck<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna.
Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov in the letter begged the US president not to allow "<0xC5><0xA1>umavsk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC5><0xBE>upa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, to whom the fate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava cares."
Given that the rallies to Czechoslovakia are allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, disrespectful attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take in his hands the protectorate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has not contributed in any way to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants," the letter read.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to foresee that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted to such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would obtain some kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein region's capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him for him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that once they got home, the Czech would benefit them,” Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek believes it will discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour at the wheel.
This campaign, which costs 150 million euros, will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You do not think" is capitalized on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
This must symbolize that you can pay with life a moment of inattention.
The spots will haunt viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of the accidents can be commonly seen.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The sugar and whip strategy against drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by the fact of saving time, when they toast a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to the drivers," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, says the psychologist.
In his view, signs signaling danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static warning sign is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n said.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli Provisional Government, called for the restitution of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made the statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert told the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since without it, peace will not be made," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he later pointed out.
Retirement from the Golan Heights
Olmert also supported Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was a prerequisite for a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan retreat," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of jihad (holy war) in Iraq.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance car is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move inside the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess was killed, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the path of the coach.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus can have an accident, or even brake abruptly, also when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is under its technical data sheet equipped with standing places or not.
If this standing equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The Student Agency long-distance coaches do not have standing spaces; this has been confirmed to Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"This is an issue that we have discussed with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got passengers to go to the toilet during the trip provided they had their own seat," he said.
The law ignores the steward.
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescriptions deal with this role.
On the other hand, there is also no legal requirement prohibiting the carrier from offering services.
The road transport law only knows the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," added Spokesperson Hanzelka more ambiguly.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the director of the road traffic department, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the problem.
"It all depends on whether the coach has in its homologation the permission to offer standing places.
It’s all in there,” he said.
Coaches are divided into urban, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, long-distance with standing places and a higher allowed speed, and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest allowed maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, an expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in planes.
There, too, he is not sure when turbulence will occur and the flight attendant may bump her head.”
"In the event that the bus braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards through internal prescriptions," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to remove these services
The Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer the services of stewards.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their trade to be a risky trade.
“However, as soon as I feel like it’s a risky job, I’ll remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper upon boarding.
It would also reduce costs,” he says.
The safety concern is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses. We have been opposed to this from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz a year ago.
A Great Tragedy Has Arrived
A young hostess from the region of Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who had been working for the company for two years, was killed in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a flashing light and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he approached it from his right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses that the two seats reserved for the stewards’ rest were sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the family of the girl, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but with regard to financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been in the works for more than a year, by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the movements of stewards on board the coach.
"It has not come to any conclusions on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that would fundamentally jeopardize the safety of passengers," said spokesman Hanzelka, adding that the control of the safety of buses is under the power of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
The key words were not lacking in the letter sent by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be constituted, according to the letter made public on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "skill block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive turning point for other concentrations in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is still under heavy pressure.
It was not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that, only recently, made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, there has been talk for some time - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some form between Deka Bank, which knows the customers of the Sparkasse through their investment funds, and WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank, Franz Waas, said at the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, be it Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and by the groups of savings banks, has instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with the WestLB with a view to joint commercial activities.
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks, however, have only just begun, it is said in the financial square.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees counts as one of the largest employers in the Frankfurt financial centre, has come into play when it comes to the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and the Halbab.
Yet nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
As soon as the plans had been made public, the government of the Land of Hesse pronounced itself against any Hellaba participation in them.
Afterwards, the other two houses did not join either.
The Bank of the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate was instead attached to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the regrouping of the Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba board of directors, had spoken out against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Independently of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the Bavarian state parliament election has passed, a union of BayernLB with the Baden-Wuttenberg state bank could come to fruition first.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for new mergers were to increase, the potential partners would gradually escape it.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although until then it had better withstood the crisis than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thüringen Savings and Transfers Group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain in rigor.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one facet.
Another facet raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be matched.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of which business model the future capacity of the Länder's banks should be ensured had hitherto not been resolved by the German grouping of savings and transfer funds.
In the long run, a carving of WestLb could take place, carving which is obviously not desired here.
This is also what is discussed in the letter of the governing committee in place: in any case, a <0x60>global solution' would be envisaged for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, nearly a barrel of five liters of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built bearded man who shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival what deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then kisses him.
From Bologna, they came all the way to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta Nueva station, four buses take tonight departure at 11:45 pm, <0x60>destinazione Monaco, festa della bira', arrival scheduled at 6:30 am.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses traveling Brazilians exclusively.
In one corner of the parking lot, South Americans are singing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For five years, they have been going to the beer festival, already three trips just this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would entail unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking group manager - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run at night on the Autostrada direction <0x60>Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet on the bus, travelers sleep.
It's better that way, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Brixen, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates are once again taking a break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco’s group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned in the parking lot near the Therese Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, wear a small yellow cap.
Above it is written on the left <0x60>Beer Festival', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency <0x60>conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
"When the doors of the beer tent open, we run," Marco shouted in the early morning.
<0x60>Run!' Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
<0x60>Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we have to distribute them in the room!'
The cup, Marco says, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instructions!
<0x60>Show the security guards that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!”
Third: 'Tonight, being back here ten and a half hours ago!' Understood?
And that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that'
On the way, someone ties yellow caps to the trees to find the way, to the signs and even to an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the <0x60>week-end of the Italians'.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who set off through the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come intentionally from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven policemen from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place before the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Nights of insomnia for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Finance Minister only a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word "relatively" and that he slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis movements.
This actually happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a loan of one billion to protect itself from the turbulence of the markets.
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid credits are issued up to an amount of 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would thus be entitled.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, it is the daughter company Depfa that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible because of mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, the equity rate also had slightly weakened from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
On-going and net profits from financial transactions were down to zero compared to the same period a year earlier, profits from the allocation of fixed receivables and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen by more than 70 per cent to €5 million.
And it was only thanks to the significant profits from the repayment of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the book interest repayment of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the earnings deficit of about 16 percent proved to be moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated poorly on industrial real estate loans, which had then been subordinated to Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter company, the Hypo Real Estate must depreciate which should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group's gains and losses, which still remains rather vague.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had already been cut by two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other refinancing-dependent institutions in the inter-bank market since it has no client deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has again considerably stagnated, with the banks accumulating their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 billion euros - of all the credits of the Depfa of a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing need is covered by medium-term credit and the company is protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of business at present.
Other sources say refinancing would be secured through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, however, explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group in the market is now assured.
The bank’s shareholders and creditors can only hope for this.
However, given the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But neither can the opposite be ruled out.
After the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still on the doorstep of insolvency Sunday evening, this rescue, at least provisional, will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The share price fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While debt in the first place has barely moved, the prices of second-rate loans are declining.
Most affected are the investment funds of the former daughter company Württemberg Hypo and those, of course, which have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of Hypo Real Estate Bank previously seemed to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself that brought the crisis into the establishment through the purchase of Depfa Bank.
As long as the issuing institutes, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, we can assume a reversal of arrears in time.
Or something will happen that no one dares to hope for right now – that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached security has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should reserve nights of insomnia above all for long-term creditors on the decision whether they should part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they drew a line from to defer losses for the next few years on the next capital income tax on stock market gains automatically levied.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop shows up for her first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start laughing: German is so "kawaii"!
What the hell does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Trade Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
What was I excited about?
The way to school was scary.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be set as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a round of tables begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not the type to like to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I did not have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue high socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I showed up in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all performed low masses, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii."
I knew him through my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable for the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor for the correspondent to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all pulled out their Bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the wretched German snacks.
I had herbal rice, small sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What is sure is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salted plums, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I wonder if I can see it here too.
“Why Japan in particular?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always answered:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
At the end of the day, reading manga has been my favorite thing for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at some point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats have feelings too.
A rat or a cockroach flees in the face of danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he experiences the same thing when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the questions of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter into difficult practicable terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it dies, flees, or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At the very least, therefore, for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity could lie in the linguistic nature of Man: much of his existence being related to language, it often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is so difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, analysed based on our own experience, then its observation poses great problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is next to it another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies of primate short-term memory, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in performing visualization.
But what does this mean for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the localized defense system in the brain (or its sequels, such as the reactions of the body) seizes the living memory.
Thus observed, the emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others other than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities are born in the body sensation regions of the cortex and brain stem, as does Jaak Pankseep who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could quite participate in transversal sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in humans and rats is likely to be felt as fear in both cases: yet how could one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but if it feels fear?
In my opinion, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Certainly, the nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain trunks, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem at the origin of sensations?
And even if we could prove it to humans, how could we prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely completely different from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than rat emotional sensations.
In any case, progress is made on the nervous plane insofar as the same is measured in rats and in humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist.
This could be seen as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly bump into a wall.
I am an emotional pragmatist.
UEFA President Platini: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a testament to its confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik said.
“But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can no longer waste time.
We have to work at maximum speed," Ukrainian League President Grigory Surkis said.
"UEFA is constantly watching us."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in accordance with the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured the UEFA President in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have already been convicted of mandatory relegation manipulation in the previous season; in the end, the start of the League has even had to be shifted to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignantly counterattacked
She wanted to promote for a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview — and is now in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has unveiled her former adulterer Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counter-attacks.
A late Rose War for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - seen and heard by everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke to the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage failure: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
She would have been aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - there is told the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his qualification as an unfaithful husband fell through: it would be “Monsterous,” he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News, that “Meg once again retraces the history of our relationship and manipulates it.”
It would also be “regrettable” for “the pain and upheaval of a divorce for every child to be revived in public” for their 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his response to the claw: "At any rate, my life goes on.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well.”
Prices of plane tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would again be advantageous - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after a price increase in the first quarter, established a clear decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After prices in the hotel market have been rising for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the weak dollar price that led to a “declining travel appetite of American tourists.”
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are up 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was up in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, very fuel-consuming, even increased up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for economy-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in business-class and first-class, however, price changes were significantly less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even halved according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be, on the one hand, a flexing economic growth, explains the firm.
Demand would yield ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the "Open Skies" treaty that liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the elimination by airlines of unprofitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay still failed to find a functional eleven.
De Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player did not return to the game until late and his shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
“We need this second goal,” Hermann Rieger whistled in the hallway of the Hamburg arena.
Not much was going on in the locker rooms, the half-time was over and most had sat down in their place.
Rieger was for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received in strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with that second goal!
The implementation was lacking.
"Not everything was very beautiful to see today," later confessed Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard "would also have wanted to be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 in the half), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful header by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not harm the weak players of Hamburg.
“It was a dirty win,” Marin Jol summed up.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121st birthday on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional leaderboards on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to take a step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
He doubts that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the first League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debauched from FC Bayern - is forming slowly, but it does not shine yet.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones to fall temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a little bit.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock index was 10,579 points, with a decline of well over five percent.
The stock market index of Nasdaq technologies was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The biggest losers of the Dow Jones were at that date American Express which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No securities could make any more profits.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs fell by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had partnered with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the sum must not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in line with the evolution of the price in order to reduce the burden on the public treasury.
Stock prices sucked into the whirlpool in Europe and the United States
The billions in aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not meet the concerns of investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is collapsing despite the state’s planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular falls in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The share of the Bavarian real estate financier lost three quarters of its value at the time despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank reported a decline of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped significantly below the important psychological bar of 6000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government’s $700 billion bailout could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, with the vote in the Senate expected to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also experienced only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index fell by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s top Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after an initial rise of 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor’s shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism multinational also said that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers perplexed: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Because of soon-frozen fuel lines, cryogenic death threatens her.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, Earth for example.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
That’s what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects don’t always behave 100 percent the way they’re expected according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the level of speed.
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They named it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still believes that Einstein was not wrong and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth,” he writes.
Space researchers have known about the existence of dark matter only for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter would still make up a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt are expected to be released as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-release shooting, six hostages were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be underway.
The Germans are constantly in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are in the process of verifying their state of health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well and safe, Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
Circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers were close to ending the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security agent, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting a bell.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the officer said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday shot dead six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom payment.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers found a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law "that led to suicide"
A court has been informed that years of abuse inflicted by her father-in-law have led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro High Court ruled that he regularly bonded his stepdaughter, Stéphanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: “I feel responsible for his death.”
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child living in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual acts while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that National Trust volunteer Ms. Randle was haunted by the abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told the court that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared since 2006 “emotionally dead,” and had “lost all hope for life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's father-in-law, who had written a letter of confession that ended: "I tied and bandaged her regularly."
“I didn’t abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim certainly had to be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the suicide of the victim.
And what’s even more amazing is the fact that if she hadn’t done that, her story would certainly never have ended in court.”
He added: "I particularly emphasize, as his father and mother describe it, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
“Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today.”
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents in June on a train will be convicted under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC reported.
The Ministry of Defence man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train bound for Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of people from Whitehall.
"They may have thought that this case would have remained within the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating Section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the tutelage of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Secret Service Committee.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies in front of the B&B bill.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million to cover the Bradford & Bingley Bank bailout.
The Government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that raise money from savers, including 59 building companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it was “irritating” to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will increase at the same time, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It's annoying to see that institutions that have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the institutions' bills that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will rise to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to settle the interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the trade committee of building companies, told the BBC that the decision seemed unfair to him.
It’s “irritating” to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously during the housing market recovery now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
“We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to adopt to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salty bill,” Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, we will have to pay the interest for the whole year, which could more than double.
Since construction companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennies per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk, from five pennies per litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, and comes as a result of research by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide if they will in turn increase the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last changed in 2002.
Former Bangladeshi PM denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is in danger of being arrested on her return home.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her indictment for extorting 50 million Taka ($729,000) from a businessman when she was a PM.
This case is one of many accusations against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country’s provisional military government first give it its full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free on her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s order.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s claim that it does not require bail since she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
“We will appeal against the Supreme Court’s order.”
Her lawyers argued that she needed the bail to return to the country to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former leader of the Awami party said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June to seek treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the accusations against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children missed the recent polio immunization campaign because of Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
The United Nations last week carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she says she is unable to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located to the south.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV court battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its stake in its rival transmitter ITV.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission stated that MSkyB’s participation in the past had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to actually prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Bureau of Fair Trading reported that the purchase by BSkyB of shares in ITV cast doubt on the effective independence of ITV, thereby prompting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin CEO Richard Branson, a consumer group, and regulator Ofcom were all opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB responded that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially given that BSkyB has just waived its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutors case.
The U.S. attorney general has appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole thing was born out of the account of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Accuser Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officers interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators, obstructing justice.
“Serious charges of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the removal in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed for poor benefits.
But it then emerged that dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to attribute the dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others have reportedly refused to investigate fraudulent voting charges against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of Department of Justice ministerial officers also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his leadership role, "remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic must be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf is due to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honoured" to get that recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 album hit.
The evening of the awards ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly does belong to them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, ranking 15th.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained in the English charts for nine years, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf – or Marvin Lee Aday, his real name – has suffered from a health problem in recent years, even undergoing surgery to cure his heartbeat that became irregular, after collapsing onstage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in his vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Soon Be For Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents do not know how to give directions to get to Extra Place, as they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street – not to be confused with Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Approximately 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty driveway rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repaver Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and boutiques, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, have said they are charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a neighborhood owner committee meeting, representatives from city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the real estate developer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
“There are only a few spaces left that belong to the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place,” she said.
“They could propose to rehabilitate and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repaint the small street and install seats, some of which would be used by a cafe to which the manufacturer would grant the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that while the company wants to operate the street, that doesn't necessarily mean it wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary interest is to remake this abandoned driveway, and make it public,” she said, noting that it was the city that suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokeswoman for Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing further that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named after it since 1802, when the legacy of Philip Minthorne’s many children’s large farm was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The back entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
"This place was beautiful," said Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scrap, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had previously talked about the East Village’s evolution towards luxury, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place a real rarity—a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be screwed up in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and shutters, full of newspapers from last week flying along the gutters."
With a few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs nimbly down the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the seat of a fancy clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce beer bottle, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passers-by said they rarely think about Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Field, for his part, said he thought some underestimated the appeal of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “have taken place in dark, wet and disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of California Studies, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not As Good As You Thought. Why the Middle Class Must Be Able to Choose Their School."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama’s campaign points out that “Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program supports, among many other topics, “bilingual transitional education” for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that advocates classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in East Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, made up of many newcomers, study English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% passed the 2008 state math exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students took the English-language-arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, a constant assessment of capabilities as well as an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, this school has instituted "full immersion" English language instruction.
Full immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Ms. Mikels, opposed to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying him."
“It works,” she observes, “it worked for us.”
Shouldn’t Mr. Obama take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English?
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama’s response.
While he is supportive of the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
“On the contrary,” he said, “you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than disdaining them or considering them insignificant.
The net fall of oil following the new concerns of the world of the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people fear that the bailout in favor of financial markets will bring the economy back to life.
Crude oil futures operations fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange during this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by Wall Street’s financial turmoil, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After seeing an increase of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices dropped to nearly $90 a barrel this month, before rebounding again in the face of deep financial market uncertainties.
Investors are once again worried on Monday despite the agreement on the bailout plan, the largest in history, reached this weekend by congressional leaders.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, Citygroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said this week’s frenetic negotiations, concluded with the bailout agreement, “seem to have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow down.
“The prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchanges has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally, and in particular, to China.”
Analysts at the bank have lowered their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, so they were forced to cut oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20 percent.
The party of the Second Time Determinant for the Improvement of the Record of the Team.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets’ Shaun Ellis uniform, the defender thought he had seen it all.
He was watching the second half, when the Jets turned a 0-0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played dirty under dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor to an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from the half.
"I didn't leave my zone," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a mediocre player"
“We communicated extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing wrestling, the defense was beating Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, cornerback, intercepted a missed shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith took another pass and intercepted her.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
The last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking a 34-0 lead.
It was the best the Jets could have scored in a while.
“Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said, ‘Second half or third?’
When he was told the two- the Jets passed 21 undisputed points in the third half- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpasses his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian, once again proved to be worthy of his title as the best cross-country runner of the century, after beating his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a 2:03:59 victory in an accommodating race on the flat, Gebrselassie beat his 2:04:26 record last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing – perhaps exaggerated in today’s eyes – that air pollution would increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees to start, 55 to finish- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track riders like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to cross-country runners, have contributed to the marathon’s record drop of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, he had suffered from calf cramps two weeks earlier, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went well."
He has been blamed – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s African rival – for having over-orchestrated his races, avoiding world marathon stars, actually relying on hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a cross-country runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
A little over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by five minutes.
Kamathis finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving on her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skillful strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a great advantage, then surpassing them about 1 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a Shared City, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first all-black town to incorporate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make today." The city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison."
It has now become a pilgrimage city.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in a variety of ways, the city she describes—became touristic thanks to its inclusion in The Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project’s Florida Travel Guide—remains a place of its own.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the rural black population of Florida was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who “knows us so little, doesn’t know what he’s losing.”
Even if it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious from the outside.
“We’re very careful about how to tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a longtime resident and the city’s oldest parishioner.
"It has to be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover as well as a community of almost 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture - sometimes disdained, sometimes acclaimed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
Interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through sincere, dialect-filled books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a road that runs through the often-forgotten center of Florida that leads to the chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a big punch in life as in literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
"Passed the road on the left," she writes, "you'll find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve people passing by.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn’t a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's young girls that Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, aboard a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many made fun of her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he adds, swaying in his chair from the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy she gave to the world,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a 2003 biography of Hurston.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Officials in Orange County wanted to move a five-lane highway into town, replacing Kennedy Boulevard, the community's two-lane main street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mixing of races led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"At that time, a band of young whites came to throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"A lady has even died."
They threw a watermelon out of their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education as “insulting rather than glorifying of my race.”
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
“Black children used to be kissed—I remember well—they kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Eatonville Community Safeguards, a nonprofit group.
It lasted, she added, until the time when teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white teacher because he’s white – I mean there’s a cultural demarcation line here,” Nathiri said.
Civil rights, by the way, have created space for many more Zora Neale Hurston—black writers, actors, and artists who have gone beyond prejudice, such as herself, armed with joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as, "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began to struggle to revive his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, reintroduced it to American guns.
The highway project came just as Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county pushed back the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summed it up by declaring that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has attended our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents were beginning to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A mono-theme library (of course Hurston) opened in 2006 on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(There are now 90 percent blacks.)
Strangers who come to discover the story of Eatonville, its raison d'<0xC3><0xAA>tre, are still treated with caution.
Permission must be sought for most interviews, and certain things—such as the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the fields—should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous teacher with a keen eye for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, not better or worse, but also proud, creative, busy, crazy and mixed up than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like Alondra and 11-year-old Alexia Kenon, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
“Most people who pass by in that area will think, ‘Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’” Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone is fluent in finance.
In spite of everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they’re in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and honeycomb desks above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, are spending the worst “office work day” since the crack of 1929.
Delivery workers continue to sneak onto the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
The Latinos still hang between the residential buildings wearing, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke laid on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to line up to buy their morning sandwiches from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, as I was discovering at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people queuing.
Not in front of the cashiers' desks, not to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service desk, where regular customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists asked for direction for the Macy's store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my “authorized personal banker,” were all queuing for the same reason I was.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a construction company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and that claim to treat customers like their families.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327-capital bank, has turned to the bankruptcy trustee, and as New Yorkers returned home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the store employees in front of me, frightened of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems to them reliable, the one that does the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its meager CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take risks.”
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, are taking part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating red-striped mosques.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to police, an organized action.
The delinquents painted on several graves Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; detectives believe, however, that this could have been done to disguise the hatred of extremists towards Muslim immigrants.
This incident could somehow be related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said it was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of the desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan which is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously considering regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that garnered nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, led his campaign against wearing scarves and burkas, and even voiced his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the rise of Islam.
The two parties tried to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, have defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from traveling abroad.
The courts have banned the glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he had expressed to the authorities who controlled him his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Kent Police issued the travel ban on Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse to the magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in Ashford's limited jurisdiction courts, but was nevertheless represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the court said: "On Thursday, September 25, in the Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until March 25.
“Paul Gadd wasn’t there.”
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if he was registered on the lists of those accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss specific cases or Glitter’s potential trips to the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: "The Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
According to us, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have devices that are able to manage any potential risks, much more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the most cherished intention of the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize the potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he was supposed to board for a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and he was therefore forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Court of Limited Jurisdiction, West London, for registration on the list of persons charged with sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the UK for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the Interior Ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister was reassured and happy to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off the stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments unknown to the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen looks of artists who do not care to get on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the program of Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists able to transmit on stage passion, sadness, joy ... captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you do not have to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and character of their own.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera moments of personality of flamenco stars.”
With the festival "Song of the Mines", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, recall classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and that surprises every day".
It is not about the dance or the song itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essential and magic was the constant of this work that is presented these days at the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has been transformed into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, get to know them and be able to enter their lives for a more or less long moment.
I think in photography portraiture is the hardest genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that you sometimes don’t know or who only give you a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that is entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, located at number 20 of rue de la Mata (street parallel to the People of Hercules) which will be open until October 16 next.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he writes is "real daring"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and who has gone through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize-winning literary favorite confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies him "is a real audacity" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people march in the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with a majority of the participants’ votes, filled the stage at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The Festival's presenter, Félix Romeo, found himself in front of a fascinated and fascinated audience who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humour, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote a novel about his work.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes them less like" people, because they were asked to "fly away from the writers."
Bad weather spoils the Pozoblanco fair
The flag party that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse-riding toreadors checked that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather hit this fair hard, since in the end two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race planned.
On the bill were José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was worn in triumph, having made arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the uncovered stands applauded more than his fight in himself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a significantly better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five o'clock or ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of the Basque Country (Ertzaintza) on the border of the Municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two undertake the flight.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information released by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Traffic Unit of the Alava were carrying out a vehicle control on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and the check began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the side, where the two occupants descended to flee to a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bales and was then transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, officials found that the license plate had been "falsified" since it did not match the one written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with a crime of falsification of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The inmate, 28-year-old A. A. J., was placed in custody for the various procedures and will be tried within hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving on Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her doing strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesman for the California police patrol revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "tucked the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she drove on her sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why officers took her to the drug and alcohol center to conduct a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first glance, we thought that Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear walked out of the Arizona clinic where she was being treated for a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares has asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation that makes a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing favor treatments to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the behavior of the political party that he will have to adopt within the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left demanded that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has “very strict ethical codes for all civil servants.”
" Sangre de Mayo", Garci's daring bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with almost 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film, "Sangre de mayo" will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a more than four-hour TV series for Telemadrid.
A great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s's literature, José Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD> assures that he realized with this film "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a film commemorating the two hundredth anniversary of the 2nd of May in Madrid, something he always accepted when the narrative was based on national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothes the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been mistaken as leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding like for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "Ghosts of Goya" - more than double the one obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom he collaborated for almost his entire career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a commencere" has influenced his usual way of working, the staging of the actors, with whom he is accustomed to rehearsing before starting filming and to whom he does not cast, since it seems "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and to the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de mayo", "Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner, "The blind sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known", he said.
With this movie Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you work for posterity, then you realize you work only for prosperity, and now you just make an extra film,” Garci says after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n takes on the role of the Seville dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A dancer from Seville will pay tribute to a dancer from Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to play the Sevillan dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The songs of his dances reminded me of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers,” she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with her who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me.”
The staging was also thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, El Pulga y Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; to the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as to the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, "who played the role of the eternal genre of this artist".
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of this woman who exhibited in places so far away, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think it is these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows or highlights her work,” says Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The show will start at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennate
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Recently Married Poet" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennate of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" in 2008.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: This poplar of light" that was inaugurated last May and that, after traveling in the different provinces of the International Andalusian during New York, will go to
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America Likes It Less Without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malice," and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
He hasn’t toured since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better because of his existence.”
No one was afraid to make themselves ridiculous or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland has died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are frightened, the esteem of Americans has fallen very low, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and with no reason to live, all that remains for human beings is admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the anti-drug foundation created in honor of his eldest deceased following an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, has found that no James Bond has died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the height of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He set the bar high for us,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from the goals.
It’s still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal even though the opportunities were not lacking for him not to be so.
“But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house if I have a steak in my fridge?” he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
“Among all the great roles he’s played, he’s never been as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring, philanthropic grandfather,” he said.
Madrid in the race to organize the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid could organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could be realized in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday’s race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I have ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would have been the subject of a knockout score.
But let’s look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of bibs, which forces you to go there early.
This is not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small size jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which there were rebellions and assaults of the barracks.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which, I think, did not properly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, this one would not come to mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At MIT's Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft was presented with a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) in response to what was asked during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listen and hear the keywords of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and she tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Awesome.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essentials instead of useless applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
Change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome came to the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Many people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary since it is the indispensable basis for the computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It occupies the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear but we must see the “death” of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who uses half of the applications that come with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer apps, much less than Vista.
Less heavier, cluttered month, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of Microsoft’s employee rest rooms in Redmond.
On the beverage dispenser, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week there was a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, is more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endorsed it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the holding of the Muscle Gay Association.
And if we start to enumerate all his appearances, we could also mention this sturdy moustache who was lifting weights in a traveling circus.
It's not just a simple cotton men's body jersey, molded and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex cut, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag ( barely recognizable) that the most famous body jerseys have on the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, baby girls, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Although it is a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
His resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion prices that the Spanish company sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but at the same time exciting day awaits us.
What is the basis of your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we are very inspired by it for our collections.
I really like to walk around town and observe women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you are a very versatile woman: isn’t it?
I think so, but ultimately it all comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a child, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to look in my aunt’s closets and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers love to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you put on the clothes, that's when you really put yourself in the character's shoes.
So everything is connected.
It wasn't long ago, 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30th birthday makes me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me to, and moreover, I want to become a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give a lot of happiness to my son and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to get out.
I am a woman from the theater, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can't wait for the movies 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ' to be released.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the catwalk to be a model.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in a charity parade in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we exhibited – I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango – were auctioned off to raise money for Naomi’s NGO.
People that Naomi is a tender-hearted person.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things are not true.
Besides, that good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for third world women.
Recidivists of alcohol at the wheel will have to install the system 'alcolock'
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle in a state of drunkenness, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced in June last year and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety but also the General Directorate of Road Safety and the Foundation Technological Institute for Automotive Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once intoxicated, take the car back.
The alcoholock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than the allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is at the expense of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced offences by up to 65% in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, the reform done by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
Mexico without peep-toes
At 17:40, official scheduled time, the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar of Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez airport of Mexico City.
The sun was on the eve of sunset but its rays still forced to put his hand as a visor to be able to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official journey.
- Ah, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... Are you from here or so...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row of 27 naval soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when to her, has hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual peep-toes; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing into the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican TV reporter awaits them.
The most prestigious award in fashion
There is surely no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is surely no living cartoonist more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she was almost crying with emotion.
It is certainly the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the contest, made that we found ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the table next to that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
With a heavy heart and a good heart against bad luck, due to the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a Mango garment and some breath-taking ELAH ornaments, and arms over them, arms under with her son Luis – a handsome man almost two meters tall – she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rotchil ended the evening without a coat because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store wearing pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner transformed herself by wearing a long sexy and black dress, was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the rehearsal room of the ballets and remembering the good old days.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the outbuildings of the palace, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez – another handsome man who travels by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked that there be no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the antistress number
There are not just 1000 but 1001 ways to forget about the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to booksellers on September 30.
The wake-up call almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse when we think of the hectic pace that current life imposes on us.
The desk is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is titled '1001 Ways to Relax' and will arrive at booksellers directly from publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If the adrenaline doesn’t run through your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep that is called somniloquia.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely there are more than one who talk during the night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful situations or overexcitement.
In any case, this is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak in a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with screams, weeping, long speeches...
In the event that somniloquy becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
As soon as the somniloquies appear try to remain calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless since he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is unusual), don’t be tempted to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because while sleeping, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you will interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to find out his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, do not worry, this is nothing bad, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory on his field after a long period of famine.
Without making a big match, the Yellows and Blacks created the most opportunities and managed to turn one for the win of the match.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by visiting captain Kauffmann, who was nearing the skylight with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascendant slightly and turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Romain from the tip of the foot or Diebold came to tickle Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we were blocking in the middle of the field and we just left the Riahi stirrer at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illousiens by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illousiens scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose big problems to an Illustrious Eleven who has just stepped back a little to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of the game where, after a big scramble, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of fishermen who on Monday severely disrupted the access of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the soaring prices of diesel, which has reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to the spokesman of the Elysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing closures of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not stopped.
A filtering dam has been set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of fuel depots in the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Channel coasts, such as Les Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where trawlers remained docked, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
At the Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday what follow-up to give to the movement and its participation in the interview planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let anything go" and "do not want to move to Paris", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the president of the fisheries committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a diesel below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes hailed the film legend and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession looming over the global economy.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is maintaining its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market especially for its planes in the range from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which U.S. monetary authorities have bailed out, is planning to divest more than 15 percent of its assets to repay the $85 billion it was offered, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its businesses beyond its international life insurance and retirement business in the United States, the paper said, citing sources familiar with the matter.
AIG's board of directors met Sunday evening to discuss possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to divest include its aerial leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings and its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity.
No final decision has been taken on these divestitures, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly raise cash to repay the Federal Reserve’s $85 billion loan at the risk of U.S. authorities taking 80 percent of its capital, diluting current shareholders.
Analysis Paris Morning Meeting session history Morning Meeting session history
The New York Stock Exchange posted a historic slump on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bailout plan: the Dow lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the bank bailout plan that was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“It shows how much the market was counting on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would arrive “too late.”
“If the project is indeed dying ... then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the downfall of a financial institution" in the United States, stressed Ms. Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the buyout of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, pushing for emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not only an American crisis, but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday evening, and the return on the 30-year treasury bond to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% the day before.
Obama, winner in the points of the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two White House candidates was followed by another to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, while honorable, was not “brilliant enough” to allow him to halt his decline in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), says the Democrat pulled his pin from the game.
Among undecided voters, who are the ones who matter, Obama was the winner for 39% of those polled, while 25% of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his rival, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts,” Clinton said this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his undisputed foreign policy experience, while underscoring his opponent's "naiveness" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that ...” he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican TV commercials.
Obama said it represented the future.
Without dismantling himself, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still hasn't understood, while Obama has," a Democratic spot retorted this weekend, accusing the Republican of not taking full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American on the street."
"During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina.
He hasn't even uttered the words "middle class" or "workers."" The financial failure clearly benefits Obama, who is seen by Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the brink.
“The coming week could be a turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
“The current debacle is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would still be able to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans despite the upheavals on Wall Street, the Illinois senator also pointed out that achieving possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, the two candidates dodged questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as polling stations in central Minsk square closed to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit not even voting: "What good, since they will do what they want with my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good name for foreign observers with the aim of resuming their language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections were seen as proper by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the counting," said Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexander Milinkievitch, a former candidate of the 2006 presidential opposition and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is the voices, and in our country it is the executive power.
If opposition deputies enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
She points out that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
“Have you noticed that there was an election, you?” asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be at most five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night falls back on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, he regained the public confidence that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and the grumbling of the public, in February 1994 the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, which sought to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gelineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Services to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began operations, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was daunting.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field in the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were seen in Europe, says the one that has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports was that when this is not known and a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, blood was denied to people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Now, a few years ago, it was shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which allow the presence of the virus itself to be directly detected in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs shortened the mute period, which stretches from the time the person was infected to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk of certain donors becoming infected unknowingly and not being able to be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says the CEO of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide a sufficient supply.
“The needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a refill of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has an impact on the blood donor network, which on average only includes 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.
Anyone who is 18 years of age or older who meets the eligibility criteria can still donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country with malaria, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to withhold them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today’s life is so unbridled, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the banking of our 1,000th cord blood sample and are planning to take more than 1,000 a year.
We should start offering them for transplants early next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL first division playoffs with a 3-1 (4-3 goals in total) win over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive quarter-final game of the series in total goals at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets of the Montreal team.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first round of the series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will compete against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still made it to the 5-4 semifinal round in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Victorious goal of Kovalev
The Canadian’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian in the barrage shots against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in that win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to do too much in the first half," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation.”
Charest bet on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out triggering elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council was over, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), was trying to get elected in today's by-election.
"Reaching the limits of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the main lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of image mill.
Spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc. were filmed in a loop, on three huge screens.
Great means as in the election period.
At a press briefing, the prime minister declined to rule out that he would trigger elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labor agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, forestry, but especially the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it is at home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it at home, but it is in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the press briefing.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government,” he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open year-round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Péquiste MP for Ungava), have already begun consultations with about thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment where "we will give each other a common vision".
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan North will be “concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of Liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the Liberals before us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed the renaming of the Beauharnois power station as the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has forged the future," said Jean Charest.
As a press point, he invoked another conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"It stays between us there, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, arousing applause in their homes.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He points out that his schedule is, however, filled, notably by a mission of the council of the federation in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that have passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular demands recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they would have the right to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the main lines of the Plan Nord were met with skepticism.
The Chief Péquist, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If he had done so, "we would have been more advanced today" commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (election that is taking place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supports the government's adoption of a Plan North.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said Sébastien Proulx, who replaces Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (o irony) in the Harper cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To cast a disgrace on this woman who has fought an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
We are faced with a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national imprisoned in the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts he is accused of.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier crumble in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Recall, for the record, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can enjoy a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it doesn’t care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We don’t realize it yet, but we are now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” a word that Harper keeps wielding and which sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morality: one can arbitrarily mismanage, torture, imprison a Canadian citizen according to the will of a head of government hitherto a minority (what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a defamation lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the penny in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally conducted through the exchange of ideas and not by batons.
So it was enough for the mine to open its books, its files and to establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust the public and rejects the petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both demand a "public" debate while scorning the opinions of that same public?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word refers only to high-paying lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak out.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because they reject the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a gag prosecution (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a formal notice with the authors of Black Canada urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Garver’s surreal discourse, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to citation from credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are displeasing to the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under pain of repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long known how to deal with debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for academia, as it is for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
It includes: better control by the elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to the managers of the companies rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Rep. at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything was done in a way that protected the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“That’s the bottom line: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense,” Rep. Judd Gregg said.
Negotiations had turned to the sprint in recent hours for fear of the effect of a further failure on the mood of investors.
The time limit we agreed on was the opening of markets this morning.
Associated late in the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election showed themselves quite supportive of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their dissatisfaction that we were forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama credited himself with adding some provisions to the deal, including allowing homeowners to keep their homes and the salary of executives at state-run businesses.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no reason to welcome them.
But these measures are necessary," he said on U.S. television.
Asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The broad lines I’ve read [show] that it’s something we’re all going to have to digest and with which we’re going to be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to redeem with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unsellable assets of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprimes) before expanding to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and the rout of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of elected Republicans who overturned the first draft agreement last week.
We are believed to have come out of this impasse since Democrats accepted that some “toxic” assets of struggling companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to round the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to bear losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its bet.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of $250 billion to which an additional $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion should be endorsed by another Congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the companies it rescues, which will earn dividends in case of profit and which it can resell when the turmoil has passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay foreclosure procedures for dwellings attached to real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on compensation and severance pay to managers of affected businesses.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Indeed, votes continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
“Obviously, Washington is not listening to you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House finance committee, told voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
It’s not about benefiting taxpayers.”
Host of a small group in Congress dubbed “the caucus of skeptics,” Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel Prize laureates, have written to us to tell us: Congress is asked not to hurry and to carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was renouncing to acquire its competitor in full sinking since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of risky mortgages in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, a voting right in the bank and influence is regained.
This is precisely something that savers and households appreciate now that the times are uncertain."
Meanwhile, across the English Channel, the British government seemed on track to nationalize another bank battered by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time his asset card, some will say his weakness.
Did he free himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
What a great cross-country runner!
Paul Newman, who passed away on Friday from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch at age 83, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the good years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian-born mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate quality brand.
For in him was projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the Pacific War fighter, wounded in battle, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, on television, soon in cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, dubbed a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadow areas of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the bursts of show-business, of which we will not have completely pierced the riddle.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has made moviegoers dizzy this weekend, as his big roles on the black screen of memories collide.
More than half a century of an ever-changing seventh American art is passing through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Pussy on a Burning Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we talk about his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano in Robert Wise’s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, reprised after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliant The Sting (The Scam), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter billiards player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar out of nine nominations.
That face through the ages was him.
He's back.
The times are rushing through its path.
Young people know him most through George Roy Hill's cult-like Slap Shot (1977) as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the patron of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes’ Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against the backdrop of several film legends who abandoned the profession early enough, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendours and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humour, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" considering its performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles fell long and hard in the beak.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginalized: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect features reflected drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true pudic sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, traced a fine female portrait of melancholy.
The man who lost his son Scott to an overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Amid the rain of tributes yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of Hollywood drifts also disappears.
We will have seen a lot of his goodness throne on pots of dressing, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, although gag at first.
The proceeds from these sales were nevertheless donated to his Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: “Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in short and in addition.
What could Zuschlag & Company do in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearings related to the ongoing criminal proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, which has resulted in particularly significant damage. Other charges have been held against them, such as forgery and the use of forgeries.
According to the prosecutor's office, money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand into the caisses of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand, into the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive the money from the grants obtained by issuing cost invoices, behind which no real benefits were provided and thus, the associations never fulfilled their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the bills were false.
For the latter, they procured invoice books at the market of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros, while they manufactured the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados, at the request of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to locate pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they were going to introduce, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for writing the files necessary to obtain the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, which would later bear the name Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, was riddled with errors of form and substance.
A boarding house, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there, yet the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty guests.
The issuers of imaginative invoices also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért nor that of the Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor's office.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor's office summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"Our company name and tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, a hundred people had lodged there, did not stick either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices also did not inquire about Budapest travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but only organize trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which is also contrary to the accounting practices of the agency.
In addition, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the services related to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp at the order of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, the hotel's employees only issue printed invoices, while the false ones were handwritten.
The public prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes in mentioning as a service the transport of goods by road, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it is also for defects of form, such as types of inadequate invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt to Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredéret Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, of XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyesület and of Biztos Pont have proved to be false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> sports internship, both deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The forgers also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) when the group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at their house. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Deliberately Established Invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is those who were fully aware that they were required to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, has drawn up an invoice to the order of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the order of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, the association Atlasz Egyesület behind which no benefit was actually provided Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület, for an amount of about five million HUF.
There was no financial movement, either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies did not mention this in their accounts.
The next category of invoice-issuing companies is the companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the general manager of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., dealing with the fuel and motor vehicle trade, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, for an amount of approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. de Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov also reportedly sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
From what we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of the companies Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezrédért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, and that he pocketed their counter-value.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies were operating, which the accused explains by the fact that they did not receive work.
At the request of Mr Zsolt Szente, co-defendant and author of the founding acts of the companies, he drew up invoices in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>.
Kubatov donated 15 invoices issued by Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to organizations for a total value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutors thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices that were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért applied for a grant from the Socialist Party's public utility T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny (TMA).
They obtained this subsidy in the amount of HUF 500,000 twice, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from becoming known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, it is these invoices that were found during the search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will discuss the method of making the invoices, as they had done before the prosecution.
What could be really interesting would be that the main defendant, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or whether, eventually, the Socialists would have reached an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since requests for his placement under house arrest, based on a easing of his conditions of detention, continually fall into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more damage, and the perpetrators of unrepairable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings.
The Psychology of Overbidding: Why Do We Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at New York University have managed to update the neurological and economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research attempted to draw up a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers was playing the lottery, while the other group was participating in a fun auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, the researchers were analyzing the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants were able to win money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the overbidding of a third, the set under the brain stem, called the striatum, was set in motion intensively when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the “self-stimulation” mechanism of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight in front of the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists in this group of researchers carried out financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups were outbid against a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and thus they made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
While the third group received that $15 before the auction, the group members also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed in one on victory, while in the other, on failure.
Proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the "against failure" team were willing to bet higher than those made by the control group and the "for victory" group.
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
“Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should we see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
There are an estimated one hundred thousand people with the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles are being treated, due to the fact that the patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended to get vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated foods, usually accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach upset and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stools become lighter and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Across the world, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause of this is that, according to estimates, only one patient in ten receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not known to have the virus, because the pathogenic gene sneakily destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms do not appear until after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who have had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from around the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to chronic cirrhosis of the liver, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does one who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article claiming that researchers at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing how belief in God could influence human pain tolerance.
As part of this bizarre experiment, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Through a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More precisely, the experiment takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing the electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a sort of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not much different from the first, was about its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking at either religious-themed painting or more general-themed painting.
Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe", like someone they "cared for" and they "calmed down, and peace invaded them".
At the sight of religious-themed painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that one can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided they find the appropriate photo.
“We should find an image that they react very positively to, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of this research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases, it actually changes our personality,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if we showed the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the sight of a better Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you divulge about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found in the bottom of people's pockets just like the sky above their heads. It knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what their interests are.
Yet it is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While with regard to the skeptics drawing a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users, which is necessary for Google's founders to meet their original goal of "Let's collect all the information in the world in one system!"
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of work of global upheaval, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
Schmidt responded that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What's the best job for me?" However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, when they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages visited by the interested parties are precisely listed.
Through the program Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have searched for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, long-term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized responses, and will submit us products and services based on our previous statements.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can arouse a counter-reaction among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the search terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are passed on to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most resounding example in recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human rights-conscious Internet users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm in arm with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right in court before the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will still not be forced by any of the constitutional points to disclose information about the FBI’s secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier. But in the end, it fails to obtain the lists of private users' searches, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its “wildlings” bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big companies, the “connected corporation”, as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as invading the world because of Windows, and this, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and the program package, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what the web 2.0, the most widely proclaimed keyword in recent years, draws precisely behind it.
In fact, web 2.0 is about nothing other than collaboration, only the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels put at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential thing remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link these to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, in which they appear on their most recent blogs.
While we can read many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at the sight of the morning pictures, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that has totally fired one of its employees, just for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management's life, we can be
The person who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how we can define the principle behind the behavior of today's young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to bypass Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. The services of Google online, from word processing to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge fleets of servers, and that do not assemble
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion).AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while services introduced at an increasing speed cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all this, contradictions with disturbing effects: for example, the Chinese top management of the company has rejected, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it has doubled the price of the corporate kindergarten and after the company has deemed too expensive the multiple daily restoration, taken at any time.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are not announced until they can be used. What's certain is that in the next few months and years, they will build the medical system on new points. While some may think that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines takes on such important dimensions that the company will soon find itself in front of the United States.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors.The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian halftones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way just through Google data.
Two miners helped remove traces of <0xC3><0x93>zd’s double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd. Based on well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the Borsod department police station.
The young people have acknowledged the facts they are accused of, for the moment, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
Murder complicity can result in detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt and it is for this reason that he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him, as well as the young daughter of this man, 9 years old.
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden at the crime scene is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, to buy back 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to secede from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech business daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid so far for the buyout of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new less good owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could result in the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by market experts to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech kroner.
Based on an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with around 25 percent holdings, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In Tuesday's comments on the international financial crisis, which is getting worse every day, leading European newspapers are already talking about a "second 9/11".
"The global financial catastrophe, we owe it to the American president" - accuses the daily in Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a hurry, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett once said, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing every day, and then the whole world will pay the heavy price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, a real danger threatens, one that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the void, just at the moment when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer, says the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states may still lend a lifeline to their hesitant financial institutions, and thanks to their taxpayers’ money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will suffice.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to ignore their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Viennese daily Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent.
The "saviors" must not immediately brandish a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The smart car mimics the theft of the buzzer
What better method would be to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle than the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
Like, for example, the bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees gave the Nissan engineers the strategic idea to start, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired BR23C self-controlled robot system, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval in shape, which in reality looks a lot like our secure protective shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development and technological public relations department of the brand.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a crucial role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, assesses the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which transforms it into an avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
“If this were not the case, the mini auto robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid the other bees.
The process should take place in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that the bees have to avoid the other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotary movement, acceleration as well as the slowdown as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot
The BR23C uses polymer lithium batteries that are lighter and have a larger energy concentrate, which makes their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store it.
This mechanism should only process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of memory continuously.
There is no need for memory with a capacity of gigabytes, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards designing a technology for instantaneous avoidance, which Nissan estimates will enter mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles in the way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at redeeming the dubious loans of banks, and to use in multiple instances, is ready.
In the first round, half of that amount will be spent.
Reuters reports that in the course of further debates extending into late midnight on Saturday, local East Coast time, congressional leaders have come to an agreement on the controversies that have been going on for days and days, around the $700 billion bailout plan.
“We’ve taken a serious step forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who says it’s time to put the deals on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of rescuing Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. local Washington time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., depending on local Central European time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill for the emergency economic stabilization bill of the year 2008. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also hailed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the advances made tonight, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
Moreover, the program differs from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which mentioned that the $700 billion should be spent in one go, for the redemption of securities on dubious credits.
From now on, no more than half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after Congress passes the law, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to purchase dubious debts from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the chairman of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: it will be able, at the same time, to purchase dubious debts, securities relating to dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" debts.
The department's competent persons stated that the purchases can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that give rise to the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary tools to allocate $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the financial system, whether that be the extensive redemption of bad debts, their insurance, or the avoidance of the risk of the system leading to the collapse of one or the other major financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for law enforcement, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank executives in poor positions awaiting state aid can expect their severance pay, simply called a golden parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
Salary caps are mentioned only in specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers assistance to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys back as part of an auction, they will levy a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the redemption of the dubious receivables, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it should still be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap applies only to new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in U.S. history that legal caps will be in place for directors-general’s salaries,” said House Financial Benefits Committee Chairman Barney Frank.
In addition, the state obtains a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, in this way the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they can even win in the case as soon as the economy and with it the rescued banks fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that within the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will decide on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, starting with the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why the U.S. citizens mandated us, it doesn’t protect taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
Ohio Democrat Mary Kaptur thinks it's the same people who are pushing for action that are responsible for the Wall Street collapse.

The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemicals and products manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery and equipment manufacturing (0.9 per cent), and a minimal increase in wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry saw an increase, between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, representing a significant weight in domestic industrial exploitation, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices implemented by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales of processing sectors, prices in the oil processing sector experienced the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, price increases of 13.2 per cent were observed, while in the major food, beverage and tobacco production sector, prices increased by 11 per cent.

Export sales prices in the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, while they suffered a decrease of 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our domestic means of payment weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro and 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Will you still need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that by 12 January, the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
“Now, everything depends only on when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into operation.”
At all times, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in talks starting today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisors of the presidential candidates, the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support bailout plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major US parties, assured their support for the government’s $700 billion bailout plan, however, there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of the US Secretary of the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they had reached agreements in principle on the plan to rescue the banks.
This funding plan, which aims to thaw the Wall Street crisis and the crippled credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as better than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has once again managed to get a little bit of a head start, and McCain's lead, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a fighter just after the Republican convention, has melted away.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the bill on the $700 billion bailout plan.
He stressed that the proposal contains the passages of consumer protection that he also supports.
"Now is the time to act responsibly ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain’s economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We'll all have a hard time swallowing it ... but doing nothing is not a possible path."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal mentioned the creation of a Treasury Board and the cap on senior executive severance pay, and that he was, personally, very attached to those points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of the reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of epoch is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday, a process came to an end that was likely only ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU picked up 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the much talked about Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", set up in the region consistently by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace, but the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans from the north and east in the developing region of Bavaria could not remain without consequences for the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also astonishing that in recent weeks it has been precisely the groups of traditional citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as self-employed people, craftsmen, holders of the baccalaureate and graduates.
In these groups, support for CSU fell below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on the sidelines in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily newspaper deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that has settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SP<0xC3><0x96> want to talk with the conservatives of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from meddling in its internal affairs.
The populist BZ<0xC3><0x96> party is open to negotiations and the Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates organized on public television, party leaders have hardly let their maps glimpse.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wanted to talk with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he imagines a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann's part.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer guideline was, in any event, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or membership of the coalition is for the moment a very open question, and these points must absolutely be debated within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Jörg Haider, the president of BZ<0xC3><0x96>, is once again open to any proposals.
“To avoid the coalition of the reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: Breaking the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began in Paris as the representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary, as one of the main spokespersons for the expert consultation, L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is a violation of the law that affects Roma children most and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party group, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka warned that in addition to the distinctions observed during the hirings, the Roma disappear from the labor market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualification.
“The overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a very small number have the opportunity to obtain a post-graduate degree.”
In addition, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in asserting other fundamental rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children means a strengthening of the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma child starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By virtue of their European Union nationality, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from a low-quality and sectarian education." - underlined L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the MEP, a goal-oriented and action-oriented EU collaboration is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the school desegregation process, for which compliance with existing and in preparation anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and the democratic opportunities for Roma children must be given, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," said J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
In the name of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" for all, the aim of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe, held every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support the measures taken for equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination, aimed at the European level and at the level of the member countries.
CSU: grace for a transition period
It is in October that the decision will be taken on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite this unfortunate election failure, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed.
The party president Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still hold their place. The question is how long will the grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, in any case, made it feel that they were not particularly fond of their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the angry members of the fraction and the base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the peak of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was Bavaria’s “only sovereign” giving 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
But the Conservatives still count heavily in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into a coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, has also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates groping discussions with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along a possible right-wing values.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli enters into the legislation, whose action against Stroiber served as a possibility of a coup perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, and then treats the very ambitious female municipal politician without hesitation.
Now, CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing Beckstein in one way or another.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far been pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, has designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some bitter remarks to the CDU, which he said deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel can only be Chancellor again if they re-establish in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the CSU’s loss of ground will not negatively influence the Berlin grand coalition.
This is however relative because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democrats still lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MP has been elected to the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's election.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is explained by illegalities committed during the counting of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-person legislature in this country of 10 million people has been doing very well in opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition joining forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) had some serious hopes that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in the "constitutionally dubious"
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is economically dependent on Russia more and more, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the natural Belarusian political order called anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition.
The OSCE's assessment of the campaign's focus on positive changes rather than failures, such as a ban on one-third of opposition candidates, referred to prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE communiqué on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and especially the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and the Abbey separated from Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the candidate for the opposition in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains the case, despite the fact that "the power was afraid in this parliament, which has no weight, to bring in even a single opponent".
The opposition does not plan to protest in the light of the results; rather, it is trying to get its message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of worries on that side: we have to print our main newspapers opponents in Russia, the local authorities put us sticks in the wheels when it comes to broadcasting, but I can also see that they are really supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly" - said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current regime of the Luka no longer officially considers the
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is now only a matter of time," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in actions." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had there been any revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, is in force this new measure against the little cunning, against which points and will then drink the coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-laziness novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services," says the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
“This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from employees was registered, the secretary general said: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta’s promise, which suggests with a smile, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution.”
At a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration publique
“In three months, the absence of sickness of public employees has been reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more workers in a year.”
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more efficient.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined together to challenge the Brunetta Decree standards using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today spreads data on the decline in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness," the consumer association writes, "the people of the "active lazy" continue to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive employees of the Public Administration have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity due to service, the extension of the hours of the sick worker's housekeeping hours, during which the check-ups are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Workplace accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To get the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil is celebrating today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data released by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association of the Mutilated and Invalid of Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuous associative effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion"
Naturally indignant, everyone has struck a fist to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, arouse media clamour and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
For his part, House Speaker Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths is still impressive," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
“We do not want this ‘tendency to discount’ to actually translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
According to Mercandelli, more checks and inspections are needed, as well as more intervention on the training of workers, and this from school.
- He added - "that there is still a need to make an effort with regard to communication and public awareness.
"But above all, there needs to be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of labour" and the "drift of assistance towards which the system has been directed in recent years".
"The objective, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance - he added - so that the fate of the one who has an accident, must not depend on spontaneity or the expansion of the legislator "
MP3 player pointing fingers, they put hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a statement released in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific report - we read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than one hour per day and per week, risk permanent loss of hearing."
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” Kuneva said.
“According to scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public.
We also need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
Scientists confirm that there is good cause for concern, and that the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and other stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit this data by using solutions such as reducing noise exposure levels and duration.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the limits currently in force regarding the maximum noise level allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for extended periods risk permanent loss of hearing after 5 years.
This affects 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to send the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we finish, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will finalise the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - Alemanno wishes to stress - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which can be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No overlay of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March, it will have finished its tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June-announced the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of everyday life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper prospect, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens, and will be used to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "we need a draft strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city, to improve itself, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a spirit of unity, ".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but that will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean ".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to pass himself off as an independent wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the part of his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
“Obama is really greedy: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and they do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
Here emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves put the cross, on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent said: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with a kick in the buttocks.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
In the US, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of newspapers.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly tell information attachés to feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on assembling the newspapers, are a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we are to ensure that traditional journalism as it is perceived by the general public is not reduced significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism pervades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no problem seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are making a switch to the Internet, perceived by many as the "murderer" of newspapers.
The “economic pressure” journalists feel is increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using technology in the hope that it "does something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest hangover in American journalism lies between who runs newsrooms — that is, the directors — and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to the "safety of work".
Directors who expect to lose their jobs within three years are 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, we are going to 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or letting go.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10k per month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, passed a certain number of years.
But according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" throughout the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the proceeding of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had requested to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy under the Unipol-Bnl escalation investigation.
At his trial last week, he was granted house arrest and made a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be able to travel the route from the provincial city to a house in the capital.
According to the court, such trips (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion bailout plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms us by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the central and southern states.
The very soul that made itself felt despotically with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just one example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake foretells or already allows to take place: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena hatched for some time, so much so that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the double category sovereign-state, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that obviously have close relations with foreign countries, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of the question, or does not have much to say: the obvious evidence is provided by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, fails to decide on any common political line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all an affection of credits: when you go through a difficult period, only the states have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in place.
They also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance which the more recent economic developments tend to attribute to a factor quite linked to this element: territoriality.
. Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized in one fell swoop, that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with the rather unmaterial things, such as water.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but that are absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So he who is sovereign certainly has more cards than he who is not, that is to say, he who has the misfortune of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably called Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadows.
And moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership, feeds underground, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the "revolts" improvised electoral or else, in the changes of collective moods of the latter only recently, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the Great rebellion and the fall of the workers.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, are finding it increasingly difficult, which is not from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and potentially agitates in an undisturbed way.
In view of all this, to speak of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say well, keep your eyes wide open, this is not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have taken inspiration from the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that make it possible to ensure a perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it “is easily detached from the wall,” says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
WALKING ON WALLS? – “this material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair, which cleans itself of dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Drugs: Never with fruit juices.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital drugs, alter their absorption, amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, grapefruit and orange juice.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized as held responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, anti-stem and neurological drugs, up to toxic levels.
MEDICATIONS AT RISK- It was the Italian Agency for the drug itself, which had given the news in a newsletter dated two years, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger deriving from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink, if you take drugs such as, for example, Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT PAMPLEMOUS- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, said: "These findings are generally immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies who will need to change the information notes of the drugs if necessary.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the drugs you are taking, and, if something is not clear, do not be impressed, but clearly address the doctor or pharmacist," the expert stressed to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the Bush administration's solutions in economics and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article in the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked many controversies, and which was blamed on the economist for years, but which has now turned out to be accurate.
“I am surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive "disseminator", particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach ever more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work, carried out by voluntary developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various novelties: from the welcome screen, and the revised interface and became less austere, to others more important, such as the compatibility born for the latest operating system Apple Mac OS X, and the support for the new format ODF.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some features specific to some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic design module, maintaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that link the typical graph of the Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or text editor.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the worksheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on modifications, in the elaboration of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some of OpenOffice’s features to the web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they are expected to issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is added to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped at home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of gratuitousness can be a means to spread it in the homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office the suite tries the great challenge, already being able to count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for equivalent video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, like the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008, to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl’s test tubes are part of those carried out in recent weeks, by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo, was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, picking up the polka dot jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES IS QUESTIONING IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" reluctantly welcomed.
The New York Times has dedicated a long article debating the topic of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are both those with "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Lega Nord"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
not only.
Even the Lega's new legislature to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The Pope, as well as the President of the Republic, said: "Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
Student housing market is not in crisis
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the tenant union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that the families from which they come have to support - explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the high demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase has begun for them.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of breaches: free, unregistered contracts, no rent limit, sub-rents.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the tax are necessary to calm the prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from a minimum of 650 euros (Black Strip area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), we ask about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
One can save only if one moves away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina area, Centocell or similar.
In Naples, for a bed you need 300/400 euros, for a simple one, you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for a bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rents are often taken by extra-community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, cities eliminate historic halls.
Historical cinemas are closing in favour of Multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the great Italian urban centers, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-rooms, and the death of consumption of mono-rooms in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and full of memory, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of the way and so many emotions" observes the director of the Nuovo cinéma Paradiso, a film that offers Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and that told the story of the
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the halls of the main cities that have paid the most: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, the Roman Emilie leads with 82 lost mono cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should still guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation of credit in favor of traders: the previous debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Notable is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation thanks to the signing of a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote cinemas in historic centers and on the outskirts.
Among the regulations provided for, there are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking lots and in some parking lots.
"It is an initiative that I like," Giuseppe Tornatore observes "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna implementing other measures.
However, it is obvious that, to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me, has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, I turn to the other side so as not to see the signs blackened by dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the City Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
The magistrates of the anti-mafia Directorate of Calabria have made heavy accusations against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for external competition for a mafia association.
The controllers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous with the boss, already convicted for association of criminals of the mafia type, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense" write the prosecutors, both local administrations had expressed willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
“This would have allowed the clan to officially enter the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration,” the judges write.
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also a lot of politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest.
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, after which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and again because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the SVP at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He cried out in scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of manipulating the whole thing for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PM write, emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a better known group, close to the Piromalli, harmonizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born from the waves, now the big ones are launched.
This is a disproportionate deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the world’s major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources that giants like Chevron have set their eyes on, and are now trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmentalist authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity needs could be met by swell-of-sea operating systems.
This would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be the currents and the tides..
Colossi on the attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a real revolutionary step.
Two years on, more and more of these traditional energy companies are relying on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and it is assessing the possibilities of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the US Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the path of energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested to date, although their details are not known, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its infancy, because marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
“And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which causes the sludge to move up and down, is converted to hydraulic pressure from the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure rotates a turbine, which in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to shore through underwater cables.
At the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing energy for a shopping mall and parking lot using six underwater turbines from New York’s East River.
The movement of the water during the tides, rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electric Energy Research, deserves the potential of tides right now.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, invested $7.5 million in 2008 and expect investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
