The 35mm format is actually formatted, but still complex, the 36mm width is multiplied by the 24mm height.
The ratio of this pattern (revised to twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) so it is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS shot format) are equivalent to or very close to this aspect ratio.
