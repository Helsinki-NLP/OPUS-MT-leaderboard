Members of the Welsh Assembly were very concerned about 'being seen as a joke'.
Some even offered to change their name to MWPs (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This lift follows a plan to change the Assembly's name to the Parliament of Wales.
Politician-sponsored Assembly members are concerned that this may lead to cynicism.
One labor union member said his group had concerns that "the name would go in accordance with the terms Twp and Pwp".
To the reader who is outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means a thing.
One of the members of the Plaid Assembly said the whole group had agreed to "disapprove" and offered alternatives.
As for the Welsh Conservatives, he said his group was "very open" about changing the name, but thought this was only a brief transition from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English language of Yorkshire.
Commissioner of the Assembly, who is currently drafting a draft law on the change of name, said: "The final decision on any referendum will certainly affect all members."
According to the Welsh Government's Law 2017 section, the authority has been given to the Assembly of Wales to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the matter, which was widely supported by the Assembly's call for the Parliament of Wales.
In the name of the Assembly, the committee preferred the name of the Member of Parliament of Wales, or WMPs, but at the same time, the MWP was more voiced by the public than at public consultations.
Assembly members also offer other options, but getting unanimous support will be even more of a headache for Elin Jones, who is the chairman of the meeting, and is expected to draft the draft legislation on this change within the next few weeks.
This reform will include changes in the way the Assembly operates, the removal of Assembly membership rules, and the design of the Board of Directors.
Members of the Assembly will receive the final voting rights, which will be decided on the question of how they should be nominated for a debate on this legislation.
The Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name.
Citizens with voting rights will vote on Sunday to vote on whether they should change the country's name to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
Populous pops have been offering solutions to disputes that have accumulated for more than a decade with the Greek neighboring country of its own state, Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the names of its northern neighboring countries indicate its territory, and there have been ongoing objections to EU and NATO membership.
Gjorge Ivanov, president of Macedonia, disagrees with a referendum on the name change, saying he will also ignore the vote.
However, a group of pro-democracy supporters, including Zoran Zaev, the Prime Minister, argued that this change of name was worth joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are sounding silent. Churches in Harlem are facing difficulties.
"The ancient people I talked to told me that there were bars and churches all over the place," Adam said.
"Right now, no more."
He said the bar's disappearance was understandable.
"People get socialized in a different way than they used to be," he said.
"The bar is no longer a neighborhood living room where people are going to be daily routines."
For the church, he was concerned that the money from selling the assets would not be able to keep them as long as the leaders expected, "Soon they'll have to go back to where they were."
He added that the church was replaced by a condominium apartment building filled with people who didn't help preserve the neighborhood's remnants.
"Most of the people who buy those condos are white," he said. "This is a factor that has forced them to close faster.
Originally, these two churches were built by the white community. Before Harlem became a black-urban metropolis in the 1870s, and St. Martin's Church was built a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved in the 1930s.
The Black Community in the vicinity
The black community took over the St. Martin’s Cathedral under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, the leader of the 125th Street retail boycott, which was the main shopping street of Harlem, who opposed or did not promote black employment.
In 1939, a massive fire broke out, causing the church to collapse. When Reverend Johnson’s students planned to rebuild the church, a bell set was built as well.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Reverend Johnson and successor to St. Martin’s Church, is proud to say of the bell set: “It is the bell of the poor.”
Experts who came to play the bell set in July referred to the bell set in a different way: as "a cultural treasure" and "an unmatched historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first bell set in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago to play a larger bell set.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church had no one to replace him after that.
What happened to St. Martin's Church over the past few months has been a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom came by the leadership of the local church, others by the introduction of the royal priesthood.
The Sub-District Council - consisting of local leaders - wrote to the Sangkhamol, concerned that Sangkhamol "will find a way to throw costs" to the sub-district council even though the sub-district council is not involved in hiring these architects and contractors that Sangkhamol sent in.
Some students complain that Sangkhamol lacks transparency.
The shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California.
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving for a lobster in California at the opening of the lobster season, officials said.
This incident occurred just before 7 a.m., near Beacon Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning. When he heard a child screaming for help, he swam in groups to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that the sound was a thrill that caught the lobsters, but then he "recognized that it was a scream, 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
Hammel said that when he reached the boy's body, he saw the boy's collarbone torn open, the whole one."
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel further told the Associated Press.
The boy was picked up at the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported to be seriously ill.
Nobody knows what kind of a shark this child abuses as a species.
Captain Lifeguard Larry Giles told reporters a few weeks ago that one of the sharks was spotted in the area, but not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim also suffered an upper body injury.
After that, the beach was closed from Ponto Beach at Casablad to Swami's at Eccinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety.
Giles noticed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not dangerous species.
Sainsbury's has a plan to push itself into the British beauty market.
Sainsbury's replaces Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams with a department store style, which offers a specialist assistant for counseling.
Pushing for a concrete model to enter the beauty market in the UK with sales of £2.8 million and continuing to grow, while fashion and home accessories sales have already fallen, this huge beauty store will test the market with 11 stores across the country and will add more stores next year if the plan is successful.
Beauty investments are on the rise, and department stores are looking for ways to use floor space to replace once-in-a-lifetime TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its beauty offerings with over 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
As for existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees, they share more space in the brand’s segment as well as in stores such as Boots.
On the side of the supermarket, boutique makeup is re-opened for most products to be healthy-friendly – which is what young shoppers want more.
Meanwhile, Fragrance Shop retailer Sainsbury’s will try two concessions. The first one was in Croydon, south of London last week. The second one will be in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the behavior of consumers changing to a small number of daily food purchases at convenience stores is increasing, suggesting that supermarkets will find ways for more consumers to use them.
Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe said Outlets will look more like a department store, as supermarkets in the same conglomerate are trying to compete with stores that sell goods at a lower price than normal Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury’s has put more than a hundred Argos outlets in stores, and there have been a number of presentations since the two chains were purchased two years ago. Sainsbury’s said it helped boost grocery sales and boost the acquisitions.
The supermarket had previously tried to reform the beauty and medicine department, but ultimately failed.
Sainsbury's conducted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but this bond ended after it was unable to agree on the revenue share generated by the pharmacy in the supermarket.
So a new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
Sainsbury’s said Lloyds will also be involved in the plan by adding luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to all four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director for Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve transformed the look and atmosphere of a new store to give our customers a better feel.
We also invest in special trainings to provide good advice to our clients.
In addition to our brands designed to suit every need, there is a convenient location in a seductive and appealing environment.
Peter Jones 'very angry' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11 million joint venture.
Actor Peter Jones in Dragons Den is embroiled in 'angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from his £11 million lifestyle brand business and went on to focus on her new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV instead.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for home appliances and accessories under their Truly brand.
Both of their businesses have previously been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter, This Morning, has announced on her Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the actor of Dragons Den, in a rage, by withdrawing from the lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last second – and going on to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones "very angry" when the golden minute girl of the TV channel admitted at Tuesday’s stress meeting at his headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire’s business empire that her new contract—was worth up to 1.5 million pounds—which means she would no longer have time for their Truly home appliances and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, which once had a sales crash, and willoughby’s 11 million pound sales were doubled.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she would quit Truly Jones was flying out of England to his one-room vacation home as well.
One source said: "Truly, it was Holly's first priority.
Because that's her long-term future, which she can see to be able to take her for over two decades.
This decision to withdraw will completely shock all the parties involved.
Nobody believes this will happen last Tuesday because it's nearing its full opening day.
And there's a full warehouse at Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the UK’s most successful light stars, will cost the business millions due to heavy investment in products ranging from cushions, candles to clothing and apparel, and a delay in launch.
And that means a long end to friendship.
A mother of three, Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for over a decade.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined by holding the presidency in March.
The two families went on vacation together, and Jones also had a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin on I'm A Celebrity for ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We can't comment on this."
From the talk, 'And then we fell in love.'
He made jokes about the criticism he received from the press in providing comments that some might feel were "unprecedented as president" and very positive about North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a "announcer" voice.
"We didn't give up anything."
He noticed that Kim was interested in meeting for the second time after meeting for the first time in Singapore in June, where Trump praised North Korea for reducing nuclear weapons.
But negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stopped.
North Korea's top official, Ri Yong Ho, spoke to world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly Saturday, saying North Korea had not received a "relevant response" from the U.S. to the earlier North Korean disarmament movement.
Instead, he noticed that the U.S. was still allowing constant pressure.
But Trump still had a positive view of his negotiations.
"We are going very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were originally going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
But now we have a very good relationship."
He said efforts to connect with Kim brought positive results - that the rocket tests were over, helped to bring the hostages and the remaining American soldiers home.
And he argued in an unusual gesture when he was asked about his relationship with Kim:
"It's easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there, it's 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing in front of him.
Tsunami and an Indonesian island earthquake killed hundreds of people.
Smoke struck by the earthquake at Lombok. For example, foreign private organizations were told that they were not wanted.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has to evacuate, there is no press conference on domestic disasters. Urgent international assistance is needed.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they're very clear that they don't need foreign aid, it's a challenge," said Mrs Sumbung.
While Save the Children teamed up to travel to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign officials can land.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities are evaluating whether Palu will allow foreign aid.
The country is not ready to deal with nature’s tragic rage.
While temporary shelters for disasters, a tsunami was created at Aceh, but it is not visible at other sea coasts.
Although there was a tsunami warning, it was apparent that the lack of a cyclone warning the tsunami at Palu had a life-threatening effect.
In normal times, travel between Indonesian islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make transportation more difficult.
Nurse ships normally parked at Lombok to treat earthquake victims must first come to Palu, but to travel to the new disaster site it will take at least three days.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo addressed the issue of infrastructure improvements, as Indonesia’s main campaign for his campaign, and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
The lack of funding then made Mr. Joko's administration difficult, as he would have to enter re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faced pressure from the delaying working-class tensions of party members in Indonesia, of which most members were Muslim, and still have old-fashioned beliefs.
More than 1,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands of people had to evacuate from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought to kill each other on the streets with lances, archers, and other deadly weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool always score Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge picked up a passing ball from Xherdan Shaqiri, who was 30 yards away from Chelsea's Goal, while his team was trailing behind with a 1-0 score.
He tapped the ball to the left lightly before spooning up and shooting to the away pole.
Flowed high above the gale and floated in the upper right corner of the net.
The ball then crosses Kepa Arrizabalaga who is plunging up and into the net.
“It’s just trying to get into that position as close as possible to the ball and Shaq. Shaq always plays as much forward as possible. And I’m just trying to create as many chances as possible as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, so tapped once and didn't think much, just shot it."
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at halftime, after Eden Hazard, the Belgian star, made the score in the 25th minute.
That shot, the Blue Lions striker kicked the ball through back to Mateo Kovacic before the ball swirled close to the midfield and ran into the half side of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly sent-and-go to the midfield.
He then quickly sent a beautiful ball through to Hazard, importing it to Goal.
Hazard rushed faster than the defender and ended up kicking the shot with a left leg crossed over Liverpool's Alisson Becker into the Goal.
Liverpool will face Napoli at Group A level at the Champions League at 3 p.m. Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the national disaster agency said Sunday morning.
A lot of people are reported to be trapped in the rubble of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, followed by a massive 20-meter-high wave, said a spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference Friday.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, has become a city full of debris of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested the 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding the girl's body stabbed to death.
The Homicide investigators rushed to the scene after the body of a young woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman, with multiple stab wounds, was found early in the morning at 7.55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, along with a 32-year-old man, arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked the people in the area to see or hear anything.
Investigator for the investigation Brian O’Hagan said: ‘The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would like to ask anyone nearby John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
Especially a taxi driver who may have been caught on camera in front of the car. Please contact us because it may be important to investigate.'
A police spokesman has confirmed that the girl's body was found in Birkenhead.
And then this afternoon, the friends who believed they knew the girl came to the scene and asked where her body was found.
The investigation is still ongoing, with police saying they are in the process of contacting the deceased's relatives.
One of the taxi drivers who lived at Grayson Mews tried to request a return to his flat, but police said no one could enter or leave the building at this time.
He was speechless after knowing about the incident.
Currently, those who live at the building are said to have taken longer hours than they would have been allowed to return to the building.
One of the cops heard someone tell a man that this area is now a murder scene.
The girl in this scene cries in tears.
And I repeat, 'That's scary.'
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans parked inside the perimeter fence, one outside.
There are a number of officers standing within the perimeter fence and observing these facades.
If you have any information, please send a message directly to @MerPolCC or call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111.
The Cromwell statue, the front of Parliament, became a popular subject right now, about "the rewriting of history."
Deportation was justified in his poem The Destruction of the Taliban, which is regarded as a cultural and religious invention of Britain carried out by his strict followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, referred to Mr Crick's proposal as "a fool" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The aim of this debate, of course, is to move the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
The destruction of the imagery of the English civil war was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the accused Cromwell sacrificed himself for what his predecessor Thomas had done in the last century.
The beautiful description of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a 19th-century commentary and part of the historical study of historical figures that people still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Perhaps people remember Cromwell in terms of the defenders of Parliament against external pressure. In this case, of course, it means royalty, probably more in the late 19th century than it is today.
Which is all a realistic presentation or not, a rhetorical topic to be discussed further.
What is certain is that the conflicts that occurred in the mid-17th century have led to the development of the nation as we see it today, and Cromwell was the first person to represent that division.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are therefore worth celebrating and monumental."
Killer pig to death.
According to local news, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China.
The man, known only by his surname as "Yuan", was found with a torn arteries lying in a pile of blood near a pig rhinoceros in a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
This pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate a pig in a village in Xining, Qinghai, China on May 30, 2005.
According to the news, he traveled to Yunnan, a neighboring province, with his cousin, to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found an adjacent pig-roofing door open.
He said that one of the great pigs in the cave had blood on his mouth.
According to news reports, the legal results confirm that this 550-pound pig has infested this farmer to death.
"My cousin Lu's legs are bloody and broken," said a cousin whose last name is Wu, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
According to surveillance evidence, Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pig.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed this man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked to prevent further attacks while waiting for the police to gather evidence at the scene.
According to the news, Yuan's family is negotiating with the market executive for compensation for his death.
The pigs did not attack people until they died. But they were not known to have been written before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a young woman with her husband on their farm in Massachusetts.
And ten years ago, there was a 650-pound pig, clutching one of the navels and his tracker until his wife came out and threatened and chased him away.
Then, after one Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pig was not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood could be "a trigger."
"They're just jokes.
They're bite-sized, curious, they're not meant to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them properly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's tail brings heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States thoroughly.
According to predictions, Hurricane Rosa is weakening after blowing through cooler waters off the coast of north-central Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to the north-west of Macedo and the south-eastern United States in the next few days.
Roza has a gusty wind passing at speeds of 85 miles per hour as a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday at 5 a.m. local time on the east coast and is 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move through the north on Sunday.
At the same time, waves of wind are forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving east along the U.S. west coast. As Roza approaches the Baja Peninsula, California on Monday, tropical storms begin to propel thickening tropical moisture into the southwestern United States.
ROZA will bring 10 inches of rain to all parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity then interacts with incoming wind waves, causing torrential rains across the entire southwest region in the coming days.
Locally, a drop of 1 to 4 inches of rain will pose a risk of sudden flooding, drifting debris, and landslides in the desert.
The densely covered tropical humidity causes rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour at various points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that rainfall across the Southwest will be as much as 2-4 inches, but more than in the Arizona area.
With thunderstorms spreading, the floods are rapid and can be intensified.
Be careful not to travel barefoot in the desert with heavy rainfall.
Rainfall can cause deep valleys to flow and thunderstorms to cause strong winds and dust.
This approaching wave will bring heavy rainfall in the region of Southern California's coast.
Half-inch rainwater can cause minor drifting debris and slippery roads.
It is expected that this is likely the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Some of the scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona during the late hours of Sunday and Monday morning, before that rains will spread during the late hours of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to Four Corners during Tuesday and will stretch until Wednesday.
The period of October will see a thicker temperature swing passing through the U.S. due to the Arctic becoming cooler, but the tropics are still warm.
This event sometimes changes temperature in nearby cities.
There are very good examples of different temperatures throughout the central U.S. on Sundays.
By cities with temperatures varying to nearly 20-degrees, such as between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis with Des Moines, Iowa.
And in the coming days, the warm, bleak summer will form and spread again.
The U.S. Central and Eastern Regions
New York City may have temperatures as high as 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be 10 degrees higher than normal temperatures.
Our long-term weather forecasts have shown that there is a high probability that the U.S. eastern temperature in the first half of October will be higher than normal.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony.
On Thursday, more than 20 million viewers watched the presentation of evidence of the nominee as High Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh with Christine Blasey Ford, from six television networks. The young woman accused him of attempted rape in the 1980s.
While the political controversy continued, television stations changed Friday's regular program at the last second due to Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake) allowing the FBI to conduct an investigation of that crime for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent confident that Kavanaugh rubbed her torso drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh responded emotionally at the junior jail that he was 100 percent confident that the incident was definitely not going to happen.
Nelson reported on Friday that there should be more than 20.4 million spectators following the testimony.
The company has an average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, it is not possible to count the number of viewers instantly with other networks broadcast with it such as PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And then, normally, Nielsen has trouble counting the number of viewers in offices and workplaces.
The size of the spectators is the same as those of the semi-finals or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, the station, has actively launched a list of comments supported by Kavanaugh’s appointment, leading the entire network with an audience of approximately 5.69 million people. In its all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with a peak of 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had a peak of 3.1 million, NBC a peak of 2.94 million, MSNBC a peak of 2.89 million, and CNN a peak of 2.52 million, Nelson said.
Attention remained high after the deposition ended.
Flake is the main character in the story that happened Friday.
After a controversial Republican's office announced that he might vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN's camera and CBS caught a video on Friday morning that he was being yelled at by protestors as he tried to take an elevator to testify with the Judiciary Committee.
CNN has broadcast a picture of him standing in his neck for several minutes after being painted.
"I stand before you now," said a woman to him.
"You think he's telling the truth to the whole country?
"You have power while all women have no power," he was told.
Flake said his agency had made a statement, and said before the elevators shut down, that he would have a lot to say to the board.
Cable and television networks have covered all live broadcasts for live broadcasts during the time when the Judiciary Committee voted to drive the nomination of Kavanaugh into a vote to become a full-fledged senator.
However, Flack said he would only do so when the FBI will investigate allegations related to the appointment next week, which is a request from Democrats' minority voice.
In part due to a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons (Democrat Sen. Chris Coons), Fleck feels convinced to believe that he will be able to make a difference.
And after talking to Coons and several Senators, Fleck made up his mind.
Flack's selection was powerful because it was clear that the Republican would not vote in favor of Kavanaugh without a previous fact-finding check.
President Trump opened the way for the FBI to conduct an investigation, finding the facts on all charges related to Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses commentators of 'playing politics' with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May criticized the commentators who criticized her plans to leave the European Union as a "political play" with Britain's future and undermined national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May travels to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview on the first page of the same newspaper, next to her interview, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, proposing to the UK (Britain) and the European Union (EU) to tax each other "completely wrong."
Wayde Sims was shot: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police arrested one of the suspects in a violent shooting incident, causing the death of 20-year-old Wayde Sims, a LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and booked for second degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Police said the confrontation between Sims and Simpson in the official video revealed that during the fight, Sims had dropped his glasses.
And when the police found the glasses from the crime scene, they found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, with CBS joining WAFB's report.
Police added that after investigating Simpson, he made the confession that he had shot Wayde severely.
Advocate reported that his bail was set at $350,000.
Preliminary reports from the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office on Friday said the cause of death was a head to head gunshot wound.
The police department credits the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police homicide laboratory, the Southern University police, and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the district law enforcement for "absurdity and the pursuit of justice".
Simms, 20.
Six-foot-six grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 points for the rebounds in the last season's game.
On Friday morning, Koch basketball coach LSU's Will Wade said his team was "very upset" and "shocked" with news of Weyde's death.
"Here's what you'll be worried about all the time," Wade said.
Volcanic ash enters Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the neighboring city in the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from volcanoes, after detecting a reaction in the crater, and recorded 183 emissions over the last 24 hours.
The center has observed multiple shakes and crunches.
Social media images show light ash on the windshield in Mexico’s neighboring cities, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysists have observed an increase in volcanic activity at 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The baby volcano is known as "Don Goyo", which has remained populated since 1994.
Catalan separatist supporters clashed before the end of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters in support of the Declaration of Independence clashed with anti-government police, while thousands attended a parade to witness the first anniversary of the Catalan vote on separatism.
The group supports separatist forces covered faces with egg-throwing masks and powder paints to police who try to block them, causing scattered dust in roads that are normally crowded with tourists.
The rumbling happened afterwards until the police had to use batons to suppress it.
And for hours, a group of supporters of the Declaration of Independence prayed "No forget, no forgiveness" against the protesters of the union who shouted, "Long live Spain!"
Local media reported that fourteen people were slightly injured in the protests and were being treated.
Tensions in the region with the idea of independence remain high. After one year, let after the referendum, Madrid is thought to be illegal, but supporters of Catalonia separatism are still celebrating.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the result was low, with most anti-semitists boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to restrain voters from going to electoral units, causing serious clashes.
A group of independent secessionists had camped overnight Friday to assist police in preventing the march.
The march continued but was forced to change course.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old fireman, has joined the protest for segregation of the territory with his wife, saying he felt hopeless, Catalonia would not have had a chance to gain independence.
"Last year was the year we lived with one of our best memories.
I look at my parents, and I'm glad we're voting, but we're stuck now," he said.
Despite a significant but frightful victory in last December’s regional elections, the Catalan pro-independence party is still struggling to maintain its momentum this year, as many of its well-known leaders, if not forced to disband, wait for a referendum on their role in the subsequent referendum and declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old worker, has documented the protests on his phone as evidence of support to the police, saying the conflict has been digitized by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia imprisoned before the trial from late last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to criticize seeking backwardness on the values of democracy and suppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Many men have been arrested after driving into a house.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after crashing into a house several times.
This event was revealed to be at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, Thursday, local time around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Chief Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage occurred at the fence and the building.
There was a wooded front also caught fire in the car as at some point.
The Menga's Strike resulted in Livingston winning the Rangers to a 1-0 lead.
"Dolly Menga's first Gold for Livingston victory".
Livingston's victory amazes the Rangers under the leadership of Steven Gerrard as manager of the club Ibrox, who lost just twice in all 18 games.
Dolly Menga's streak proved to be the difference, as Gary Holt's side moved up the level to second for Hibernian.
Gerrard’s side is still desperate to win this season’s Premiership, with Hearts leading by eight points next Sunday.
Prior to that game, the Rangers home team faced Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston won another six games with a fantastic run in the lead of Chiefs Coach Holt, but was defeated when replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity to clash with the away team.
The Holt team took the lead away from the Rangers in shock.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the opponent to the Gold front, and Alan Lithgow was able to stop Craig Halket from reaching Gold.
The home team let the Rangers play first because they know they will be able to defeat the away team very well.
And that's Gold's awesome story in this game.
Rangers have free kicks, and Livingston has opened Declan Gallagher and Robinson. They’ve blocked Menga at the end, but they can still touch the base and score from the center position.
In that period, Rangers took possession of the ball, but couldn’t break in, and Gold keeper Liam Kelly blocked it without a problem.
The format continued to be used in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos tried to defend it from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was intercepted by Rangers' Goldkeepers then Allan McGregor and Lithgow Switch ran through and scored from Livingston again.
Continue the game in the Livingston field with two free throws - from which Halket replaced Glenn Middleton and once again from handball.
An Analysis of 'A Great Game' From Livingston
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland reports from Tony Macaroni Arena.
Livingston’s Great Performances and Results
Everyone on the team played exceptionally well and exceeded expectations.
Both their play style and approach have changed dramatically since their early return to the title, and great credit to Holt for altering the team from which they joined.
He has created a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket is the leader of the defense team and has excellent control of the game, while Menga continues to be Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall as raid stars.
Although Rangers lacked previous inspiration,
They lack leadership and are far from the degree to which they did best in the days of Gerrard.
They missed the last ball just because they opened the sidelines to the struggling team, and that made the Rangers realize that they were among the ready-to-wear fighting teams entering the semis.
Erdogan is well received and diverse at Cologne.
Both the smile and the blue sky on Saturday (29 September) at the breakfast meeting of the Turkish and German leaders in Berlin.
President Erdogan’s visit to Germany lasts for the purpose of strengthening relations with NATO allies.
They have discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press, and joining Turkey's European Union.
Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is the location of the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for intercepting a crowd of 25,000 people gathered in front of a mosque, but there are still many supporters nearby who want to wait to meet with their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of whom were Kurds, blamed both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to visit the country.
The protest reflected a disparity for visitors, who were regarded as heroes by some of the Turks.
Car crash at Deptford: cyclist dies of car collision
One cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford and south-east of the city. Local time was around 10:15.
The driver stopped and the paramedics immediately came, but the cyclist's man was already dead in the incident.
This collision occurred after a cyclist died of a collision and fled about a month ago on Childers Street, about a mile away from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said authorities are identifying the deceased to notify relatives.
Roads and buses are closed, and drivers are advised to avoid them.
From Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in the disturbance.
Six officers were injured in a disturbance at a tightly guarded man-in-arms prison, prison officials said.
That turmoil occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at local time around 09:30 on Sunday, and continued.
A group of Tornado Specialists entered the facility, which had a total of eight detainees, and was assembled on one wing.
Officers suffered minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A representative from the prison said: "Specially trained prison staff will be dispatched to deal with the ongoing disturbances at HMP Long Lartin.
There are six staff to be sent into treatment.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that they will be handed over to the police and mean that they will be imprisoned for a long time."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison's governor had been hospitalized after being attacked by one of the inmates.
And in October last year, riot authorities called for a serious turmoil in which prison officers were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa attacks Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas may benefit)
It is a very rare event that a depression will strike Arizona, but it will be an upcoming event early next week, if the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa straddles the Desert Southwest poses a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has begun monitoring the immediate flooding of Arizona on the west, to eastern and southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City from Monday to Tuesday.
It is expected that Rosa will wade through Phoenix on Tuesday, which will cause rain in the late hours of Monday.
The weather agency in Phoenix saw a message on Twitter saying, "Since the 1950s, only ten tropical cyclones have remained as tropical storms or tropical depressions within 200 miles of Phoenix.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest model from the National Hurricane Center predicts between 2 and 4 inches of rain, some up to 6 inches at Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, have a rainfall of 1 to 2 inches, with some areas up to 4 inches.
In areas with severe flood risk, Rosa rains can be good as the region has long been plagued by drought.
Although the floods are a very concern, the rainfall is very useful in some areas, as the Southwest is facing drought.
Weather.com reports that according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, roughly 40 percent of Arizona's area is facing severe drought, level two."
The first time, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Roza's strength remained strong Sunday morning, with the highest storm-force winds of 85 miles per hour, at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and was moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit cooler waters on the Pacific Ocean, weakening.
So it is expected to land in Mexico with the tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening Monday.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico poses a significant flood risk.
"It is expected that a total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches from Baja California enters the northwest part of Sonora and is likely to reach as high as 10 inches," Weather.com reported.
Roza then turns into a tropical storm and travels through northern Mexico before turning into a depression on the border of Arizona on Tuesday morning, blowing through Arizona into southern Utah in the middle of the night on Tuesday.
"The most dangerous part expected from Rosa or the rest is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and the Desert Southwest of the U.S." from the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause deadly acute floods and debris floating in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
The attack on Midsomer Norton: arrest of four men tried to kill
Three day-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested. One of the suspects tried to kill a 16-year-old boy who was found with stab wounds at Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was spotted at the Excelsior Terrace, the area of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday. Local time is around 04:00 BST.
He was taken to the hospital while in barely-existing condition.
One 17-year-old, along with two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old, were arrested that same night in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The officer asked the witness to report to the police.
"Trump says Kavanaugh's 'was the suffering, the humiliation, the anger' of the Democratic Party."
"The vote to Judge Kavanaugh was a vote that rejected the impeachment and radical tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a campaign on a car in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh led the Democratic Party to "suffer against evil, anger" over the length of his appointment.
Kavanaugh gave a speech in front of parliament on Thursday, strongly denying and passionately criticizing Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he sexually assaulted her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford confirmed the allegations she made in the testimony.
The president said on Saturday, "The American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliant intelligence, qualities, and courage that day.
"The vote to confirm for Kavanaugh was a vote to confirm one of the most successful lawyers of our generation and a jury with the best public service record," he said to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
President Kavanaugh was nominated when speaking about the importance of the midterm election results for the Republican nomination.
"The next five weeks will come at one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running towards it," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for a good candidate."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "against and obstruct"
The first major vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, GOP Senior Leader General Secretary told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in a tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them were swept off the beach when an earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi, Indonesia on Saturday.
Hundreds of people flocked to the festival on the beach of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six meters (18 feet) broke into the shore at dusk and swept away many people.
7.5 aftershock earthquake after tsunami
"While the tsunami hit yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach, unable to escape until they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's relief agency, BNPB in Jakarta.
"The tsunami came not only to the waves, but to the trailers, trailers, houses, and to land everything," Nugroho added, adding that the tsunami hit land at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour).
Some climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
There are approximately 16,700 people evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by disaster authorities show that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges deformed and collapsed, and mosques surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake up coastal towns on Saturday.
Aftershocks struck several other earthquakes, which could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Bureau for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s major earthquake was about 200 times the atomic bomb power of Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay, can cause an increase in the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extremely damaging" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, department stores and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, he said, adding, and another 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the number of deaths and damage could rise along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, near the epicenter.
Communication "is totally absent and there is no information," said Donggala, Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a further statement that officials and volunteers are heading towards the affected area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
There was widespread criticism about the agency on Saturday that no tsunami had been reported in Palu, although officials said the wave had come within the time of the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you can hear a shout from a man on the top floor of the building about the upcoming tsunami approaching people on the streets below.
Within minutes, the water wall hit the shore and smashed into buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the images immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused major power outages and caused communication around Palu to be cut. Therefore, it is difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Soldiers began to transport cargo planes with supplies to help from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but the refugees still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s dedicated airport is open for relief, but will remain closed commercially until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the refugee center in Palu on Sunday.
The damage from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 800.
It's a terrible story.
While World Vision staff traveled from Donggala to Palu, where staff stayed temporarily at a temporary shelter made of tarpaulins installed in the courtyard in front of their office, they safely passed through the wreck site, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me he saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's awful.
Despite the strong and serious efforts of the aid group, some advocated that specialised foreign aid workers were prevented from travelling to Palu.
As per Indonesian regulations, foreign aid, equipment and staff can only enter the site if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster only," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we're opening up foreign aid, but it's not there yet."
The second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, friends and family of the missing are still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescue unit rescued a young woman from the rubble of the limestone she was attached to her mother's body.
Indonesia’s national glider team, Gendon Subandono, has been training Asian gliders for games that have just ended earlier this month in Indonesia and are missing.
Mr Mandagi added that the other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a senior on a glider line, I felt terrible," he said.
Mr. Gendon reiterated that after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse had been shared among a group of gliders, he had attempted to send a WhatsApp message to rivals at Palu who were celebrating on the beach.
But either way, his message appears only as a single gray mark, not as two blue marks.
"That means the message can't reach them," he said.
A $26,750 robbery went from an ATM at Levee, Newport.
On Friday morning, a group of robbers robbed $26,750 of Brink's agents while they were filling up the money into an ATM machine at Newport on the Levee, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver cleared the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to put more money into the terminal. Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the news.
While he was busy there, another man "runs from behind Brink's employees" and steals a bag of money prepared to put it in the closet.
According to the news, witnesses were seen several suspects at the scene, but police did not detain the number of suspects involved in the incident.
If you have any further information, please contact the Newport Police Station at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Yee.
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yee.
This change was announced on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It is officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for quite some time now, and used that name on his eighth album released in June.
This change came before he would appear at Saturday Night Live, where he would announce his new album Yandhi.
He performed as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande who canceled the show due to "emotional causes", the show's manager said.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current name, West has also said that this word has a religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is a word that has been used very often in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year while discussing his album's name with the organizers of the Big Boy Radio show.
"So, I'm you, I'm us, all this is us.
Starting with Kanye, which means the only one left is Ye - a reflection of the goodness, the badness, the confusion, everything that belongs to us.
This album is about reflecting on our identity."
He's one of the many rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was previously known by many names as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year his most favorite name was the Love and Brother Love.
A West associate, JAY-Z, used to write with or without hyphens and uppercase letters.
Mexico's AMLO vowed not to use its forces to fight the civilian side.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who was elected president but did not take office in Mexico, vowed not to use military force against civilians, as the country is entering the 50th anniversary of the student bloodshed.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that Tlatelolco Plaza "will not use military force to suppress the Mexican people in any way."
Troops shot at peaceful demonstrations at the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing more than 300 people at the time. As the movement of left-wing activists spread across Latin America,
Lopez Obrador vowed that he would support Mexico’s educated young people with a monthly subsidy and would also open a free public university.
He also said that jobless and lack of educational opportunities have led youth to turn into gangsters.
The U.S. should double the A.I. subsidies.
Since China is very keen on artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding, said Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and entrepreneur who previously worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
This comment comes after all sectors of the U.S. government announced AI, with no official AI strategy yet supported.
At the same time, China has initiated a plan since last year, with China aiming to be the No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"The double increase in AI research budgets is a good start, making countries that are behind the U.S. remain behind, and we expect a big improvement in AI," Lee said.
A double increase in funding will double the chance for the U.S. to achieve its next great AI feat, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, the author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order," published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most famous companies about AI in China. Face++
In 1980 at Carnegie Mellon University, he tried to make an AI system that had won the top American player Othello. Then he was the executive director of Microsoft's research department and president of Google's China branch.
Lee thanked the previous government-funded technological competition, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would happen so he could continue to consider the vision.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work very hard to get government support, Lee said.
"It's not China to pull out its educational leadership, it's a bunch of companies," Lee said.
Now, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired graduates from universities to work in AI.
Lee said that changing immigration policy might help the U.S. in AI development.
"I think the green card should be automatically issued to Dr. AI," he added.
China’s State Council announced the next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The China's National Natural Science Foundation has funded the public in educational institutions, just as the National Science Institute and other governmental organizations have funded U.S. researchers, but China's education work is of lower quality than Lee's.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which means that there will be partners from the industrial sector with schools and universities involved, and the White House has announced a selection of committees in the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA also announced that it will invest US$2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF recently invested more than $100 million a year in AI research.
But at the same time, the U.S. law requesting to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence hasn't made any progress in months.
The Macedonians will go to a referendum vote to vote on whether to change the country's name.
The people of Macedonia will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia". This move aims to resolve disputes that have lasted more than a decade with Greece, which has made it impossible to join the European Union and NATO at the invitation.
Greece, which also has a state called Macedonia, still wants its northern neighboring countries to retain the same name as its territorial claims and to prevent it from entering NATO and the European Union (EU).
The two governments had clashed in June due to the new name being proposed. Patriotic rivals argued that the name change would undermine most of the Slavic people's national identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the referendum would reach at least 50 percent of the vote.
The question in the referendum vote was: "Will you be a member of NATO, NATO and the EU by acknowledging the terms of the Agreement on Greece or
Supporters of the renaming, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worthwhile for Macedonia, which is one of the countries that has been isolated after the fall of Yugoslavia, if it has become part of the Council, such as the EU and NATO.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of the nation, young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska, in Skopje.
While not legally binding, there are enough parliamentarians who say they will hold the vote.
That name change must be voiced two-thirds in Parliament.
The National Select Committee said at 1:00 p.m. there were still no reports of irregularities.
However, only 16 percent of voters cast ballots in the 2016 parliamentary election, with 66 percent voting.
"I'm voting because of my kids, we're in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje's capital city.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko, voted in a referendum on the renaming of Macedonia to open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union (EU) at Strumnica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament, 54-year-old Skopje Vladimir Kavardarkov held a small stage, and protesters held several chairs in front of the tent.
"We are ready to join NATO and the EU, but we want to join with pride, not with a service outpost," said Kavadarkov.
"Although we are poor countries, we have dignity.
If he doesn't want to adopt us by the name of Macedonia, we can still turn to other avenues like China or Russia and become part of a mixture of Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring a desirable investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the majority of citizens are fond of it because over 80 percent of citizens are fond of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after dropping his voter ID card.
He said the effect of "responsibility" will be a confirmation of our future."
A poll conducted by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia published on Monday found that 30 to 43 percent of voters will vote in a referendum, which is lower than the number of registered voters.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
And 70 percent of them said they would vote. Agree.
In order for the referendum to be unanimous, the number of voters must be 50 percent plus one vote.
This referendum failure will mark the first major political missed by a West-supported government since its inauguration in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero dribbles through the defenders of Brighton and then shoots
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent the ball past Brighton's defenders in the match against Manchester City, resulting in a 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the score in the 65th minute seemingly unbelievably easy.

He ran through Brighton's three defenders before kicking off into the outdoor field.
He then finds himself surrounded by four green shirted players.
He spins through one defender before running faster to the edge of Brighton's Goal.
And then he ran past the left to find Sterling.
An English player in front of the Goal sent the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to kick the ball across the Goal of Brighton Mathew Ryan to the right of the net.
"Aguero has some problems at his feet," City Manager Pep Guardiola said to reporters.
"We talked about his play in the 55th minute, 60th.
That's what happened.
We were so lucky he made the score in that moment."
But it’s actually Sterling that gave Sky Blues the advantage from the very beginning of the Premier League.
The leading score was done in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero gets a ball that goes deeper into Brighton's territory.
He passed a beautiful ball to the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane dribbled away before taking Sterling to the far post.

Scherzer Wants to Clash with Rockies
When the Nationals quit, it was a great opportunity.
But Scherzer, who has always been a contender, hopes to win over the Colorado Rockies in the Sunday Match, but still fears the style of Rockies play to be the winner throughout the game against the Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
The Rockies went on to gain a penalty spot and win the Nationals by a score of 5-2 last Friday night, but still aim to be ranked in their first division.
"Although we didn't win, at least we did get to taste the atmosphere of this Denver match with the fans full of the field and the other teams with the highest level of play results I've had the chance to play with all over this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in this contest?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starters for Sunday, but they are likely to give Scherzer a break in this situation.
Scherzer will play his 34th game of the season, starting on Thursday and returning as a regular hitter on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander had a score of 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 Strikes, including 220 2/3 laps this season.
Trump went on a campaign trip to West Virginia.
While the president spoke about the importance of the number of Republicans voting in the midterm elections, there was a reference to the events surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's indirect election to the Supreme Court.
"All we did was bet in November.
Five weeks from now will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big things -- I'm not just running, but I'm really running around everywhere to find the best candidate," he said.
Trump went on, "Have you ever seen the creepy extremist group of Democrats?
They're trying to take back power, whatever it takes, so you can see their badness, their disgust.
They don't care who gets hurt, who gets trampled on for that power and control, they'll do anything, but we won't give them that."
A group of Democrats were assigned to "stand up and interfere" in every way, he said.
"Which you've seen in the last four days," he added, calling the group Democrats "enraged, outraged, hateful, and unrequited."
He referred to the Democratic Senator, who, by the order of the National Legislative Council, was Dianne Feinstein, who received a loud cheer from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Did you leak the paperwork?
Yeah. Yeah, what?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for one -- that's a terrible body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The labor is no longer an open community.
If anyone speaks according to one's own mind comes out, it becomes unacceptable.
When the activists of Momentum in my local party criticized me, it wasn't a pleasant surprise.
After that, I was the last person on the list of Labour MPs who were told that we weren't welcome - all of them spoke their minds.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan also suffered a similar tragedy when she stood up against Jewish extremism.
In my case, the Magistrate criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
And in Europe, it's the same problem that Jeremy disagrees with the previous leaders.
A notice to the Nottingham East Labour Meeting (Nottingham East Labour) on Friday stated that "we need a comprehensive and effective meeting."
For me, as a member of the Labor Party for eight years, the GC meeting on Friday was really that.
Sadly, today is not the tone of many meetings and "merciful, gentle, polite" political promises that have been forgotten for a long time, but in fact, have never happened.
It's clear that opinions are unacceptable to the Labour Party, and all opinions are to be settled by the party's acceptance or incompetence.
This happened after Jeremy took the lead for a while, because my colleagues who I thought could share similar political images began to expect me to turn around (U-turn) and take a position I never thought I would accept – whether for national or EU security.
Whenever I talk -- it doesn't matter what I say -- it's often followed by insults on social media that I shouldn't be elected.
But that's not just me experiencing.
I know I'm luckier than many of my colleagues because opinions directed at me are mostly political.
I am apprehensive of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who can face the flow of sexual humiliation or class daily, without embarrassment and discouragement.
One aspect I'm most disappointed in today's politics is why insults can become so common.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week to the cultured foster labor party of tolerance, tolerance, generosity.
But in reality, we are no longer a community that accepts open opinions, with every move "without confidence" or a change of some rules narrowing the party's mind.
I've had a lot of advice in the last two years, ask me to bow down. Don't talk too much, and then I'll be "okay."
But that's not what made me step into this political line.
Since I joined the Department of Labor 32 years ago as a student, there has been a spark from the neglect of the government. Thatcher dropped my idea of going to the school, but turned to doing public service for the most demanding - whether to go as a member of the local council or as a minister.
I never hid my politics even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East will be confused about my political position and the stories that I disagree with the current leaders.
For the activists on Friday, all I can say is that when the country is plowing towards Brexit, all our households, businesses and public services will be damaged. I don’t understand why they would waste my time and energy on the leader of the Labour Party.
But there is one sentence I really want to say, but not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters. Whether it’s a labor member or not: I feel very proud to serve you, and I promise that no harassment or political advantage will stop me from doing my job that I think is the best of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham East.
"Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's Victory".
The latter two attempts may have made a poor final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves a victory in this Premiership match of Tennent.
Right now, they're top ten that nobody can take down.
At the end of the day, it’s a great defense, as well as taking home the opportunity, and coach Peter Murchie is smiling at the result.
"We've been through the whole game, and we're still going through it, so I deserve to be delighted," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Credits for Ayr, they snatched better opportunities than we did."
For the 14th minute of Grant Anderson’s tie by sending Ayr ahead of Frazier Climo, but with the Scottish captain Rory Hughe getting the yellow card, the Warriors were let out of the game, allowing Melrose to shallow the game and allow Jason Baggot to drop the tie.
Climo pushed Ayr up to the penalty spot before the end of the first half. He scored a solo try to put the tie at 17-5.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half. With Patrick Anderson’s baggot pass, the leeway was only a five point lead.
Then there was a relatively long pause due to Ruaridh Knott's leg injury, and after starting a new game, Ayr quickly opened the scoring with Stafford McDowall's Tyr Ball by sending off the climo.
Blair Macpherson then captained Ayr and was given a yellow card. Melrose scored on Bruce Colvine’s tie, ending in a fierce game.
The home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson hit the yellow card with a Climo impact without a ball, MacPherson touched down from the penalty spot and Ayr was able to bounce back.
Climo immediately forwarded at the start of the new game after Kyle Rowe got the kick from David Armstrong and passed it to Gregor Henry to get the fifth tie for the home team.
Still Game star turned to a new career in the restaurant industry
A star in Still Game, Ford Kieran turned to the hospitality industry after being identified as a director of a listed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star starred as Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, where he wrote the script and co-starred with the old comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
Both announced that the upcoming nine-episode series would be the finale of the show, and it appeared that Kieran was planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official list of records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
He declined to comment on this, although Scottish Sun sources speculate that Kieran was considering joining the "interesting restaurant business" of Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia has no way of reaching the sea, hoping the court will decide to reopen its path to the Pacific.
The squadron patrolled the Navy's headquarters at La Paz.
These buildings are decorated with blue flags.
The navy, with bases ranging from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, adorned with the motto: "The sea is our right. We have right at sea.
Granting that right back is a duty."
Every part of Bolivia without a way to the sea is a vivid memory of the loss of the coast to Chile in a bloody event about the 19th century resource conflict - because it was a fervent desire to sail again into the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may be the highest in more than ten years, as Bolivia is waiting for a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia is active, has a singular spirit of serenity and serenity. And of course, watching the results come out with a positive expected gesture," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomatic officer.
The Bolivians watched the decision by the ICJ with large screens located across the country. With the hope that the courts in The Hague would agree with Bolivia's claim that - after ten or more years of occasional talks - Chile was forced to negotiate to allow an exit to the sea with Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the very talented native of Bolivia - who is facing a re-election debate next year - has a lot to rely on this Monday as well.
"We are so close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe the court will not judge Bolivia - but that could change.
The UN Council, which has its base in the Netherlands, has no authority to judge the territory of Chile and specifies that it will not determine the outcome of a possible talks.
The ICJ's ruling comes six months after the final debate, suggesting that the case is "uncomplicated," said Chilean international law expert Paz Zárate.
And if to find the cause of the bolivia farther away, it may have to go back four years ago.
"The problem with access to the sea was hijacked by the ruling Bolivarian regime today," Zárate said.
The rhetoric of Morales' brawlers undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she pointed out.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss this, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussion after this.
Both countries have had no diplomatic exchanges since 1962.
Aide President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a special opportunity to open a new era in its relationship with Chile," and an opportunity to "end the inconsistency of the differences in mutual interests that have existed for a period of 139 years," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who remains one of the presidents of Latin America's most popular citizens - had used the issue of shipping as a political leaning stick.
"Bolivia will never give up on the right to access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"Court decision making is an opportunity to view how we need to move beyond the past."
North Korea has said that reducing nuclear weapons will not exist until they are able to trust the U.S..
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never reduce its nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
Ri said on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly:
He called on the U.S. to follow up on the promises made at the Summit in Singapore between leaders.
He commented that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to have begun another diplomatic round of nuclear talks after a meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un over three months ago.
Ri said it was a "pipe of dreams" that continued U.S. endorsements and objections to the end of the Korean War declaration would lead North Korea to mistrust.
Washington did not trust the war's end until seeing Pyongyang take down the weapon as a first step.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
Pyongyang will give up its treasury, which the country sees as the only way to guarantee the country's security?
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting for Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Show reveals the latest flagship flagship stores
If you want to add a hat to your wardrobe, or you want real sun protection, you don't have to look anywhere else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased their cutie hats for the SS19 collection on the runway at Paris Fashion Week.
An unlikely hat for everyday life has hit Instagram this summer. These designers send their creations into the catwalk.
Valentino’s signature cap is a wide-brimmed hat made of feather-like material. The puffs are puffy above the head of the model.
Other things that are larger than usual, like a jeweled watermelon cap, wizard's cap, and even a pineapple cap - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks with- and which also fit into the Halloween period.
There are a lot of colorful masks sewn in the mouth that look more like Hannibal Lecter than there are designs coming out of the top coat room.
There's one invention that looks like a diving device, with both diving goggles and on the surface, while the other looks like melted ice cream.
And if you're still following this big fashion statement, you're very lucky.
A stylish watcher expects a huge cape of women's hats to be sold at the main store near you.
This much larger hat typically has been hot since 'La Bomba'. We will see this two-foot wide straw hat from many, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat, which cannot be used in everyday life, collapses through social media, creating another invention on the catwalk - a beach bag with a bow, almost as large as that of a swimsuit model.
Fresh orange palm-covered bag with palm stripes and white leather handles is one of the most iconic pieces in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
A renowned designer, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: ‘I expect to see these big hats and beach bags coming to the main road next summer – because the designer has created such a big impact. It’s hard to overlook the need in accessories that are bigger than this usual.’
John Edwards: Essential Language Skills for Global Citizens
Scotland’s private schools have a track record of academic excellence and continue in 2018 with another outstanding set of exam results that are strengthened by individual and group success in sports, art, music and other communities.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), are committed to providing the best services to students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for further education and above selected careers and places as global citizens.
Modern English is a popular and preferred subject within the school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone else in a language he understands, the words will go straight to his brain.
If you talk to him in his language, that speech goes straight to the heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on this year's latest exam results, we can see that language is more important with the highest passing rates in private schools.
68 percent of students in total, who are studying foreign languages, will receive a high grade A.
The data gathered from 74 SCIS-membered schools shows that 72 percent of students achieved grade A high in Mandarin, 72 percent studied German, 69 percent studied French, and 63 percent studied Spanish as well.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language learning in order to enhance the skills that children and students need in the future.
Today, language is one of the choices of subjects, as is STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private schools and beyond.
According to a survey by the UK Employment and Skills Committee in 2014, 17 percent of employers have difficulty hiring vacancies due to language skills shortage.
Therefore, language skills will become more important to prepare students for future careers.
Due to increased job opportunities, these skills are important in the globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, if they learn a second language, they will have this huge advantage in a self-taught future.
To communicate directly with people from abroad will enable multilingual people to take advantage of the automatic career advantage.
According to YouGov’s survey of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough, and French was the only language to speak, and the proportion was 15 percent.
the Thai Language Training Center
Being able to speak many languages, especially in developing countries, will provide children with a better chance of finding work.
In Scotland, each school is taught a different language.
Many schools will focus more on classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that seem to be the most important for the UK. Looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what language your child is interested in, there are many languages to choose from in private schools with professional instructors.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and trains the skills needed to succeed regardless of the future.
And it can't be denied at this time in a global business environment that language is still very important for the future of the country, so this has to be reflected in education.
And modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".

Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron to debut with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking to restart LeBron James with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would start playing the season opener on Sunday with the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But there's no indication of how long he'll be playing.
"Sure it will last longer than a minute and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers, tweeted that James may have played in limited time.
After training earlier this week, an inquiry was made into James' plans for Lakers' six pre-season warm-up schedule.
"I don't need a pre-season game to get ready for the real season," he said.
Campaign time with Trump at West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump launched a campaign rally tonight on a campaign car in West Virginia.
This is Trump's first five-time rally next week, as well as stops in interesting places, including at Tennessee and Mississippi.
For the vote, insisting for the election to fill a vacant position for the Supreme Court, Trump aimed to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, since the Republican Party was at risk of losing seats in Parliament when it voted in November.
When does the Trump campaign rally start tonight in West Virginia, and how do you watch it online?
The Trump campaign rally in West Virginia will begin at 7:00 p.m. West tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s campaign rally in West Virginia online below via livestream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to make a speech about the Brett Kavanaugh trial this week, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, having been charged with sexual misconduct by a Senate vote that remains unconfirmed during an investigation by the FBI for a week.
But the main goal of the rally's campaign this time was to help increase the voting base for the Republican Party in the upcoming November election.
This week, President Trump’s five rally goals were “incited volunteers and Republican supporters to come out to defend and increase their voting base so that they could occupy as much of their parliamentary seats as before,” Reuters news agency said.
"The number of seats in parliament is the main goal of this presidential multi-state trip, as it is approaching the re-election season," said an unnamed Trump campaign spokesman to Reuters.
Tonight's rally will have supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, including media from Pittsburgh," West Virginia Metro news agency reported.
This Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia within two months, a state in which they had a higher vote share of 40 percent last year.
Trump is trying to gain support for Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for Congress in West Virginia, endorsing the poll.
"This is a very bad sign for Morrisey that the president has to come down to, boosting his own voting base," said Simon Haeder, a political analyst at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show the spirit of victory in Sunday's singles match.
After three one-yard sessions, four Saturday afternoon sessions were exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
Each centrifugal shock is the perfect concept for this sport, something that golfers often believe in, but not this time.
Now, what's the centrifugal force supposed to be?
"They had a six point lead, and now there's four more, so we thought, no rushing," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the game that day.
Of course, Europe now has the advantage, leading by four points and 12 shots to play.
As Spieth said, for The Americans, they thought they were going pretty well, and they were very supportive. Not only was Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together all day long and getting three out of four points, both of them.
Spieth leads from T to Green and leads the team by making it look like an example.
A little louder to reach his round, and had to put on a significant pitch with Foreall Square, when both he and Thomas used both shots.
His putt gave them a 15-game winning streak and got everyone excited, believing that the American team was no more than a game-changer.
"You always sink and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
Which all players tend to be like this.
18 holes to win
The only players with a higher score than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have been in the history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely match from Europe was four points out of four and never missed anything.
"Moliwood" is the only pair not to pass the bokeh on a Saturday afternoon, but they also avoid bokeh on a Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at pit nine on Friday morning.
The energy they both have, and the cheerleading squad believes they will win on Sunday, with no other player approaching victory for Europe, other than Fleetwood or Molinari, for this match at Le Golf National.
Especially when they both play at different holes.
Europe's victory remained unchallenged, even though it was not over yet.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the game even more fierce against Sergio Garcia, the Fourball Star Hero, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
The bokeh and two shots at the ninth hole caused Spaniard and Swede to take the end.
On Sunday, everyone will be determined to end the game.
Interestingly, Fourball and Foursam are intertwined, suggesting they tell each other what they don't recommend, and remarkably strategically plotting game-changers.
Europe played very well as a team and brought the game to a halt on the last day, but in the Foursome it showed that the USA team was struggling, especially Stateside.
"Europe lead 10-6 in Ryder Cup final".
Europe took advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after scoring points from the Fourballs on Saturday and the Foursome Game with a score of 10-6, defeating the United States.
Duo partners Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have twice won the Tiger Woods by four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn of the European team still holds the cup where he was defeated at Hazeltine two years ago and beat the American team in the Match Four ball early in the morning with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. went on to play in the Final Four, winning two games, but was still unable to keep up with the score.
Jim Furyk's side also needed another eight points from a single 12-match game on Sunday to retain the championship.
Fleetwood is a rookie, the first European team to win four points in a row. As he and Molinari pair up, they are dubbed "Molliwood" after winning the game on the weekend, the second pair to win four points from four matches in Ryder Cup history.
They beat Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourball Match, then beat Woods and Bryson Dechambeau, the new American team, by a score of 5&4.
Woods, who went through two matches during Saturday's semi-final, showed scoring again, but today he lost 19 out of 29 games in the Football League and Forsyth and consecutively.
Justin Rose from Fourball in the morning returned to the match against Henrik Stenson in the quarter-finals, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka by a score of 2&1, the world’s number one and third.
Europe doesn’t have the perfect rose petals for a cool day in the southwestern part of Paris today.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new American record with two points on Saturday.
They beat Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in a Fourball game with a score of 2&1 and came back to win over Poulter and Rory McIlroy again in Fourball with a score of 4&3.
In Ryder Cup history, only two times a team has been able to win in a single match, despite a lack of four points, even though Furyk only wanted to retain the title.
However, after returning to the top two for the first time, it seemed they couldn't come up in Sunday's game.
North Korea declares 'no way' to disarm only one party without being trusted.
North Korean Foreign Ministry officials said on Saturday the United Nations continued to declare sanctions because of the serious lack of trust in the U.S., and there is no way the country would be able to disarm nuclear weapons alone in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho said at the world's annual general meeting that North Korea imposed "significant measures of goodwill" in recent years, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and refusing to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any response from the United States at all," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there would be no confidence in national security and under such circumstances there would be no way for us to disarm only one party first."
While Ri filed a complaint from North Korea about Washington's opposition to how to "reduce" it to nuclear disarmament, North Korea was awarded a gradual procedure for carrying out the nuclear disarmament. His statement seemed significant that there was no denial of nuclear disarmament alone, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a statement signed jointly by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to carry out "nuclear disarmament in the Korean area" while Trump pledged North Korea's security.
North Korea has officially tried to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also insisted on resisting calls to repeal the North Korean sanctions.
"The U.S. insists that it would "remove nuclear weapons first" and increase pressures to achieve its goals in an oppressive manner, and even object to the ""declaration of war,"" Ri said."
"The idea that sanctions will make us subservient is the idea of people who don't know about us well.
The main problem is that continued sanctions create even more distrust for us."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which U.S. leaders informed the United Nations earlier this week.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs stressed the importance of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the parties on the issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament in the Korean area would not be so disrupted.”
Still, Ri's tone was somewhat different from last year when he informed the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea's targeting of rockets to the mainland of the United States was an event after the "evil president" Trump called Kim a "human rocket".
At this year's United Nations conference, Trump, who threatened to "abstain" for North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in carrying out the disarmament, but also said that there was still much work to be done, and would continue the Korean sanctions until North Korea's nuclear disarmament was completed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for this. "If it takes two years, three years, or five months - that's okay."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should award Pyongyang the right to act in this regard.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions imposed by the Security Council must be taken seriously and not cancelled until we have confirmed a total and total nuclear disarmament."
Security Council has unanimously supported the North Korean sanctions since 2006 to auction funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo went to North Korea three times this year, but his final trip was not very successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that the progress had only been made by North Korea condemning his actions as "the order of the Mafia" within an hour of the meeting.
North Korea pledged in a meeting with the Moon this month that it would carry out missile disarmament and nuclear facilities if the U.S. imposed "a consistent measure".
He said Kim told him "consistent measures", which he expected to be a promise from Trump in Singapore that would guarantee security and take action to build a good relationship with Washington.
Harvard University students take an adequate course of study with a break
This year’s new course at Harvard University will give all undergraduate students more sleep. To end the extended education culture using caffeine as a fuel for ‘all night owls’.
Scholars find that the world's top university students often have no idea when it comes to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first course in the United States.
He was inspired to start this course after discussing sleep deprivation, which affects learning.
'At the end of the course, a female student came to me and said, 'Why did you just tell me now when I was in my senior year?'
She said, 'No one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me a lot,' he said to The Telegraph.
The program, launched this year, will explain to students the importance of good sleep habits, how they can improve learning and sports, and improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course, after finding students very sleepless and hard over the past week.
Time-consuming courses including interactive tasks
In the first category, there is a room picture in the dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books. It is told about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance and the importance of regular sleep times.
In another category, students are explained how long-term sleep deprivation can pose a risk of heart disease, seizures, depression, and cancer.
Campus maps with interactive icons help students think about their daily lives.
'We know we can't change student behavior right away.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you do, the right to know the health effects of cigarette smoke," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in ‘being a late night owl’ remains, he said, cutting-edge technology and increasing pressure on students show that sleep deprivation is an ever-increasing problem.
To ensure that you have adequate and good quality sleep, it should be a ‘secret weapon’ of the student to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said. Even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation will cause the brain to enter mode of starvation and will cause hunger at all times.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course by taking one of his courses last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said, "This course gives him a bright eye and inspires him to push this course to the entire campus."
The next step is that he hopes to be able to ask all graduate students to graduate in the same program before entering any competitive system.
Professor Czeisler advises students to consider setting up an alarm when it is time to go to bed. It is time to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ emitted from the electronic screen and LED lights, which are bedtime issues.
"Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga make goal from Gerrard's delivery ball".
Rangers were heartbroken by the loss again when Dolly Menga strangled Steven Gerrard's delivery and defeated them by 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side recorded his first win of the season, coming from a 4-1 tie in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team faced Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving behind eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga made the move seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers seemed unable to score any more.
While the Rangers were in sixth place, Livingston came up in third place and was only a short distance away from Hibernian with the number of Golds.
And there may also be more problems for Rangers when Calum Spence gets a head injury from an object floating into the field.
Gerrard decided to replace eight players. That led Ayr to the Betfred Cup Final.
At the same time Holt remained the same Livi 11 player who focused on Hearts and was able to knock down opponents in every match.
Rangers may have dominated the playoffs all along, but Livingston went on the tag and scored.
They had a chance to score just two minutes when Menga passed the ball to Scott Pittman, allowing Allan McGregor to make the Gold, but the midfield managed to tag the lead.
Keaghan Jacobs' free kick helped put the ball through to Craig Halket. But his defense opponent, Alan Lithgow, managed to tag the defense.
Rangers tried to control the game, but seemed to be hopeful that the track was futile in the end play.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should get a penalty shot in the fifteen minutes he collided with Steven Lawless, but Commissioner Steven Thomson denied the Colombian appeal.
Rangers managed only two shots in the first half, but Liam Kelly, the former Ibrox goalkeeper, was separated from Lassana Coulibaly and made the Ovie Ejaria Strike.
In the 34th minute, Livi opened the scoring, and no one was able to resist the ball.
"Rangers miss out again on Jacobs defense".
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who could add the Menga to close the game beautifully.
Gerrard sizzles and suffocates Coulibaly so Ryan Kent can tear off his flank and pass the ball to Morelos, but Kelly is running hard.
However, Livingston still enjoyed the game against the away team with long balls from Lithgow and Halket swapping around.
The Holt side may have had a chance in the final game, but McGregor blocked the Jacobs well before Lithgow ran from the corner.
Rangers converted Glenn Middleton and found a penalty when he tried to keep the Jacobs apart, but Thomson missed again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And here is a news page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882. This same day 136 years ago and starting the counting ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which contains artifacts that lead to a device called the Geiger Counter.
Geiger Counter became the leading genre of science, as well as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans: The New York Times.
Man: "What are these devices?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger Counter, it can be used in the search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on headphones, you hear the effects of radioactive atoms in minerals. "
Evans: "It's like a burst of fireworks!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention which used this name remained so until the present.
This new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to see the malignant cells.
This new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to 'see' the malignant cells and destroy the malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, which are part of the treatment.
The procedure consists of isolation of immune cells from the patient and modification in the laboratory.
They'll be able to 'see' the common proteins in cancer cells, and then be recycled.
This experimental vaccine shows satisfactory results in multiple sclerosis patients.
A woman was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize malignant cells, and the result was that her ovarian cancer had gone away for more than 18 months.
This method separates immune cells from patients. It is taken to modify them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the common proteins in many cancer cells called HER2, and then the cells are recycled.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "Describes the growth of various cancers" including breast, ovaries, lungs, and colon cancer. Professor Berzofsky explains
It is a similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells used in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West left Pro-Trump Diatribe with a MAGA hat following his SNL appearance.
Which isn't very well done.
Kanye West was fired in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a performance where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would play politics in 2020.
After the third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great hat, he spoke out against Democrats and reiterated Trump’s support.
"Many times I've talked to a white man, and they said: "Why do you like Trump, he's out to divide the class?"
Well, if I were against class-action, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began a show with Matt Damon, whose Hollywood star joked about Brett Kavanaugh's investigation of sexual harassment charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not published, West's press briefing was uploaded via social media from comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock is trying to discredit West.
Similarly, West is told to the audience that he has trouble with his hat when he's backstage.
"They tease me when I'm backstage.
They say, 'Don't walk away with this hat.'
They tease me!
And after that, they also said I was in the bottom position," he said, according to a Washington Examiner report.
West went on to say: "Do you want to look at the bottom position?" He said he would "put on my Superman robes, because this is showing that you can't come and tell me what I should do. Do you want to push the world forward?
Try to give love."
His speech was horrified at least twice by the audience, and SNL members were so embarrassed it was reported by those in the event: "The whole studio is quiet."
West replaced Ariana Grande, who had a boyfriend who died a few days ago as a rapper with Mac Miller.
West surprised many with the I Love it song that he dressed up like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing side by side with MOB."
But the talk show host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West is a "pioneer" and "representing who he is and how wonderful."
"But I choose not to salute someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art') who, I believe, has an ideal that is harmful to my community.
He was free to do so.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show began, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and that he was "a person formerly known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change the name and operate after Diddy, who was then known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The legendary rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly known as Snoop Lion, and of course, the legendary musician, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and an artist formerly known as Prince.
Murder at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast last Friday.
This incident occurred at Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant will be brought before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.

Kit Harington, the actor from Game of Thrones, has received a lot of ratings.
Kit Harington is best known for his sword swing role playing Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, an HBO fantasy series.
But a 31-year-old actor published about the hero's role, saying that the role on the screen was to portray young people who often felt that they would be brave to get respect.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that he believes ‘there is something wrong’ and asks how to tackle the issues that have been so popular in the #MeToo era.
Kit is currently married to Rose Leslie, 31, a fellow Game of Thrones star. He also admits that he feels the need to address the 'seriously' problem.
'I feel personally and seriously that we have created a misguided popularity about being a man at any point in time,' he said.
'What should we teach men when they grow up in the problems we face today?'
Kit believes that television is responsible for the strong character's preference.
He continued: 'What is by birth, and what is cultivated.
What was planted on TV and on the street made a young man feel that he had to be strong to grow up as an adult.
I think this is an important question for all of us.
Because it's obvious there's something not right for young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be doing Game of Thrones for the next season as the series ends this summer. He said, 'Enough is enough for the battlefield and the horses.'
From November, Kit will feature in the sequel of Sam Shepard's True West, the script of the film maker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought his meeting with his wife Rose was the best he could get from Game of Thrones.
'I have met my wife on this list, so in this way it has allowed me to meet my future family and my life from now on,' he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, who falls in love with Jon Snow. The character Kit plays in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the family's Leslie's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases.
China reported a 14% increase in the number of HIV-infected and AIDS-infected populations.
More than 820,000 patients are in the city, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new patients are infected through sexual intercourse, marked as a transition from the past.
In the past, HIV was transmitted through transfusions of infected blood in some parts of China.
But the number of HIV-infected patients has reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a meeting in Yunnan.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a major problem among LGBT people in China.
Homosexuality is no longer considered a crime in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination remains.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have been conducted and found that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
These transmissions come from improper prevention of relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has made international commitments to engage in the use of HIV-treated drugs as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that employees gave information about Senator GOP extortion on 'fraud' and 'conspiracy'.
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters has denied any information about her employees posted on three U.S. Republican senators on the Legislative Wikipedia page last Saturday.
Democratic Los Angeles said the charges were investigated by experts and the website
"All lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data report includes the home address and telephone number of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was shown online on Thursday. It was posted by an anonymous person from Capitol Hill during a Senate Committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against a nominee of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
This leaked information was posted after three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP address given the source of the post is linked to the Office of Waters and published the official data of Waters reported by Hill.
"All these unfounded allegations are completely false and, of course, these are lies," Waters went on.
"My staff, whose identity, personal information and security are affected by these false and deceptive allegations, is not responsible for any leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and certainly a lie."
Waters' statement received quick criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial shows anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that she doesn't have enough emotional maturity to become a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, don't be angry.
They don't have to interact.
They don't need to go into the accused's motives.
They must be calm and conscious."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to a Democratic Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of showing too much anger during an investigation last Thursday.
Republican Omar Navarro has also seen Waters in the midseason election expressing his thoughts on Twitter.
"Severe, but real," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned “the right authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims.
"We will do everything we can to expose the offenders," she continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that endanger all members of my team."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Reviewed by Rowan Atkinson
Now it is common to look for the implications of Brexit in any new film that shows British leanings. And it does not seem to involve the restoration of Johnny English’s action comedy – it began back in 2003 at Johnny English, and the team returned in 2011 with Johnny English’s return.
New opportunities in the country's exports
By any means, comedian Johnny English faces the problem of renewing a contract for a second time. His name has become a symbol of the widespread creation of comics, designed for non-English speaking countries.
Of course, he's a crazy spy who, despite being a pretend freak, has Clouseau's aura, Mr Bean's death comedy, and chariots of Fire melodies, arranged in London in 2012 for the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
He also based the personality of a global traveler, Atkinson, when playing a commercial on Barclaycard TV that is no longer available.
With a nice atmosphere in the latest JE framework.
I loved Johnny English on the way to the helicopter and wearing a vest and the paddle on his helmet.
Atkinson has a talent for comedy, but it's not quite as humorous. Especially for movies like 007 and Mission Impossible, which also have a line of comedy included in the present.
Humor is childish, and to me, Johnny English’s adventures are not very creative, and they focus more on silent jokes in Atkinson’s movies and bean styles.
The most common topic these days is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker has infiltrated the UK’s top-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all agents in the UK to destroy their active agents. That’s a sad role for Kevin Eldon.
The final straw for the Prime Minister, who is a swindler and a man of struggle, is experiencing a political fallout that is not popular: Emma Thompson takes the role as Quasi-Teresa-May, but does not have much role in the script.
Her Secret Service advisor informed her that when all active spies were exposed, she would have to send them out of the country.
And that translates to Johnny English, who is now employed as the principal at an establishment, but has a lesson in how spies work: with jokes inserted, as English presents a rock spy school.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and was reunited with his partner, Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married young man who has played a role as a sub-commander before and has a fun personality who is not a good fit for Vicki Pepperdine to take the role.
For Batman and Robin, who have committed a terrible crime against the Queen's protection, come to the throne again. Plays Olga Kurylenko by the beautiful girl Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is in danger under the spell of an extraordinary talented billionaire, who claims he can solve the problem of Britai's computer: Jason Volta, who is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started the story with a joke: disguised as a waiter, set fire to a French restaurant. They created chaos on Volta’s luxury yacht smuggling mission. English and the band tried to use virtual reality headsets to familiarize themselves with Volta’s home decor.
Good storytelling, but still funny and fun.

And like many of Johnny English's other movies, I can't help but wonder if the British film industry doesn't have Rowan Atkinson in a role that fits his abilities.
The labor department rejected Britons' plans to work four days a week, but had to pay wages for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s labor department is considering a working plan. It can be seen that the Britons are working only four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
It was reported that the labor department wanted the company's boss to increase staff's happiness through AI by adding special holidays to them.
As you can see, the employees were happy three days a weekend, but still paid the same amount.
Sources said the idea "fits in" with the economy and adds benefits to the staff.
The transition to a four-day work week was approved by the Trades Council and helped staff benefit from this transition.
A senior labor source said to The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
‘This change will not happen overnight, but only works four days a week in line with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for workers, including the party’s overall industrial strategy.’
The Labour Party will not be the first to approve the idea, but together with the Green Party it is asked to work four days a week during the 2017 general campaign.
However, it has not yet been certified by the labor department.
A labor spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not a party policy, and the party will not be brought into consideration.'
Shadow Prime Minister John McDonnell used a labor conference last week to define his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he intended to withdraw power from the 'directors' and 'financial seekers' for public sector companies.
The shadow Prime Minister is planned, but current shareholders in the company may not receive any additional compensation, since the labor sector may have a deductible error.
He also confirmed that workers would be placed on board the company and created the Inclusive Ownership Funds, giving 10% of private company shares to employees up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said to "60 Minutes" that the FBI's investigation results for Kavanaugh's case may have made them change their minds.
An FBI investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh's case has been postponed for at least a week, and it does present whether the office's findings affect Republican senators.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 minutes," Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, regardless of whether the FBI was under anything that would lead to a change of judgment.
It seems that Kennedy is more open-minded than his colleagues from South Carolina.
"Absolutely," said Kennedy.
"I said I was on my way to attend an interrogation, I said, and I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this news, with the question, 'Do you really do?'
He has certainty, determination."
However, Graham's vote to be recorded was quite long.
"I made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and will receive a harsh sentence," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know: Brett totally rejected it," Graham said further, in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"and all the names she has been invincible.
Aged 36 years
I don't see any new changes."
What is Global Citizen Festival and how does it contribute to poverty reduction?
On Saturday, New York hosted the Global Citizen Festival, a year-round musical event featuring performances from some of the world’s most famous stars, as well as a mission to end poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year for the World Citizens Festival. Tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park’s large lawns to not only enjoy shows like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness, which is the real goal of this event – to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival in 2012 is an additional project of Global Poverty, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting poverty.
To obtain a free ticket for the event (unless you have to pay for the VIP ticket), participants must complete missions or "events" such as volunteering, writing emails to world leaders, making calls, or taking actions in any way that will help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen to achieve its goals within the remaining 12 years?
The idea of awarding free concert tickets is simply a way to convince people to take action, or it is another way called "clicktivism", which makes people feel they are making a real difference by sending online messages or tweeting.
Global Citizen said that since 2011, more than 19 million "activities" have been recorded from supporters, pushing for the creation of different goals.
These activities have motivated world leaders to announce more than $37 billion worth of commitments and policies that could save the lives of over $2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and declarations stemming from the Group’s activities, which have totaled at least US$10 billion in disbursements or raises.
The group has assessed the fund, which has helped nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of its key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a group of UK-based investors whose aim is to "help children grow to their full potential", promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in cities after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK Government, donors, the UK Government, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make malnutrition, which is a social injustice, become history,” an ambassador from The Power of Nutrition told the crowd during a live performance in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities were carried out in calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will support up to 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "This will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we may fall and fail.
But like the Great Civil Rights and the previous anti-semitism movement, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe were one of the performances held this year in New York, held by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy "enclosure" to deter Russia from exporting energy - Interior Secretary
Washington's inspector general quoted Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke as saying, "If necessary," Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting various markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke referred to Russia's Syrian meeting - notably, that it carried out the government's invitation in accordance with that law - just an excuse to explore the new energy market.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to represent the energy trade as they do at Eastern Europe, which is the belly of Southern Europe," he said, according to news reports.
And, as officially stated, there are solutions.
With our Navy, the United States has that ability to ensure that ocean channels are open, and to close the way if necessary, to ensure that their energy will not go out into the market," he said.
Zinke is referring to an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that characterizes itself as the "voice of energy users" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's practices in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were equally effective.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said. While referring to Russia as a "one-horse" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as Trump’s administration is on a mission to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe instead of Russia, a cheaper alternative for European consumers.
As for that effect, Trump's administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, attempted to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, as Trump said, made Berlin a Moscow "captain".
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11,000 million dollars, is set to double its already existing pipeline capacity to become 110,000 cubic meters, purely economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's violent objections were merely driven by economic reasons and exemplified by unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be used as a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude generated a strong German reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), has urged the United States to retreat from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I had a big problem when the third state intervened to supply our energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), after a meeting that followed between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "keep a close eye on" the nomination for president in 2020, said Massachusetts State Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "be closely watched" in the post-election presidential run.
During a meeting at the municipal office in Hollyoaks, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our dilapidated government and that includes having women on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will keep my eyes on the presidential candidates closely."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during a meeting at the municipal office, saying he was "bringing this county in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren spoke out loud about her criticism of Trump and Brett Cavanaugh, who were nominated as members of the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Obviously we need to have an FBI investigation before the vote is up."
However, a poll that came out on Thursday showed that the majority of Democratic citizens who support Warren don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters "who are likely to be in" the state of Massachusetts said Senators should not be enrolled, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the application.
The poll showed that there was even greater support for a run-off candidate to former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent of the vote supporting a possible run-off candidate and 48% disagreeing.
Others with high-profile positions in the Democratic Party debated the potential 2020 runoff, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Vermont Senators.
Baidu says he will make a formal decision by January, AP reports.
Sarah Plin, PTSD's reference to the track Plin at the Donald Trump rally.
Track Plern, who is 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence incidents on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through, what he's going through, is coming back, I understand other families who feel PTSD's dislocations and something traumatic that our soldiers have received," she told an audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pelin called the name of his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans. "They came back slightly different. They came back stronger. They came back and wondered if there was any respect for what military comrades and comrades, pilots and other members of the army had given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasylla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons while intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states in the District of Columbia support the new refugee policy challenge.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories filed a memo Friday in Washington to challenge fugitive policy, reported by NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions suit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against an undisclosed federal policy.
She said her partner "and her radical gang member son" persecuted her, but U.S. officials rejected her refugee request on July 20.
She was paroled in the state of Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced many asylum applicants in the United States, as countries that faced widespread gangs and domestic violence.
A new U.S. refugee policy reversed the 2014 Refugee Committee’s decision to allow undocumented refugees to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy is "neglected to the laws of the state, Congress, and the international ones that have been in place for decades."
"The laws of the Federation require that all asylum claims be diagnosed with the facts and circumstances of that claim, and that such action violates such principles," the court's companion notes.
Lawyers have argued that denying immigrants' immigration policies cause damage to the U.S. economy, saying they tend to become entrepreneurs and "feed necessary labor."
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to flee victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"A refuge is available to those who have left their home country due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in certain social groups or political opinions," Sessions said in a policy announcement on June 11.
asylum has never been a way to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Palu’s desperate rescue efforts double as deaths accelerate survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse and worse.
"It feels very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, while comforting her little boy with a fever at the refugee center in the busy city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings a body to anyone.
That clean water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, scouring for water-tight items, trying to recover any debris they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were packed.
Some of the injured include Dwi Haris, who suffers from a broken back and shoulder. Stay outside Palu's military hospital where patients are being treated outdoors due to an ongoing violent earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he reminisces about the devastating earthquake that shook his five-story hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"There's not even time to save yourself from harm.
I've been squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the AP, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife beg for help, but then there was silence.
I had no idea what had happened to her and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'coupling'
A week after the daily four-page Chinese newspaper in the United States soliciting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, U.S. and Chinese ambassadors accused Beijing of using American media to disseminate propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump Wednesday cited China Daily’s additional spending on the Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-seller newspaper – after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. parliamentary election. The accusations rejected by China
Trump’s accusations that Beijing was attempting to interfere in the U.S. election mark what U.S. officials told Reuters were the new phase of Washington’s rising campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to issue advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an increasingly violent trade war, which allows them to adjust tariffs on imports of each other's goods.
Early Chinese counter-terrorism tariffs were designed to attack exporters in states such as Iowa supporting the Republican Party, Trump said, Chinese and U.S. experts.
The U.S. ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, Terry Branscut, a major agricultural exporter to China, said Beijing had damaged workers, farmers and American businesses.
China Branch wrote in a comment in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "Now double the bullying with the propaganda of our own independent newspapers."
"In publishing that propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American liberal and media-loving tradition of free speech by placing paid ads on the Des Moines Register," writes Brandt.
"On the contrary, on the streets of Beijing, you will find a very limited dissent and no real reflection on China's problematic economic trajectory, assuming the media is under the harsh Chinese Communist Mandate," he wrote.
He also added that "one of China's most famous newspapers evaded proposals to publish," his article, although he did not say which one was the paper.
"Republicans discourage midterm female voter turnout by crackdown on Cavanaugh, analysts warn".
According to some top Republicans standing by and defending Brett Cavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in the face of multiple allegations of sexual harassment, analysts warned they would see particularly strong backlash from women during midterm elections.
The mood surrounding this was staggering, and most Republicans said they wanted to move on with the vote.
Those things can't go backwards," Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the University of Syracuse Maxwell, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he was skeptical of Senator Jeff Flake's last minute push (R-Arizona) for the FBI's investigation that would be enough to calm the mood of angry voters.
"These women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget it tomorrow and not November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted, "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate hall, while the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee chose to move on with Cavanaugh's nomination. Despite a statement by Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford, reported by Mick.
"The enthusiasm and motivation in democracy is going to skyrocket," said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst who was not affiliated with the news site.
"People say it's already high. That's true.
But it could go even higher, especially among female voters who are swinging in the suburbs and younger voters 18-29 years old, where, while they don't like the president, they often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggested severe repercussions would follow if Republicans pushed that confirmation forward.
"This has become a mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's also about how the Republicans manage this and how they treat her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, who helped select the Democratic Party, clarified to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to have a distinct voice as to who would believe in the wake of Ford's and Cavanaugh's statements, too, to lean slightly on the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents are absolutely convinced or may believe in Ford's statement, while 35 percent say they are absolutely convinced or may believe in Cavanaugh.
It added that 38 percent said they thought Cavanaugh might be lying or lying, of course, during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same thing with Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is now investigating allegations that Ford raised, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under an oath last week that Cavanaugh had exceeded her while intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez accuses the nominee of being a Supreme Court member, revealing his genitals to her as they join a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web plan to start a new kind of internet to fight Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of Inrupt Technology Legacy is a company built on Berners-Lee’s open source Solid Platform.
Solid enables users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "to rule the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of such a start.
"It's a historic moment".
Such apps use Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online storage" or POD.
It can contain contacts, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's special about personal online storage is that it completely depends on who has access to what kind of data.
This company calls it "personal empowerment through information."
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, the idea for Inrupt is for the company to use appropriate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid work for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM. Some regular developers have signed contracts to work on projects and a community of volunteer coders.
Earlier this week, tech developers around the world were able to create their own separate apps using their existing tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change, where all their business models would be completely inverted overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
A post on the Associated Press published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote, "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial and ecological energy to help protect the health and quality of new sites built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the Internet neutrality debate.
Even at the time of launch, Inrupt Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web group of companies, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for the next generation of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: a Victoria Cross priest (an honorary medal of the British Army), World War I, celebrated.
The only Church of England clergyman to have won the Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown 100 years ago.
Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Wainwright received such an award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by snipers four days later and was never known to have received the British Army's highest honor.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandsons at a marching yard event in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was a "wonderful symbol". This stone will be revealed exactly 100 years later, counting on his grandfather's award-winning achievements.
According to a London official announcement on 29 September 1918, Colonel Tovanne led his battalion across the de Saint-Quentin Canal "through thick fog and under heavy mortar fire from artillery and heavy machine guns".
Afterwards, he hurried to the firing line, and with the "greatest courage" led the firing line forward, before striking the artillery alone and striking three troops.
Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just one month before the war ended.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were: "Something I know I can't follow the pattern, but it's something that's humble.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid down a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "was especially honored to take part in this parade" and added that "the heroic courage of the real has been expressed out of support by a large number of people."
MMA fans are at an early dawn to see Bellator 206, they get Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you've been up all night watching the packed Bellator 206 just to get rejected from watching the main event.
Bill from San Jose has 13 fights, including six big matches, and is live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in the UK was shocked when the footage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some don't appreciate after they've slept until dawn for this particular fight.
A fan on Twitter said of switching to children's cartoons, "It's a boring joke."
"As per the official regulations at 6 a.m., the content was inappropriate. They had to be turned into a children's show," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator. When asked about the swap.
"Pork girl." That's right."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will set a timeline to include the British audience in the future.
"I think when I think about replays, I think we might as well pass through smoothly," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday there, and we won't be able to fix this until Sunday at our time, Monday at their time.
But we're working on this.
Trust me, there's been a lot of text switching back and forth, and they're all unfriendly.
We've tried to fix it. We think it's a technical flaw.
But it's not. It's a government issue.
I promise you, next time, it won't happen.
We're going to keep it at five instead of six - as we usually do - and we've tried to deliver too much to the fans and we've just reviewed it.
It's one unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dailey Feels 'Inferior' in Sexuality
Tom Dailey, an Olympic jumping athlete, said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that has inspired him to succeed.
A 24-year-old man said he didn't think until he went to high school, "Not everyone like me."
When it comes to Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, first presented by Lauren Laverne, he says he has mentioned gay rights in giving "hope" to others.
He also stated that becoming a ruler made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the presenter of the long-standing list, has quit his job for months due to illness.
It seems to me that being a drifter on Laverne's first show, Daley said that he felt "a little bit more" than all the others who had grown up because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings that are so small and different have really given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something special," he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally knew about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner became the LGBT campaigner who watched and used his appearance in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to reduce homosexuality as a crime.
He said he came out screaming because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without partition and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said of having fallen in love with a man - Dustin Lance Black, the filmmaker. Who he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley was married to the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, to last year, but he said age differences were never a problem.
"When you've been through so much since you were young" - he first went to the Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he says it's hard to find the same age-appropriate people everywhere.
This couple became parents to a child in June; a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all-over attitude" had changed.
"If you ever asked me last year, it would have been all about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there's something bigger than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medallist is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not admit that he was dying and that one of the last things he had asked was if they had tickets for them to go to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't say to him, ‘Father will never be able to get a seat in the front row,'" he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and until he really stopped breathing, and he died, I finally admitted that Dad wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I just realized that this is what I've been dreaming of all my life - to jump in front of the crowd from my home country at the Olympics, no one feels any better than this," he said.
It also inspired his selection of his first songs - Proud by Heather Small - which resonated with him in his formation towards the Olympic Games and still made him creepy.

Mikaelson forms a sitting duck in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson would set a new record on Sunday when he played his 47th Match Ryder Cup, but he would have to turn his form back in order to avoid it becoming an important event of grief.
Mikaelson played at his 12th two-year event, benched by Jim Furyk, captain of the team for the Fourballs and the Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action as he always was for the United States, this big five-game winner splits his day between being a cheerleader and making his game on the field hoping to solve what caused him to miss the playoffs.
The 48-year-old is not the ideal fit for the Le Golf National course, where a long and rugged course has already beaten off a number of off-roaders.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Michaelson in the ninth match on Sunday will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to beat the four match-ups this week.
If the Americans were four points below the start of a single 12-match match, a hot start could be a big deal.
Furyk shows confidence in his people. It's not like he can say much else.
"He understood the role he had today completely, slapped softly on my back and patted my arms on my back and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He was very confident in himself.
He's a recognized talent, and he's given these teams a lot of time in the past, and this week,
Maybe I didn't imagine him playing double-match.
I imagine more than that, but that's the way it fits out and that's the way we think we have to.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
Mickelson would break Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Match Ryder Cup match played on Sunday.
It may be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson won 18 times, losing 20 times and the other seven and a half, but Furyk said his identity brought with him something difficult to describe to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty, he likes to play around with people, and he's a great guy to be with in the team room," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun with him, too, this week, which was fun to see.
He gave more than just play."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the leading score may soon be missing.
European captain Thomas Bjorn learned from experience that entering the last day of the Ryder Cup singles round with a modest lead could easily cause discomfort.
The Dane debuted at the 1997 event in Walderrama, captained by Sebi Bajesteros. It had five advantages over the American team, but it was a narrow nose-to-nose victory, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 - 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we’re doing a lot of face-to-face at Walderrama. We’re ahead at Brookline where we lost and at Walderrama where we won, but we’re only getting closer,” Bjorn said, taking a photo, after watching the floor of 2013, winning 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team sees that this isn't over yet.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Go out there and do the right thing.
This will not end until you have scored up on the board.
We have one goal, and that's to try to win this prize, and that's where to focus.
I've been talking all along, I've focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's standing across that - the greatest player in the world."
Given the pleasure his players have made on the hard-fought golf course coming out, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't do anything beyond myself in this regard.
Tomorrow's another fierce beast.
Tomorrow's a solo show to step forward, and that's a different thing.
It's great to be there with partners when things go well, but once you're there, one by one, you'll be fully tested as a golfer.
That's the message you want to reach the player.
Now, you have to leave your partner behind and he has to go and do his best, too."
Contrary to Bjorn, opposite Jim Furyk, his players will be looking forward to a better individual performance as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three quarters.
Furyk himself used to be on both sides of the final day’s big turn, being part of the winning team at Brookline, before ending up being defeated when Europe performed a “miracle at Medina”.
"I remember every word," he said in an answer when asked how the captain of the 1999 Ben Crenshaw led his players to the final day.
"We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get to that quick start as you can see at Brookline, as you can see at Medina.
When that momentum starts pouring in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those medium-sized mats.
We rowed our order accordingly and brought them out in a form that we felt would be right, you know, we're trying to create some kind of magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with attempting to lead the offense back and faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and other European Ian Poulter in the top half of the order.
"I agree with this group, in order, because I think it has covered everything," said Bjorn, selecting a single player.
Germany's new warship has been postponed again.
German Navy’s newest medium-range warship should be piloted in 2014 to replace the already aging Cold War warships, but it won’t be there until next year at least due to faulty systems and cost-producing media reports.
The first experiment of the "Rhineland-Palatinate" class of medium-sized warships, the new Bard-Weerttemberg, was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, referring to a spokesman for the Defense Ministry.
This ship should have joined the Navy already in 2014, but problems after delivery have adversely affected the fate of ambitious projects.
The four Baath-Württemberg class ships ordered by the Navy back in 2007 will replace the age-old Bremen medium-class warships.
It is understood that they will be equipped with one powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisible technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustics.
Other key features include longer maintenance periods - the newest medium-sized warships should be able to be launched for up to two years off the port of origin.
However, the ongoing delay means that this state-of-the-art warship – which was said to give Germany the light of power abroad – will be obsolete by the time it takes office, Die Zeit said.
A medium-sized F125 warship, whose fate was a prank made headlines last year. When the German Navy officially refused to pilot the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg,
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the carriers after delivery.
Not much reason is known behind the return, but the German media cited an overwhelming number of “software and hardware mistakes” that rendered warships useless if deployed on combat missions.
Software faults are of paramount importance as the Baawang-Württemberg class warships are controlled by over 120 crew members - only half of the manpower in the Bremen class medium-sized warships.
the U S Navy 's
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" was believed to weigh twice as much as the same class of ships that the Germans used in the Second World War.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including crew training - is becoming another problem as well.
It is said that up to 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion US dollars) - an increase from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems at the latest medium-sized warships became more important when it was recently warned that Germany's sea power was shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defense Committee, admitted that the actual fleet "started to leave no available warships."
Officials said the problem was time-consuming because the old ship was decommissioned, but no new one was replaced.
He regretted that no medium-sized battleship, the Batwain-Württemberg, could fit into the fleet.
National Guard eavesdropping on the bats' secret lives.
The new research that is being carried out on land on Scott's high ground is intended to reveal how bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
the Flying Mammals
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland follows the soprano rat bat and the common rat bat, as well as the brown eared bat and the Daubenton bat at Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key points throughout the area to track the various activities of the bat throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using mobile sensors.
All recordings analyze the bat’s transmission frequency, and what species are they doing?
Mapping and reporting residential housing will be made to visualize the detailed racial ratios of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that this outcome will reveal which habitats are most important to this bat and which are being used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of housing management tasks such as pasture making and the best way to maintain forestry for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and across the UK has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development work affecting housing and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can be risky, as well as sticky paper catching insects and the treatment of building materials with certain chemicals, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bat is actually not blind.
However, due to their night-time hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they are caught.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to accurately identify bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is taking the bat very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who perform regular surveys, residential inspections and occasional rescues.
The organisation also established the first and only Scottish bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight species of bats from ten species of Scotland.
The area manager David Thompson said the land was ideal for them.
"At this Threave, we have a wonderful space for these bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and all the good housing.
But there's a lot more about bats that we don't know yet, so the work we do here and at other landfills will help us understand more about what they need to grow out the offspring."
He emphasized the importance of inspecting bats prior to maintenance within the land due to the destruction of single breeding habitats, possibly killing up to 400 females and young offspring, which could wipe out the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, harass or disrupt their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the bat conservation organization, has encouraged the public to come together to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we don't know how well their populations are."
Ronaldo denied the accusations of rape while the lawyer was ready to sue German magazines.
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the accusations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "need to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers were ready to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published such accusations.
Portugal's Front and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorca in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep the incident a secret, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, said in a live Instagram live video to 142 million followers, hours after the claim was reported, and threw the report into "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
"What they say today, fake news," the winner of the five-time Ballingdor said in front of the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to have a reputation to say my name, but it's part of the job.
"I'm a very happy and good person," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, which they have called "responsible reporting in suspicious privacy areas," Reuters reports.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said athletes will seek compensation for "practical damage in quantities consistent with the weight of such infringements, which may be one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years."
Such alleged incidents are said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mallorca were reported back to the athletic room where he allegedly raped her rectally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mallorca claimed that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told her that he "99 percent" was a "good man" by missing "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo insisted they had sex, but it consented.
Mallorca also claimed she had gone to the police and had taken photographs of the trauma at the hospital, but later agreed to mediate outside the courtroom because she felt "fear of reciprocity" and was concerned about "the public embarrassment".
34-year-old says she's now looking for a way to overturn the settlement as she's still shocked by the incident.
Ronaldo is going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged harassment, and this summer moved to Italian giant Juve with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ to lose car manufacturer
UK “will regret forever” if it loses global leadership status in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Greg Greg, business secretary.
He added that it was "very worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without an agreement at all, it would result in a temporary halt to production at a factory in Burnaston, near Darby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clarke.
Japan’s car maker says border delays in Brexit could lead to job losses
The Burnaston plant - which produced Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will see a halt to production in our factories," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers raised fears of leaving the EU with no agreement on how cross-border trade could be carried out, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close a small factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern associated with what the car maker said was the supply chain's risk in the event that Brexit had no agreement.
Toyota's production line is "just in time" with spare parts coming in every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It's impossible for Toyota to keep inventory in excess of one day at its Darbicher factory, the company said, and that's to stop production.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's check-in plan for future relations with the European Union was "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We must have some agreement. We want to have the best deal to make as I say, not only will the present success succeed to happiness, but for us to seize this opportunity," he said to today's BBC Radio 4.
"Not only Toyota but other manufacturers, we have to continue with a highly successful supply chain."
Toyota can't tell how long production will stop, but in the long run, it warns that rising costs will ultimately reduce the factory's competitiveness and job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston for 24 years and was a senior union leader at the factory, said that his members became increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs went away, they would never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We are pushing forward precise and credible plans for future relations with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump's high stakes meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may have been "one week pushed away" as the fight to continue as nominee for Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh continued, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election intervention. The link between Trump's assistant to Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fired the assistant attorney general, which in turn would endanger Mueller's independence, fueled a months-long Washington fire of gossip.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing putting on a device to record Trump's conversations and the possibility of withdrawing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected such a report.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid reports that he was about to submit a resignation letter.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said he "liked more than not" expelled Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Kavanaugh and a woman accused him of sexual misconduct, both of whom, Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation a week of calls against Cavanaugh, delaying the entire Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "The date for the matter has not yet been determined, it could be this week, so I can see that pushing away one week is up to something else that is happening to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep up with the media."
Some news reporters would argue that confirmation: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Saunders said that no press conference was caused by the disgust "to seek attention from the audience" of the TV Reporter, although she said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they seek attention from the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"This president held more questions-and-answer sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding without claiming evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
The press conference will continue, Sanders said, but "if the media has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that would be more than acceptable to come and talk to me.
We've been trying to do that a lot, and you've seen how much we've done over the past few weeks and that's going to happen in a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump receives frequent questions when he leaves the White House, or during open meetings or media conferences.
Solitary media conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may demonstrate the cause by creating a bizarre, occasional and independent presence, ignoring any preconceived preconceived rules before gathering news reporters.
The Health Minister wrote to the European Union workers at NHS Scotland about fears over Brexit.
The Health Minister has written a letter to European Union officials working in the NHS of Scotland to express their country's gratitude and to bless them as it was the same after the Brexit story.
Scottish parliamentarian Jean Freeman sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK to withdraw from the European Union.
The Scottish Government is committed to the cost of applying for EU citizenship.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "This summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union about the withdrawal have continued, leading to a decision expected this fall.
But the UK government has begun preparations for a possible no-deal situation.
I knew this would be a terrifying moment for all of you.
That's why I now reiterate how much I value the participation of all staff members, no matter what nationality they are.
Partners from across the European Union and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen public health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to be here a lot."
Christion Abercrombie enters emergency surgery after a head injury
The Tennessee Tigers' Christion Abercrombie Linebacker took emergency surgery after a head injury on Saturday that beat Vanderbilt Commodores to 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the halftime break.
"He came to the boundary and collapsed there," said Reed.
The trainer and medical personnel provided oxygen to Abercrombie at the boundary before putting him on the stretcher and bringing him back for further assessment.
An officer from Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in the city of Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there had "never been any details about the type/ severity of the injury in this episode" and that Tennessee was trying to find a way out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie senior redshirt was in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He earned a total of five tackles on Saturday before having to leave the game, which made his entire season making the tag-team 18 times.
International Buyers Will Be Collecting Higher Stamp Duty When They Buy UK Assets
Foreign buyers are subject to higher stamp duty when they purchase assets in the UK with additional cash that will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plan.
Such a move would counter Corbin's successful move to persuade young voters.
Stamp duties are charged to non-taxable UK individuals.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to collect up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will begin to be charged a higher stamp duty when they purchase assets in the UK - with additional cash that will be used to help homeless people. Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbin’s drive to attract young voters with increased promise of affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
Stamp duties are charged to individuals and non-tax companies in the UK with extra pay to boost the government's fight against heavy sleep.
Additional funds - in addition to the current stamp duty, including higher levels, were introduced two years ago in the second house, and rental purchases - could be as high as three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the following to raise up to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of newly-built London assets are purchased by non-British residents, pushing prices up and making first-time buyers harder to own.
Many rich areas of the country - especially the capital - have already become a "ghost city". Because many foreign buyers will spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people make their first home easier.
He accused a large construction company of pulling property prices high by snatching up land, but did not exploit it and urged Mrs. May to give up quotas in affordable housing to fix "the embarrassment on Britain's housing".
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of eyewitnesses to the proposed housing reform, including the lease control and the termination of "no guilty" Ronan rights.
He also wanted to increase the council's power to build a new house.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to the restoration of the British dream - that this life should be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our ruined housing market.
England is always open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
Like a foreign company to buy a house like a hard-working British resident.
As for many people, their dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the burden of sleep remains forever. ”
Jack Ross: 'My highest ambition is to manage the Scottish administration'.
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "highest ambition" was to become the Scottish executive manager during a period of time.
The 42-year-old Scottish man is enjoying the challenge of resurrecting North-East, who is now sitting in third place in League One, three points away from number one.
He moved to the Scottish Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership the previous season.
"I want to play for my country as one player.
I got a "B" hat and it was just that," Ross told the Sportshound of BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it was a special thing that kept me coming back.
Yet that opportunity comes if I succeed in running the club."
Some of Ross' previous Sundance managers included Dick Adphogat, David Mies, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keene, Gus Poyet and Paul DiCaprio.
Former head Alloa Athletic said he wasn’t afraid to follow the names of the club’s founders, having previously rejected a call from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"A success for me will now be measured by 'Can I take this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities at this club, there is absolutely no doubt that it belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It wouldn't be easy to get there, but I'd consider myself a success here if I could get the club there."
Ross came into his managerial career just three years after a period as chief assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell in the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped revive Alloa from falling to the third tier and converted St. Meereen from almost falling to the top of the championship the following season.
Andross said he now feels more comfortable than when he had played in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It could be a real crossroads," he thinks of taking care of Alloa.
"I truly believe management is more appropriate for me than play.
It sounds weird because I'm well-educated, well-educated, and happy at a high level.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
I still struggle with stress and work pressure, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to run and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable I've ever felt on my own skin all my adult life."

Summer heat waves raise revenue for UK struggling pubs, but pressures for more restaurant networks.
The pub and bar group had a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but restaurant receipts fell 4.8 percent, the graph revealed.
CGA business consultant Peter Martin, who gathered the numbers, said: “The ongoing sunshine and Britain’s long-standing engagement in the World Cup means July has a similar pattern as in previous June. As the pub grew by 2.8 percent, except for the restaurants that were hit worse.
A 1.8 percent decline in restaurant sales in June was worse in July.
Strongest-ever drinks-focused pubs and bars with higher-revenue sales
Bad pubs in the sun, too, not so much as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out and get a drink.
Beverage sales of the pubs and bars that managed the overall management increased by 6.6 percent this month, with foodies dropping by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure time and RSM services, said: "These results are still a trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impacts of major social events or sports remain the biggest factor when discussing outdoor sales.
It’s no surprise that the restaurant sector will continue to struggle, although sales have fallen 4.8 percent year-on-year, especially painful, re-emerging ongoing cost pressures.
Even worse, food-and-time-focused practitioners will say whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will ease the demand."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new outlets, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in branding.
Coffer Peach Tracker monitors industry sales in the UK’s pubs, bars, and restaurants. It gathers and analyzes work data from 47 operations with a combined revenue of over 9 billion pounds and sets industry benchmarks.
One in five children have a secret social media account where they keep secrets from their parents.

A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of the "Insta Fake" page.
The news further raised fears that it was being posted sexual content.
Twenty-one percent of students said they had "primary" accounts to show to their parents.
One in five children — some as young as 11 — are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the account "Fake Instagram" - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site
The news further raised fears that it was being posted sexual content.
Twenty-one percent of students say they use a clean, "main" account to show their parents while also having a personal account.
One mother, who happened to pass by, saw the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, discovering that there was a teenager seduced by someone else to "rape me".
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the private school principals’ and female principals’ (HMC) conferences found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, half of which agree to maintain a personal account.
Head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It's an outrage that so many teenagers are lured into creating an online space where parents and teachers can't find it."
Eilidh Doyle will be "a voice for the athletes" on the board of directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the Board's Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most medal-winning track and field athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes this as a great opportunity for sports enthusiasts to benefit from her diverse international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has been highly respected by both Scotland, the UK and the World Athletics community, and we are confident that Scotland's athletics will benefit tremendously from her nomination to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to serve as a voice to the athletics and I hope I can actually participate and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta in total to four Olympic gold medals, and is now a frequent BBC Leg Specialist, was left unable to walk after suffering from a transient stroke.
He posted on Twitter: "A month ago, today I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
Doctors say there's only time to tell if I'm going to recover or how much I can recover.
It's a very difficult job, but a full recovery. Learn how to walk, and today is practicing agility!
Thank you for the encouraging message, sir!"
Advertise breast pumps, compare mothers and cows, share opinions online
The companies at the milking parlor have divided online comments with advertisements comparing breastfeeding to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the world's first "worn milk pump" consumer technology company Elvie, releases ads inspired by serious amusing music videos to show the freedom that a new pump can give to expressive mothers.
Four real mothers danced in a hay-filled cowhouse to a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking my own milk, but you don't see my tails," and, "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't milk (animals), they're my breasts."
The petition continues: "Put it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them to babies, pump it out, I'm milking my chicks."
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused online disputes.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed responses from spectators, many of whom said it looked like a "fear" of the dairy industry.
"The bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to conceive and give birth to milk, except for their babies that have been stolen from them within a few days of birth, one has written.
The Elvie breast pump fits perfectly into the lactating bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another commented: "It's a wound in the mind that's understandable for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them in advertising that pumps milk for mothers who have their babies."
Others add: "What a mindless advert."
Others set out to defend the ad, with one woman admitting that she thought the song was "unmusical".
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'll find one if I'm still breastfeeding.
The pumping makes me feel like a real cow.
It's a little crazy to advertise, but that's what I consider it.
This is a genius product," another wrote.
Another commented: "This is an entertaining commercial, focused on the widows at the milk pump (usually at work or in the bathroom) and feeling like a "cow".
This is not an ad that praises or judges the milk industry at all."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they are all dancing with where the milk pump is hidden in their bras.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the premise that many women at breast pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no strings or hose and fits perfectly in the lactating bra, giving girls the freedom to move around, carry their babies, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: “Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and stimulating opening.
We want to give milking and all its challenges stand out while demonstrating how fun and accessible it is.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers appeared on the catwalk to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were quietly taken to camps with tents on the Texas border.
The number of incarcerated migrant children has increased dramatically, although crossing the border each month remains relatively unchanged, partly due to verbal persuasion and harsh policies proposed by Trump's administration making it increasingly difficult to place children with patrons.
Traditionally, most patrons are self-inflicted immigrants and are afraid of risking their ability to live in the country by grabbing a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential donors and other adult members of their families would be required to submit fingerprints, and that information would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, a senior official with immigration and import duties told the U.S. Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying to be minor patrons alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the patrons or household members of the patrons are here illegally in this country, and most of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to pursue these individuals," Mr. Albenz said.
To find out how to get the children through the process faster, officials proposed new rules that would require some children to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than 60 days earlier, according to the previous standards.
Many would appear through video conferences rather than come by themselves to beg for their legal status with judges on immigration matters.
Those considered to be unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
If the child remains in custody, they are more likely to be anxious or depressed, which could lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
Sponsors say that those concerns rise in larger venues such as Tornillo, a sign that struggling children are more likely to be overlooked due to their size.
They added that moving children to Tent City without sufficient time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their peers may cause a trauma in the mind that many are experiencing.
Syria says to U.S. ‘insulting forces’ France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mo’alem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s eight-year war.
Mo'alem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces are illegally based on Syria's land claims in the fight against terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They will have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Mo'alem insisted that the "war on terror is nearing its end" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more being withdrawn from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until we can clean up all of Syria" of terrorist groups and "illegal presence of foreigners."
The United States has more than 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a country devastated by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moallam said the conditions were acceptable for them to go back, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "the spread of unreasonable fears," which encouraged refugees to retreat.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're making it a political matter in what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The U.S. and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction assistance for Syria until a political agreement between Asad and the opposition ends the war.
UN envoys say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a combat zone on the stronghold of Idlib's last major rebel group has created a ludicrous opportunity for political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement turned large-scale attacks by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, which had three million residents.
However, Mo'alem stressed that the agreement had a "clear timeline" and expressed hope that military operations would target jihadists, including warriors from the al-Nusra line associated with al-Qa’ida, who "would be eliminated".
The first meeting of the new committee, consisting of the government and opposition members, is expected to draft the post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mo'alem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in such a committee, stating that the work of the jury should be restricted "to the review of the various articles of the present Constitution" and warning against intervention.
Why would Trump win the second quarter?
With that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless (as many free-thinking audiences may hope) that the prosecution and scandal will put an end to his presidency ahead of time.
In what no doubt is "the most remarkable epistemology of the president's position ever existed!"
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
As of 2014, the Primetime ratings had more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News had an average primetime audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" had the highest ratings, with 3.5 million viewers on the night of the big news report.
"This is a fire that people are being drawn to because it's not what we understand," said Neal Baer, who performed on ABC's "Designated Survivor," about the Secretary-General of the Cabinet who became president after the attack destroyed the parliament building.
Nell Scovell, the veteran writer and comedian of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She recalled taking a taxi ride in Boston prior to the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,' said Miss Scovell.
There is entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories that came out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families could meet again and the health of the global economy.
Non-listening is a luxury that only the most privileged audience can do.
Yet, it's more than just being a data-driven citizen when you find yourself spending six hours watching a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of the "deep background" as a resource for his "Fear" book, a 15000 dollar ostrich-leather jacket, Paul Manafort's "thick clothes," says the Washington Post), and the implication of Stormy Daniels' shocking description to, uh, Mr.
I don't look at the same Super Marios anymore.
"A part of what he does to make it feel like a reality show is he's feeding you every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about circulating actors of Trump's show and daily twists (hitting with NFL star Kim Jong-un).

When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny, 80 degrees outside his house on the northern shore of Kawai Island, but he was obsessed inside, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not have peeled himself off, not by having Brett Cavanaugh aim to face the Senators Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court who are uncertain of going any way.
"I remember when we even made those terrible shows in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,"" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

the Central Elections '
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th place is seeing a surge of money because of the redistricting of Congress, which puts the two incumbents in the same seat.
Recently, the newly-drawn suburban Pittsburgh district created a scuffle for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won a chair in another district last spring special election.
Lamb is competing with Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the 12th district, old Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The plan was redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old county had an unfairly advantageous electoral divide, you and the Republican.
The new 17th district race sparked a financial battle to campaign between key financial groups, the Democratic-Parliamentary Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in the state of Pennsylvania after a shrewd win in the widely watched March special election for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The seat was occupied for more than a decade by the Republican and President Donald Trump won in the district by a margin of 20 votes.
Political experts gave Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States, weighing El Salvador's punishment over its support to China, then retreating.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and there was a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump's management team.
State Department officials decided to call back American diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on "the latest decision not to accept Taiwan anymore," said Heather Noert, the ministry's spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
But there's only a judicial hearing on El Salvador, where about $140 million was aided in helping Americans in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic support.
Proposed penalties, including reduction of financial aid and limiting targeted visas, can be painful for this Central American country, as well as the country's high unemployment and murder rates.
As the meeting progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity following a similar rally last year seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent U.S.-led migration.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to go ahead, effectively ending El Salvador's sanctions.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to attend the conference, which is now scheduled to take place in mid-October, as a sign of the importation of administrative facilities in the gathering, diplomats said.
And three American diplomats quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no message or any kind of harsh punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three such American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the terms of anonymity.
Their account was confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke of a condition of non-disclosure of the name.
Educational Background
The next pair of shoes to fall may have been Robert Mueller's report, a special advisor to Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which now contains much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller was also reported to have turned his investigation over whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in an attack on our election.
If the U.S. Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will face his responsibilities, just as he prepares to waive again in front of voters and may eventually be a jury of his comrades.
And I don't mean to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable -- and what's equivalent to him in Europe.
There are choices we all must make by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, which results in how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German authorities were ready to execute Hitler's coup if only the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed and missed the opportunity to avoid bloodshed over the years.
The historical trajectory revolves around that turning point, and the unstoppable march of democracies has been accelerated or delayed.
Americans face these turning points now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water ever since this paper reported last year that he said of sneaking the President's recordings and predicted that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times' account was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I. inquiry that requests Bret Cavanaugh's re-examination is not complete or fair – or if he confirms to the Supreme Court even if there are credible allegations of sexual harassment and false statements?
And above all, can we vote in midterms for Congress to give Mr. Trump an explanation?
If we fail in those tests then democracy will fall to a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and in the next 60 years sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table marked with a swastika.
With that being my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, is the Chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers was optimistic ahead of the clash in Vienna.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing victory over the Austrians. After an impressive draw in Spain against Biyarreal earlier this month, it put them in a strong position to pass the qualifiers from the Group G of Europa League.
A knee injury forced the midfielder Graeme Dorrans to not make his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Biyarreal, but he believed that Rangers could use the results of the match as a leaping key to something greater.
"It's one good score for us because Biyarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went down the game by believing that we might get something and get one score.
Maybe we were hoping a little too much at the end, but overall, being consistent is a good result.
They might be better in the first half and we come out in the second half and on the better side.
Going into Thursday, it's another great European night.
Hopefully, we’ll be able to grab three points, but that’s a tough game because they’ve done well in their latest game.
It's been a tough year for everything that's happened with my injury and club changes.
The good team and the boys enjoyed it a lot, good training.
Hopefully, we'll be able to fight now, leave the previous season behind and succeed."
Girls can't sleep because they're worried about saving for retirement.
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke with their family members on the matter.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were speaking to spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't do the conversation process," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is the beginning.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't tell your wishes beforehand.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss facility and care options.
Bring your financial advisors in: Your consultants can help you figure out how to handle those costs.
Alternatives to preparing your funds for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance policies. Hybrid cash value life insurance policies to help cover these costs or insurance yourself with your own wealth – as long as you have money.

Multiple earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami in Palu, Indonesia on Friday, officials said. The number of deaths is expected to rise.
With the communication going down, the relief staff could not get any information from the Donggala office, the northern area of Palau closer to the point above the 7.5-magnitude earthquake center.
In Palu, there are more than 16,000 refugees after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is an office that stretches along the coast more than 300 km (180 miles) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The provincial office, which is a smaller administrative district, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic activities in central Sulawesi, especially on the coast of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in such provinces, but most are concentrated at Morovali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami struck Donggala West in 1996, killing nine people.
the Pacific Fire Ring of the Pacific Ocean
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake hit the west coast of Ajjah, Indonesia, north of Sumatra, on December 26. It triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of Ajjah’s people.
2005: Several severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Magnitude 6.8 struck the southernmost island of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern seaboard, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the western capital of Sumatra near the city of Padang.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake strikes the Pidie Jaya office in Ajjah, causing destruction and panic when people are reminded of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There have been no tsunamis this time, but more than 100 people have died from the collapsed buildings.
2018: A major earthquake hit Indonesia’s offshore wind island, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
This earthquake temporarily destroyed thousands of buildings and trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Plin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Plin, has already been charged with assault.
Ploen, 29, of Vasylla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. Passing on domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to police, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report such an alleged crime, he grabbed her phone out of her.
Pelin is currently being held in the premises prior to Mat-Su's trial and is bailed with an unsecured loan of $500, reported by KTTU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, certainly not guilty", when being asked about his complaint, reported by the Associated Press.
Pelin faces several Class A felony counts, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B felony with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time a criminal case has been filed against Pelin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Plin.
His mother, Sarah Plin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
This case is now in front of Alaska's Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with reporting domestic violence crimes, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with PTSD caused his involvement in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, with more deaths expected in the coming days.

Hundreds of people gathered to hold a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Central prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Zeefullo Cipov, a suspect in a New York City terrorist attack that killed up to eight people – a rare punishment that has not happened in such a state for a crime imposed by U.S. law since 1953.
Cypov, 30, was accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle path along the westbound highway in lower Manhattan, sweeping over pedestrians and cyclists on his route on October 30.
In order to achieve the death penalty, prosecutors had to prove that Cypov "intentionally" killed eight victims and that "intentionally" caused severe physical injury, based on a declaration of intention to seek the death penalty, sent documents in southern New York.
Both of those charges could have the death penalty, based on court documents.
Several weeks after the incident, a federal grand jury slapped Cypov with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder in assisting in fraud, which are generally used by federal prosecutors in criminal enterprise cases, and for violence and the destruction of multiple motor vehicles.
Such an act must have "a great deal of planning and contemplation", prosecutors said, explaining the manner in which Cypov carried out the act as being in an "evil, cruel and unethical manner".
"Sayfillo Habibullah Avig Zipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
the Southern District of New York
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two couriers, but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used on the New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the spouses who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit sabotage to the Soviet Union two years earlier in the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg's family were executed with electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
Cypov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in several days and months after the uprising, said, according to court documents.
He stated to the interrogator that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Cypov told authorities he was inspired to launch an attack after watching several ISIS videos on his phone, based on the prosecution.
He has also asked to show ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the civil rights defenders representing Cypov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than admittance to pleading for life in prison without release will only prolong the trauma in the minds of all these incidents to all those involved," Patton said.
Cypov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given the duty of negotiating Brexit.
Nigel Farage vowed to 'move the masses' today during a protest at the Tory Assembly.
Former leader of the UK Independence Party, said politicians must 'feel the heat' of the anti-EU concept – as one of the parliamentarians of Theresa May himself has proposed that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative Peter Boone backbencher says the march in Birmingham says the United Kingdom should be 'out' now if Farage is Brexit secretary.
But the challenge she faced in her deeply divided team was lined up by the Remain Tories, who took part in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers fixation plan out of the way amid attacks from the Brexit, the Remain and the European Union.
The allies insisted she would push forward in an effort to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite that strong backlash – and forced anti-EU ideas and workers to choose between her package and ‘fraud’.
Mr. Boone said the dismissal meant to rally off in Solihull that he wanted to 'throw the Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be appointed as a colleague and given responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
‘If he had been in charge, we would have left by now,’ he said.
Parliamentary member Wellingborough added: 'I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to throw away the Chequers.'
A statement against his European Union objections, he said: 'We are not fighting a world war in order to surrender.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr Boone dismissed the proposal that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to be the same is not true at all.'
Andrea Jenkyns, the Tory Brexiters, is also on the march. Reporter: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are not popular with the general public. The opposition will not vote for it. It is not popular with our party and our activists who actually go down the road and get us elected in the first place.
Please put the Checkers down and start listening.'
In a statement to Ms. May, she added: 'The Prime Ministers were able to keep their jobs when they kept their promises.'
Mr Farage said politicians must 'feel the heat' if they are going to betray their decision in the 2016 referendum.
‘Now it is a matter of trust between us – people – and our political elite,' he said.
‘They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'We're not going to let you get away by doing that.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class who are about to betray Brexit feel that heat.
'We are mobilizing the peoples of this country who have triumphed over us in Brexit, and there will be no holidays until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the Remain marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
The know-how of the movement's snakes waved to the Tories against the Brexit flag after the group's debut this weekend.
The labor nobles, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the conservative party for the security issues they faced on the party's app when the meeting opened.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can have a complete IT system and all the technologies for Canada plus a positive for the irresistible borders for borderless free trade in Ireland,’ he added.
'It's a total joke.
There's nothing a good Brexit can do," he added.
Warren plans to 'starve' in running for president.
U.S. Elizabeth Warren, a senator, said she would "look intently at the presidential runoff" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a meeting at the Massachusetts Municipal Office West Saturday.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against state representative GOP Geoff Diehl, who is co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been a center of speculation that she may contend with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Hollyoaks was her 36th meeting with Democratic citizens using the Town Hall format since Trump took office.
The attendee asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied, "It's time for these women to go to Washington to fix our ruined government, and that includes the women who are on top."
Arrested shooting kills Sims of LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced on Saturday that one of the suspects had been arrested in connection with a shooting that killed basketball player LSU Wayne Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man they saw in the video clip.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the University Southern area early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died," Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the press last Saturday with 247sports.
Wayde walks in to protect his friend and is shot by Simpson.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton draws to world rankings after team sends him to victory over Sebastián Fettles.
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas passed the selection before ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team would go on to compete in most of the races.
From the pole, Bottas started well and almost let Hamilton wait until the withers as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel entered the pits first and let Hamilton run into the pack.
Mercedes made one lap later and fell behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtaken the front after a brawl that saw the Ferrari drivers hesitate to let the insiders risk a re-position after two moves to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid grid and was ranked seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then went on to take the lead mainly in the race as he held on to his rubber tights to aim for a goal to reach the finish line quickly and Zangkimi Ryōnen to become fourth.
He finally entered the pits in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds as Réconne took fourth place.
It was a hard day because Valtteri did a great job over the weekend and was a real gentleman who told me to go with him.
The team has done such a wonderful job to get a series punch," Hamilton said.
That's really bad body language.
U.S. President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday where she insisted she had not unwrapped a letter from Christine Blaisey Ford accusing Brett Cavanaugh of being nominated as a member of the Supreme Court for sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in the state of West Virginia, the president did not mention directly in Ford's statement in front of a Senatorial committee, instead expressing the opinion that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "very narrow-minded and disgusting and unfaithful."
"One of the things that can happen, and the beautiful things that are happening during the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and narrow-minded and disgusting and unfaithful," he said.
"When you watch the press release and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the leak?
Remember her answer... did you release the leaked documents? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't let the leak."
All right, wait a minute.
We let the leaks or not... no, we didn't let the leaks," he said, supplemented by a mockery of the senator's gestures.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Cavanaugh by Ford back in July. And it had leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied the leak from her office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's accusations, I'm not releasing news of her story," Feinstein told the board, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as secret as she asked."
But her rejection didn't seem to please the president, who commented during Saturday night's gathering: "What can I tell you?
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to protect his nominees for the Supreme Court, who were accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested Democrats use the allegations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the narrowness, the disgustingness, they don't care who gets hurt, who they have to trample on to gain power and control," Mediaite reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer fumbled two goals to the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars washed their eyes to defeat the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning in a 5-3 draw with Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took a two point lead ahead of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Clownie always take home the lead before Dwyer regains the Giants lead.
Francois Bouchard always made it to Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen would make the closed door grab the win.
It was a defeat in the Elite League, the third of the season, for the man of the late Adam Keefe to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth encounter of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning three previous championships.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFall backing David Rutherford providing the backing, while Beauvillier scored a two point lead four minutes later.
At the start of the messy mash, Sullivan brought home the home team to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt became the scorer for the Clownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants scored the lead in the first brake when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard once again brought the team up with a powerful 27:37 minute score.
Clownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen make Dundee the first lead in the match in the second period, and he made sure to win by the team's fifth score in the halfway point of the final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, have returned home to Milton Keynes in the next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers martyred to ensure hundreds of people on board the plane could escape from the earthquake.
Indonesia’s air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after his death to ensure a plane carrying hundreds of people flew safely off the ground.
Over 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Aftershocks continue to intensify within the area and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues' escape to survive, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his role in the tower that severely swayed Muteira Cis Al Jufray, Palu's airport.
He was present to conduct an inspection to ensure that the Batik 6321 aircraft, which was on the runway at the time, could safely be flown on board.
He then jumps out of the flight control tower when he thinks he's about to crash.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian air ministry spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could save hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We're preparing a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to another larger hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken upon hearing this," he added.
At the same time, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with national aid agencies saying access to Dongala, Sigi and Boutong were restricted.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise as more bodies are still under rubble, while more remains remain unreachable," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
A wave of up to six meters has destroyed Palu, which will organize mass burials on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in a body.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being searched all over."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to rescue survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the work involved in the evacuation.
Are you guys ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia earlier this year was hit by an earthquake in the island of Lompoc, killing more than 550 people.
"Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea now says one man missing after plane crashes into lake".
The airline, which provides flight services to the Pacific Lake in Micronesia, now said a man was missing, after earlier said all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a press release that on the afternoon of Saturday, it could not comment on male passengers.
The airline said it was working with local government agencies, hospitals, and investigators to try and find the man.
The airline does not respond to further requests about such passenger immediately, such as his age or nationality.
Local boat rescued other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Authorities said Friday there were seven people being hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital Saturday, and all were in danger.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events is not clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane had landed in a lake with a short runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was running beyond the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came down very low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others could wade through waist-deep water to emergency exits on a sunken plane.
He said the flight attendant panicked and yelled at him, and he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy says crews working nearby to improve the jets also assist with the use of an inflated boat to pick-up and drop people ashore before the plane sinks to about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Aviation safety network data indicates 111 people have been killed in the crash of an airline registered with PNG over the past two decades, but none of them are associated with Air New Guinea.
The anarchists frame the timeline of the Night's women burned alive.
The prosecution ended on Saturday in an appeal of a man accused of burning a Mississippi state girl as a whole in 2014.
Donald Trump, U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett, was staying for hours as an expert witness for intelligence analysis.
He concluded with the jury how he used cell phone records to coordinate the movements of the 29-year-old defendants, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, who were the victims on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location information from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with the Chamber on the evening of her death, which contradicted his previous claim, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the information showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' at a time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford boarded Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers's death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He removed her from his life," said Hale.
The defense was timed to begin shutting down the argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to reach a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
Trio Hip-Hop wanted to challenge the negative aspects of the genre by filling positive messages into their songs.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop moves away from its origins in being a political message and tackles social problems.
They want to return to their original roots and make Hip-Hop conscious again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen the recent resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
Nanny N.Y. sued the couple after the dismissal after a "serious racist" message.
The New York Nanny is suing the couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message sent wrongly by the mother who complains that she is "another black person".
They both denied that they were racists, calling the petition an act of extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed shock at the discovery that Giselle Maurice, the new child care provider, was a black man on the first day of work in 2016.
"No, no, no. Another black man," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs Maurice twice.
After realizing her rudeness, the "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that their socially-loving nanny, who was African-American, did a bad job, and she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now suing a couple to compensate for the dismissal and is seeking compensation for a fine of $350 a day for six months.
"I want to show them, see, you don't do anything like that," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple sued, claiming that they were racist, that ending Maurice's employment was a reasonable thing to do, fearing that they would not be able to trust her after committing a crime against her.
"My wife sent something to her that she didn't intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But will you put your child in the hands of someone you're rude to, even if it's a mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on."
The apparition was like a "exorcism", Plasco said his wife had just given birth to a baby of two months and was in "a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to commit to someone like that?
That's not a good thing," added Vanichthanakorn.
While legal cases continue, the Court of Public Opinion has immediately condemned this couple on social media, beating them in their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid readers wouldn't understand the bear's talking.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after this book was accepted, said of such a letter: "It's hard to put our attention on someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
Saying that her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before, was inspired to write a children's book with a small toy bear, would have been cheerful at his work being rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "sweet, bitter" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she adds that her father is proud of the achievement that quietly happened in the end.
"He's a pretty quiet guy, and he's not a boastful guy," she said.
"But since Paddington is so real to him, it's almost as if you have a successful child something: you're proud of them, even if it's not really your act.
I think he's looking at Padington's success that way.
Even if it was his creation and imagination, he would always give credit to the Paddington itself."
My daughter's dying and I have to say goodbye over the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was sent to the hospital Louis Pasteur II of Nice, where doctors worked to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and she didn't expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad to say she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tachi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll stay with her.
The pharmacist had given her to keep her heart pumping, slowly slowing down and leaving her system.
She died a while ago, and this is when it all shut down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing this was coming out.
I can't snore or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold on to it."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is now grieving the loss of her daughter, gets on a plane with other passengers - has no idea what the pain she is going through is.
"No one knows," she said.
"I bowed my face down, and tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's on this flight that I feel the overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her."
The grieving woman posted a card to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from self-sabotaging.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have attached cards to the Wales Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler was 13 years old, the son of Miss Davis, when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I have to feel these days," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a future cook with a reciprocal smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always say his smile illuminates any room."
However, he collapsed before he died, as he "was in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he had ended his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I was constantly worried that there would be a knock in the impact."
Ms. Davis has created a card "to let the know that there are people out there that you can go to and you can talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't sit quietly - you've got to talk."
Ms. Humphrey, who had been friends with the young Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt bad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact with the kids or anything."
She said his death was a major wound to them, but they had to go through it: "It ripped a hole through the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to stand up and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is uncertain of which direction once the FBI begins the investigation.
"I think, if we can get something like what he really asked for - the investigation is limited by time, in scope - we may bring a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee "breaks into jeopardy" amid the mounting of tight-knit parties.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance comes from timelines.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away on November 6th - if so, as expected. The Republicans did not do well. They are significantly weaker in their efforts to get the people they want elected to the Supreme Court in the land.
George W. Bush picked up a phone call to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush, and through him he met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes a report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently in office.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate floor, which would have forced Mike Penzance, the Vice President, to withdraw from the presidency, and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'falling' under Kim
The number of North Korean converts to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers say.
Park Byung-seug, with reference to data from South Korea's Department of International Relations, said that there were 1,127 offshore conversions in the previous year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border control between North Korea and China and higher smuggling rates are a key factor.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
Most of the North's converts will eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a military-free zone (DMZ) with tight defenses between the two Koreas.
China considers pacifists more illegal immigrants than refugees, often forcing repatriation.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have significantly improved over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss, focusing on negotiations for a cease-fire.
This comes after a historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when they agreed on broad terms to enter the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho condemned the U.S. sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there would be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there would be no single disarmament," he said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "a tyrant," saying he was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the council, called the nominee as a Supreme Court member Brett Cavanaugh "a tyrant" and said that he was inappropriate because there was an emotional variance to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if women acted out that way, they would say 'likely to strike up the pieties'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Cavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh denied the allegations emotionally that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaisey-Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost yelling out and choking while talking about his family and high school life.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusation against him as a "massive and cohesive character killing" that was organized by the angry liberal Hillary Clinton defeated in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Cavanaugh's statement has proved he cannot serve the Supreme Court because it shows he has prejudiced the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the pattern of how he beat Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi doubted when asked if she would try to sue Cavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to be in the Supreme Court, but also included in the courts where he is now," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge on the court, appeals to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's decision that might lead to the Health Systems Reform Act (ACA) or the Roe v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative justice.
In listening to his confirmation, Cavanaugh avoided questioning whether he would flip some of the Supreme Court's verdicts.
"It's not the time for the tyrants and prejudices to go to court and expect us to say, 'How wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to be armed.
It's a righteous criticism, months and years of overwhelming rage, and she can't speak out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She went on to say, "I've been so helped by some executive woman who says she's crying when she's angry, but has developed a technique that means that when she's angry and starts crying, she's going to say to the person she's saying, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I think that's fantastic."
Tears are allowed as a solution for anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories from my first job at work, where a man stands out, where I once found myself crying in unexplainable anger. I was grabbed at the top of my neck by an older woman - a cool manager who I was always afraid of - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see you're crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad as firewood.
They think you're sad and will be delighted because they beat you."
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship named Monkey Business and bowed out of the race, a deeply disappointed Ms. Schroeder thought there was no reason why she should not explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It's not a well-thought-out decision," she said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they want is another one.
Some call it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because at the end of the campaign, she's behind fundraising, so she swears she won't participate in the race unless she raises $2 million.
It's a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters gave her $1,000, with men giving her only $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" she wondered.
When she made the speech, she announced that she would not launch an official campaign. She was overwhelmingly emotionally – grateful for the people who would support her. The frustration with the system made it difficult to raise funds and target voters, other than representatives and people who were angry about sexism – that made her choke.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder thought of how the media responded to her.
"You would think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my gravestone?
"Are you crying?"
How China-U.S. Trade War Affects Beijing
The opening of the trade war between the U.S. and China is alarming, and while the fighting is far from over, the cracks between many countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump first fired a warning earlier this year, charging China's major export taxes, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important upgrade came this week with a new tariff on goods totaling $200 billion (£150 billion) effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has had to retaliate each time similarly. Lastly, slapped the customs duties at the rate of 5 to 10 percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has pledged to fight the U.S. on-the-fly, and the world's second-largest economy is not blinking at any time.
Washington's weakening meant a dramatic reduction in demand, but the U.S. bow to the public was too humiliating for China's president Xi Jinping.
Despite this, experts say that if Beijing is able to play its cards correctly, the U.S. trade war pressure can support China in the long run by reducing cross-border dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that rapid political decisions made in both Washington and Beijing can create conditions that start economic control in both countries is actually much more dangerous for previously-recognized observers," said Abigail Grace, co-author of Asia-focused research at the Center for New American Security, a brainwashed working group.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria said it was ready for voluntary resettlement and asked for help in rebuilding the seven-year-old war-torn country.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Walid Almoalem, the Foreign Minister, said that the situation within the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions now exist for voluntary repatriation of refugees from acts of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and lifestyles.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The remaining six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Almoalem said Syria's regime will welcome aid for the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it would not accept assistance with conditions or assistance from countries that support such an act of insurrection.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six matches in a row on the European soil and hasn't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown, as Denmark's captain Thomas Byrne's team scored to 14.5 points as they needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled mostly in the tournament, hit his tee-off into the water at the 16th par-3 hole, giving up his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his championship rounds by becoming one of four players who made a 5-0-0 draw since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by Denmark's lowest ranked European team Thorbjorn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the world's top players, made 2 and 1 for Ian Poulter of England who might have played in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who had eight Ryder Cup experiences, became the top European tournament winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So thank you for Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy. I'm so happy to have the cup back.
It's a team thing, and I'm glad I can help," said the overwhelmingly emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed over the torch to fellow U.S. golf legend John Rams, who defeated Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I felt to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a career record in the Ryder Cup, 13-21-3.
Weird statistics by one of the greatest players of all time by winning 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled every weekend to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finney, who played top golfers throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, Captain of the United States, said after a disappointing play for his team, "I'm proud of them. They're finished fighting.
There's some time this morning that we're making Europe hot.
We're scraps now.
Praise Thomas.
He was a brilliant captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup board and we will move on.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to serve as captain.
You must accept
We've been better played."
Red tide update: concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in the concentration of the Redwater range for some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there have been reports of plentiful flowering conditions in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties - which indicate a decrease in concentration.
The flowers range in red water for about 130 miles from the coast from Pinellas north to Lee County south.
It can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboro County, but it's less common than last week.
Redwater's range is also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas County have been reported in recent weeks. Low concentrations to high off the coast of Hillsboro County, background concentration to high in Manatee County, background concentration to high in or off the coast of Sarasota County, background concentration to high in Charlotte County, background concentration to high in or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentration in Collier County.
Irritation of the respiratory tract is still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida during the past week.
