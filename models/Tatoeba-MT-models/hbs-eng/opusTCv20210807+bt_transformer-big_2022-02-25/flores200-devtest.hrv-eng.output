This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but details that fossils usually do not provide, e.g. color and three-dimensional layout, are enabled.
. Scientists claim that the upper side of the feathers of this animal was maroon brown, and the lower side pale or carotenoid.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed pen blade called a rachis, but it does have other features of the plumage - ishermen of the 1st and 2nd orders - researchers have concluded that the pen blade probably originated later in evolution in relation to not that other feature.
According to the structure of the feathers, it can be concluded that it was not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or pointing. Researchers argue that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern shows the feathers of the color of adult specimens, not the fluff of the cubs.
Research has shown that despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern is part of the adult bird's plumage rather than the chicks' fluff.

In France, high technology is not traditionally used when voting: voters are isolated in cabins, where they insert a preprinted sheet of paper with the name of the chosen candidate into the envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs on the voter list.
The procedure is very strictly prescribed by the French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that at the beginning of voting there are no envelopes in them and no envelopes are added to them except those inserted by properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers with strict supervision count votes by following certain procedures.

She first performed in the slalom, where she failed to finish the first run. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her second, giant slalom race she finished in tenth place in women's sitting skiing with a combined time of 4:41.30 - 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Hungarian Gymngyi Dani.
Four skiers from the women's group failed to complete the course, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Grand slalom failed to make the race.
Madhya Pradesh state police found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people suspected of raping a Swiss woman and we have found her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.

Since then, Adekoya has been in the court of first instance in Edinburgh on charges of murdering his son.
In custody, she is awaiting indictment and trial, but there is a possibility that eyewitness evidence will be derivative as many media outlets have published a photo of her.
This is a common practice everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the judiciary in Scotland functions differently and the courts have found the publication of photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, said: “It seems like journalists are dancing on dangerous wire because of the publication of photographs and so on.”
The Crown Office, which handles all criminal proceedings, announced to reporters that it would not make further comments at least until the indictment was brought.
The document, according to the leaked information, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed reportedly include the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a continued military presence for ten years after the signing of the treaty, and the Palestinian Authority agrees with the military presence for only five years.
Test-hunting hunters with the aim of suppressing pests would be under the strict supervision of park guards who would monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the hunt.
Qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, as part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Australian Hunting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting park conservation and heritage director at the NPWS, the four shooters selected to perform the first kill operation received extensive safety guidelines and underwent training.
Martelly was sworn into the Interim Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday, which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth interim election council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission cited CEP's previous resignation as part of a package of measures towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, which were supposed to be held since 2011.
About 60 cases of faulty iPods have been reported overheating causing six fires and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
"Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry stated that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which for the company ""is not serious"". "
"The ministry called Apple's delay in the report 'really regrettable'."

Of the 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of the poll participants share the same view that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia’s last female ruler.
Twenty-nine percent said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said Australia should never become a republic.

No additional transportation will be organised, and overhead trains will not stop in Wembley. Also, parking facilities and parking and use of public transport at ground level will not be available.
Due to the fear of lack of transportation, the possibility arose that the match would have to be moved to closed without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed within just two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to a cross between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes and a newcomer from the finch genus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into all possible shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can be twisted and knitted. It can be typed with a hammer or rolled into planes.
"It can be very thin and stick to another metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted paintings in books called ""painted manuscripts""."
It's called chemical pH. Your indicator may be red cabbage juice.
Rasol changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the abbreviation pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are electron-free protons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).

In Harappa and Mohenju Dar, each house was equipped with at least one flush toilet that was connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the buildings of the Minean cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths in which both men and women were mixed in societies.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
Scientists in space use a telescope because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and view.
To send a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel brought unimaginable changes to the world. The biggest change was that the invention of the wheel allowed us to transport much easier and faster.

Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, many small cats (including house cats) eat much more abundant small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is in the concept of a niche, that is, a special position occupied by an individual cat, so it does not have to compete with others.
>>bos_Latn<< Lions are the most social cats that live in large groups called herds.
>>srp_Latn<< The lion packs consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a complete athlete, a tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump a great distance, and pull five times as hard as a man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (gender panther) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion, but more like a series of incomprehensible, shouted words.
Ocelots eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals that eat (prey) by smelling where the prey has been moving on the ground.
They see very well in the dark with the help of night vision and move very imperceptibly. Ocelots hunt prey so that they blend in with the environment, and then ambush the prey.
When a small group of living beings (small populations) are separated from the main population from which they came (for example, when crossing a mountain or river or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment.
The new environment means different resources and different competition, so the new population needs features or adjustments that differ from the previous ones in order to be able to compete for resources.
Originally the population has not changed at all, they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it becomes less and less like another population.
Over time, after thousands and even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that they will not be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and then take the carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants create food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
We make houses and clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
>>bos_Latn<< Mosasaur was the main predator in his time so he feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
His long jaw had more than 70 sharp teeth along with an extra set on his palate which meant there was no help for anyone who got in his way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a forked tongue. His diet consisted of turtles, big fish, and other mosasaurs, and there may have been cannibals.
He attacked everything that would get into the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex would not be his equal.
>>bos_Latn<< Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a number of unusual or unusual delicacies that included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and puffs.
Another difference was that the poor and the women ate sitting on chairs, while the rich men enjoyed communal feasts where they ate outstretched on their sides.
The rations of the ancient Romans could not contain the ingredients that arrived in Europe from America or Asia during the following centuries.
For example, they did not know corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered to be God's house.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by staging ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids formed towers, the so-called ziggurats, which were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the lives of Hebrew families took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were counters open to the road. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no great forests, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, with Norwegian sagas saying that after Erik Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, he discovered Greenland on his way west and named it after him.

"Although every country was ""Scandinavian"", there are many differences between people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it said ""The original Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776."" The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down."
No one knows for sure who wrote this large document on parchment (dimension 293–241 inches), but it is known that it was rolled up for storage shortly after it was made.
So, probably that record was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The attack is known as "Operation Dragoon". "
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated southern France and headed for Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together - society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and refers to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, which also determines the size of society in some way.
Cities-states are the forerunners of states. Civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation, a trace in culture and equal expansion.
Fewer cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, so we don't recognize them as true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, thirteen states by constitutional act Articles of Confederation first established a weak central government consisting only of congress.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, since there was no state or judicial authority, when implementing all acts it relied on competent authorities that often did not cooperate.
He also had no authority to overturn tax laws and customs between states.
The amendment of the Treaty required the unanimous consent of all states, and they did not take the central government seriously, so their representatives were most often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and were the champions at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions in which Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
"Since it consists of a cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view."
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors, while sailing along the island, wrote the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, “a beautiful island”.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan and initiated the transformation of Aboriginal practices in grain production and employed Chinese workers to work on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed an agreement in Shimonoseki that gave Japan sovereignty over Taiwan that ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intihuatan, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows Room.

For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main size of the film towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, the same ratio has image sensor formats in digital cameras.
The fact that the 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high is a bit confusing.
The ratio of width and height of this format (divided by twelve in order to obtain a ratio expressed by prime integers) is therefore 3 : 2.
Many common formats (for example formats from the APS group) are equal to or closest to this aspect ratio.
The rule of a third that is often broken and ridiculed is a simple guideline to create dynamism with a certain retention of order in the picture.
It states that the most effective place for the main object is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church became the subject of criticism.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has connected European countries that had different languages and customs.
The great power of Christianity affected everything from the king to the commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be applied to alleviate suffering and reduce poverty, and that the funds of the church exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they adhere to this principle.
Shortly after the outbreak of armed conflict, Great Britain began the naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy worked because it prevented German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in multiple international agreements over the last two centuries.
The UK has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, which has also caused danger for ships of neutral sides.
Since there was not too much interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the majority of citizens and people prevailed over pacifist attitudes and separation.
After experiencing horrors and atrocities during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the foreman at his previous workplace) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of depicting different time periods; every phase of China or every family that was in power was a recognizable dynasty.
Between each dynasty followed an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the epoch of the Three Kingdoms which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars between nobles took place in the battle for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China; thousands of people died fighting for the highest place in the great Xi'an Palace.
The consequences are social and political, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not the ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution employment was available to all men and the most ambitious and successful were given the chance to succeed.
The same applies to the military because after the revolution the acts were obtained on the basis of ability, not class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to launch their own revolution.
"Muhammad was very interested in issues beyond the limits of his boring life. A cave that became known as ""Hira"" on the mountain ""Noor"" (light) he visited so that he could think better."
The cave that has survived through history provides a clear picture of Muhammad’s spiritual values.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find it even if you know for sure that it exists. Once you find yourself in a cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exist.
The Pyramid of Cheops, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many large pyramid buildings built in honor of the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Kufu, and a multitude of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of the wives of Pharaoh Kufu and members of his family.
"The mark ""move with bow up"" looks like a V a ""move with bow down"" like a staple or square without a bottom page."
The sign for up means that you should start from the top and push the bow, and the sign for down means that you should start from the frog (where we hold the bow by hand) and pull the bow.
>>srp_Latn<< A raised bow usually creates a softer sound, while a lowered bow is more powerful and intrusive.
Feel free to add your own tags, but remember that the bow movement tags are printed for musical reasons, so they should usually be adhered to.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Elizabeth were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats to the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a mob member in front of a horrified queen swung the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles.
>>srp_Latn<< The wartime expenditures of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to settle much of the cost, and interest on bonds was changed through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-gain resulting from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos will constitute the basic gain of American imperialism.
>>bos_Latn<< To understand the Templars we need to understand the context in which order originated.
The era of these events is commonly referred to as the developed Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 to 1300 C.E.).
The developed Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages which by convention end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological stimulus or the technological imperative to the strict understanding that human destiny is guided by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely above cultural or political influence, and that technology has “effects” on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the invention of cars necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country is not worth it for just a few cars, so new ways of production have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars leads to more road accidents, leading to the discovery of new techniques in health care to treat injuries.
>>bos_Latn<< In Romanticism there was a strong element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, customs and culture related to geography appear that are in harmony with the physical residence of society, and are therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris is known as the capital of modern-day fashion, Kostantinopol was considered the capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as the epicenter of luxury from 400 AD to approximately 1100 AD.
The status deteriorated in the twelfth century largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that had greater value than that offered by the Byzantine market.
At this time, the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style was in the period from the 10th to the 11th century and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to slow communication, styles in the west fell behind by 25 to 30 years each.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest discoveries of the time as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons on clothing.
Self-supply farming is agriculture to produce sufficient quantities of food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-supply farming is a simple and often organic system that uses seeds indigenous to ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers engaged in self-supply farming, which is still true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel neglected by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
>>srp_Latn<< Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture special can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of the subculture often show their belonging by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the methods by which the importance of socialization is most often illustrated is to cite examples of unfortunate cases of children who did not pass socialization by adults during adulthood, either as a result of neglect, accident or intentional abuse.
Such children are called uncultivated or wild. Some wild children are imprisoned by people (most often their own parents). In some cases, abandoning a child is due to the refusal of parents that their child has severe intellectual or psychological damage.
Wild children may experience severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are assumed to have been raised by animals, and some supposedly lived alone in the wild.
If fully raised by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within body boundaries) that are almost entirely similar to the behaviors of the animal that raised him, such as fear of humans or indifference to humans.
>>bos_Latn<< While learning on a project should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not an educational method, but rather support for individuals facing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a scaffolding form, as well as an animated staple that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in software and is intended to examine, refer to, and explain procedures that may present the learner with too great a challenge to solve on their own.
Children are placed in the foster care system for various reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, but it does happen.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is obliged to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should meet all the needs that are missing in the home from which they were taken.
>>bos_Latn<< The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" are cited as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"When researching visitor reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" as new motivational aspects."
The use of the video allowed important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to discern whether a particular person is lying by the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, argues that people who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He suggested that even animals such as domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Studies in the twentieth century have shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: veiled and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
>>bos_Latn<< Segregation and recombination in each generation shift variability between the two sources.
In savanna primates with a human-like digestive system, it is difficult to meet the need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In fact, failure has serious consequences: less growth, poor nutrition and eventually death.
The most available plant resources were proteins from leaves and legumes, but primates like us find it difficult to digest uncooked.
Conversely, animal food ( ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also contains large amounts of protein that contain all essential amino acids.
"When all things considered, we should not be surprised that our ancestors ''the question of protein intake'' solved in almost the same way as the chimpanzees on the savanna do today."
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during a normal period of sleep and going back to sleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This is possible by simply using a relatively quiet alarm clock to reach consciousness without fully waking up.
If you realize that you are turning off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include consuming plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which makes you get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is in contrast to the amount of tension of his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the life force present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but is extended by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini yoga stimulates Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Divine yoga is at the center of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and enlightenment awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the end of the war differences in systems, procedures and cultures led to hostilities between the two countries.
Two years before the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be led by really empowered armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans failed almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered Poland and created a Belarusian and Ukrainian front after the invasion of the eastern Polish regions, thus violating the Riga Peace Accords, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Boat transport is certainly the most efficient way in which a large number of people and a large amount of goods can cross the ocean.
>>bos_Latn<< The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods while at the same time disabling the ability of the enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport manpower and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
They were usually kept tame in herds that roamed the hills and other pastures, and were kept by so-called goatherds, usually children or adolescents, which is the name for shepherds who guard the goats.
Horse-drawn carriage tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the first wooden rails for wagons consisted only of parallel stacked planks, they allowed horses pulling wagons with a higher speed of movement and pulling a larger load than would have been possible on the somewhat more rugged roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually seen that the rails could be more efficient with iron at the top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagon.
In the end, the iron wheels replaced the wooden ones. The first fully iron rails were presented in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (the upright man) appeared.
>>bos_Latn<< Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedal gait occurs in Australopithecines about 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even be activists to reduce suffering somewhat in the future.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we are not looking for a solution that is only temporary, we need to find the root of these problems and neutralize them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems are increasing due to the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of people.
After Congress passed a manuscript draft on July 4, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, he was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of the Independence Hall building.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. The specimen arrived in London on August 10.
25 copies of Dunlap that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many bird features resemble those of dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their legs, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the handling of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container with medicines or toxic chemicals for the household.
On the label, look for specific first aid instructions relating to this poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists in the official sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from well-known bedbugs, insects that have adapted very well to parasitizing humans.
Killer bedbugs and common bedbugs depend on their hosts, in whose nests or living quarters they live.
About 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system that is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
The couple may conclude that raising a newborn is not in their best interest or the best interest of their child.
Such couples can give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, biological parents waive their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works with the scientific method. This method is actually a guideline for most scientific research.
In addition to this method, experimentation, or experiments that present tests to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, question asking and observation also direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West broke ties with Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Numerous recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not just a response to external cyclical stimuli, have been detected in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the period of free cycles even if there are no external signs.
>>bos_Latn<< The experiment performed by Hershey and Chase was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in the bacteria.
They performed two experiments that pointed to DNA in a phage with radioactive phosphorus or a phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a multitude of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are of a germinative line.
Only mutations in sex cells can be transmitted to children while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including wildlife.
Examples of activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and travel by car to the workplace while those who have just left the workplace pass by.
In this dynamic transport scenario, everyone is somehow connected to a traffic system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now states that this cumbersome carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, water quality complaints or bridge collapses are rare.
Why are traffic systems the cause of so many complaints; why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is it something much bigger?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave relatively consistently, so traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be presented roughly mathematically.
For a better view of the traffic flow, links between the three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take off. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape the enemy more easily and find food and steam more efficiently.
Most insects have this advantage that they can bend their wings backwards along the body.
This allows them a greater number of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can not bend the wings of dragonflies and waterflowers.
A few thousand years ago Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many were convinced the opposite - that the solar system, including the Sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
20% of the world’s water flowing from rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6387 km (3,980 miles) long. It flows water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids were built until the collapse of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and technical excellence of the pyramids at Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, who were then more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican's population is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and dill since they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything was made up of one or a mixture of more than four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like four aggregate states (in the same order): rigid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, though he also theorized about them changing into new substances to form into what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains a number of elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into a point at the end of this sentence.
The pen thus became a close companion to a large number of people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer ways of writing, the pen has lost its status and is increasingly rarely used.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, so they don't even need a sharpener.
We can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The fission bomb acts on the principle of taking energy to assemble a nucleus with numerous protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy wheelbarrow up a hill, dividing the core frees up some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to decay when pushed slightly or without pushing.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner in the area of the lunar seas, and thicker in the area of the highlands.
On the near side there could be more dark areas because the bark is thinner. The lava has more easily reached the surface.
Content theories focus on figuring out what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with maturation and growing up.
These theories look at what drives some people to want what they want and what causes them to do or not do something in the environment.
>>bos_Latn<< Two popular content theories are Maslow's Needs hierarchy theory and Herzberg's Two Factors theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can come to light in the event that the leaders begin to manage former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum are attempts to remain a ""part of the team""."
This type of leader encounters difficulties in making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary measures, conducting evaluations, assigning competencies and calling people to account.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has done so far and do his own thing.
It is ultimately the team leader who is responsible for its success or failure.
This behavior often leads to a gap between leaders and others.
Virtual teams should adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
>>bos_Latn<< Members of virtual teams often present a touchpoint to the closest physical group.
They are often more autonomous than classical team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which the local administration may not understand.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, 109 p.) is also a unique component of the virtual team. "
"Invisible team" represents a team of leadership that suits each member. Invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through a lengthy process of establishing a learning organization again? Innovation is one of the goals of putting organizational concepts of learning into practice.
After efficient consumption of all available resources in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity come to the fore.
As a result, the process of organization that seeks to overcome the obstacle through cooperation can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer’s needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous approach as a method by which organizations can achieve a higher degree of efficiency.
Neurobiological data present physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. This makes the field of research more narrow and much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior is confirmed by the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science-fiction connotation, it forms a very important branch of information science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of the machine.
Artificial intelligence research involves making machines for the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in economics, medicine, construction and the military because it is embedded in some software applications for home use computers and video games.
Excursions are a significant part of each class. Often the teacher would gladly take her students to places for which traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution for virtual excursions. Students can view exhibits at the museum, visit an aquarium, or admire the beautiful art while sitting in class.
Virtual excursion sharing is also a great way to think about the road and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the site changes, but old versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve a student's writing skills. When they start running a blog, students often make mistakes in grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience corrects this in most cases.
>>bos_Latn<< Since students are the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to tend to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog also “forces students to become more resourceful in the world around them.” The need to stimulate the interest of the audience inspires them to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to transfer learning outside of the traditional school.
"The appropriate use of blogs ""may encourage students to think analytically and critically; by actively responding to materials from the Internet, students can define their point of view in the context of others' writings and present their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming capital and offers a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Somewhat further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to pristine natural beauty in the Muskoka region and beyond.
Because of all these things, the foreigners of Ontario perceive essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost ruled by uninhabited wildlife.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when it comes to plant and animal life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have links with France and are well-known luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, which had put deep roots in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the maritime route from Europe to India.
The area is surrounded by the Sahel to the north, or the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that women on the journey say that they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
>>bos_Latn<< Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something that could be considered harassment and it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Decisively reject men and don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself (that’s not right regardless of cultural differences!).
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and in the time of the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids the city was known as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, to leave it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to him by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of Morocco's most unrivaled shopping spots.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as pecks, pots, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of trinkets, but that is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
>>srp_Latn<< In 2002, Goma was destroyed by a lion from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, and especially the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma need to be investigated to understand the nature of the fighting taking place in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest trekking options with mountain gorillas in Africa.
For a tour of Goma you can use a point-to-point (moto taxi). The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands."
Although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and owns an airport, Timbuktu is now an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of sandstorms.
It was one of the main venues where Henry Louis Gates stopped during the filming of the PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is the opposite of other cities in the country because it has more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies to the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is made up of the Crocodile River.
The area of the park of 19,500 km2 is divided into 14 different ecozones, and in each of them there is a different type of wildlife.
>>srp_Latn<< It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered South Africa's leading national park (SANParks).
As in other South African national parks, daily nature conservation fees and tickets are required.
>>srp_Latn<< It might also benefit someone to buy a wild card that allows entry to certain parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which is the main centre for many tourists.
The exhibition of buildings that make up Hong Kong's panorama is comparable to the shimmering column chart, which is even more noticeable thanks to the sea in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely compacted on the derelict land along the north coast.
This place was claimed by British colonizers so if you're looking for evidence of colonial past territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast all the way to Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not just mangrove swamps, they include some of the last places of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Valley.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which approximately one-third is covered by water-wet areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is now estimated to be home to 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart all day from the intercity bus station (via the river), but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a couple of days in advance.
>>srp_Latn<< In most counties, small Japanese Toyota Coaster brand buses run that are comfortable and sturdy.
Taxi sharing is a fast and enjoyable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu.) and Punakh (200 Nu.).
The bridge over the Oyapock River connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters. It is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The height of the free passage under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be put into operation in September 2017 when it is expected to be completed by the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous community inhabited in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who practiced self-supply agriculture as well.
The Chaco province was home to other native tribes, such as Guaycurá and Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
After the encounter of Spanish invaders with the indigenous population in the 16th century, Paraguay was created, previously known as the "Great Province of India".
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Paraguay has largely retained its indigenous character and identity since the founding of Asuncion in 1537.
Argentina's national team and half-players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo courts in Las Ca'itas
Minor tournaments and games are also held in other parts of the year.
For tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for half matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo alliance page.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal to the British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
In remote islands, they probably do not accept credit cards, but they may accept British and American currency; ask the owner in advance to find out about an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to replace the Falklandian currency outside the islands, so replace the money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical belt; temperatures of +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the combination of wind and moisture makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
"There are no special ""rain"" or ""dry"" seasons: the amount of rain is mostly the same throughout the year."
Although many animals in the park are used to visiting people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park management, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters to bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters to other wildlife!
No matter how obedient they may look, buffalo, deer, reindeer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they haven't kept a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them room.
In addition, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with a strong smell, and keep the camping site clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
>>bos_Latn<< Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The naval battle took place in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank except one British cruiser. Nearly 200 German and American nationals lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, during a peaceful gathering in the city, the murder of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III took place.
As there are two ports in Auckland, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches on the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific coast and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All the beaches are sandy, it is safe to swim on them, and the shade is provided by the trees of Pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the port of Waitemata, in the wealthy districts of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
These are family beaches where there is sometimes a crowd with a large number of shops that stretch the coast. Swimming is safe.
"The main one is the local beer "Number One". The beer is not complex, but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called ""Manta""."
There are plenty of French wines to try, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might be better for you.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are fearful, you can easily find bottled water.
"The term ""flat white"" coffee is foreign to Australians. Short black coffee is ""espresso"", cappuccino has a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk. "
Hot chocolate is at the level of Belgian. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries due to some of the above causes are rare.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and stick to safety warnings.
Sea wasps appear near the beaches and river mouths north of the city 1770 from October to April. Sometimes they also appear in other months.
Sharks do exist, but they often attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is in the mouths of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance takes the burden off the passenger’s back because he knows that he will have somewhere to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, organized airport shuttle, or even combination flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents needed to arrive at your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be addressed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of participants camp at the venue of the festival and most consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the stage as possible, you will have to come early to take your place.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stages ends, some parts of the festival will continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas designed for families with small children.
If you are traveling in the northern Baltic in winter, be careful when choosing a cabin, because passing through the ice creates a terrible noise that is heard more in certain cabins.
St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Passengers on the cruise do not need to have a visa (check the conditions).
Casinos tend to maximize the amount of time and money guests spend. Usually there are no windows or watches, and exits are hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to maintain the good mood of guests and keep them in the facility.
Some facilities offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness reduces the ability to judge and all good gamblers are aware of how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below zero.
On icy roads and snow-covered roads, there’s a bit of friction and you can’t drive like you’re on clear asphalt.
During a blizzard in the short term, enough snow can fall to get you stuck in it.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or carried by wind, condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, but traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest lure for tourists in Africa and the best experience for many visitors.
The term safari in everyday use refers to a trip by land with the purpose of touring amazing African wildlife, especially in savannas.
>>bos_Latn<< Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to the car and a good view is possible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
"A hiking safari (also referred to as a ""walk bushem"", ""mountain safari"" or ""safari on foot") consists of walking that lasts from a few hours to a few days."
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, host of the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you have booked a flight and accommodation for the 2020 Games before they are postponed, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but as of late March, most of the cancellation rules due to the coronavirus were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most of the events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 euros, and ordinary tickets will cost about 7,000 euros.
You can dry wet clothes with ironing. Many hotels will rent you an iron and an ironing board even if they are not in the room.
If you don’t have an iron, or if you don’t like wearing ironed socks, you can also use a hair dryer if you have it handy.
Make sure that the fabric does not overheat (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for one minute, and in others it takes several minutes.
Filters differ in efficiency, and if you have doubts, buy water in closed bottles from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not used to in their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, transmit poison or infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by using force are usually not classified as plagues.
Purchasing in duty-free shops is an opportunity to purchase tax-exempt and excise-free products at certain locations.
Travellers traveling for high-tax countries can save a significant amount of money, especially when buying alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most demanding driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburg Highway, often passing through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared for anything: steep inclines, narrow passages and sharp bends prevail.
The prescribed speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections, usually 35-40 mi/h (56-64 km/h) and strict adherence to the limit is more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, mobile service here is better than on many other sections of the road, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery products are quite good and diverse in Bavaria, as with the southern neighbors of Austrians.
Pastry pastries with fruit are common, for example apples added to sweets all year round and cherries and plums used in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. With popular cakes, a cup of strong coffee often goes well.
If you want small but generous snacks, try what they call Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
"Depending on the amount of fluid, the curry can be ""dry"" or ""wet""."
Yogurt is a common ingredient of curry in the interior of northern India and Pakistan; in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is the umbrella term for a multitude of regional cuisines around the country.
But, if used without further additions, the term denotes food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago, and consists of a number of simply spicy dishes in which the inhabitants of Java are dominated by the favorite flavors of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javan coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Strenuous are the supports for the legs of the rider who hangs on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but also include certain safety risks as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse but his leg is stuck in the stirrup, the horse could pull him if he escapes. To reduce the risk, certain safety measures should be taken.
First, most drivers wear boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Ctoms, some saddles, and especially English saddles, contain safety bars that allow the stirrup strap to be unhooked from the saddle if the rider in the fall pulls it backwards.
>>srp_Latn<< The Cochamá Valley is a major climbing destination in Chile, also known as the South American Yosemite thanks to the diversity of large granite cliffs and cliffs.
From the tops, breathtaking views are provided. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among the endless possibilities it offers.
Snow sports with a descent down the slope, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending down the snow slope using a ski or snowboard attached to the legs.
>>srp_Latn<< "Skiing is an important travel activity, and many people known as ""ski enthusiasts"" plan their vacations around skiing in a particular location."
The idea of skiing is very old - paintings in caves depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
>>bos_Latn<< Downhill as a sport goes back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational skiing club.
Travel with backpack on back and on skis: also referred to as backcountry skiing, ski tour or ski hiking.
It is associated with alpine skiing or hiking although it usually does not include them. Hiking usually takes place on steep terrain and requires tighter skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel a slightly larger distance than walking, but you will very rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on the arranged paths.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it consists of a number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean applying for a visa multiple times and passing passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a single country in this respect.
As long as you are in that zone, you can generally cross the border without passing passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen member state individually, which saves time, money and reduces the amount of paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antiques. Some tax administrations define antiques as goods older than 100 years.
There are geographical differences in definition, so the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products can be called antiques although they were created later than similar mass-produced goods.
The management of reindeer is an important source of income among the Sami people, and the culture associated with trading is also important for many people of other professions.
However, traditionally, not all members of the Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer farming but lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, and reindeer were mainly used for towing them.
Today, many Sámi are engaged in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in the area of Sami, Sápmi.
"Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romanian peoples, it is often considered offensive because of its connection to negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions about Roma."
If the country you are travelling to is on the list of countries for which an alert has been issued, this may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You can consult with governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often short, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
A storm is a generic term for any phenomenon of dangerous weather with the possibility of causing harm, serious social disorder, or loss of human lives.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world in a variety of forms, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of dangerous weather conditions, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, showers and cyclones.
>>bos_Latn<< Regional and seasonal adverse weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to be aware of the possible risk of bad weather occurring in their area as this may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo vocational training.
"If you do an intretic search with the keywords ""course for hostile areas"", you will find the address of the local company."
The course generally covers in more detail all the issues discussed here, usually with practical experience.
>>bos_Latn<< The course usually takes 2 to 5 days and includes a role-playing game, many first aid-related lessons and sometimes weapons handling training.
Many books and magazines deal with wilderness survival, but editions that deal with war zones are rare.
Passengers planning a sex change operation abroad must bring valid return documents with them.
>>srp_Latn<< The willingness to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or documents updated to fit the desired name and gender varies from government to government.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect such documents also varies from government to government.
Search at checkpoints also became more drastic in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery are unlikely to go through the scanner without violating privacy and dignity.
A return sea current is a return surge of waves that smash against the shore, often against a reef or the like.
Due to underground topology, the return flow is concentrated on a couple of deeper parts and it is possible to create a fast current towards higher depths.
Death usually occurs when a person gets tired of trying to swim against the current, which is often impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to swim so that you don’t get caught up in electricity again or, depending on your skills and whether someone has spotted you, you can wait for help.
The shock of returning to your culture occurs before the culture shock. The pleasure phase is shorter, the shock lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their native one again.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits that belong to your culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers in a new country needed time to adjust.
People may not expect that when returning to their homes, patience and understanding are necessary.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.
Usually the sounds of tourists and merchants are heard. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is in the role of a background and storyteller of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, lays the rights of several nations and has the most bases - sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, where Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded crater of the still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The Ellsworth Land region is south of the island, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge into the plateau here, and then rise again and form a 360-mile-long chain of Ellsworth Mountains intersected by the Minnesota glacier.
At the northern part of the Sentinel range are the highest Antarctic mountains, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Vinson at 4892 m.
>>bos_Latn<< In remote places where there is no signal coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you have to phone outdoors and the satellite has to be in sight to make a call.
The service is often used in freight forwarding, on recreational vessels, but also on expeditions that need remote data and voice transmission.
A telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who plan to take a year off is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with those who leave school because it allows them to take a year off before college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during your free year can actually improve your chances of transitioning to higher education in your country.
>>srp_Latn<< There is usually a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
"Finland is a great destination for boating." "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos."
For archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough to sail yachts, riding on smaller boats or kayaks offers a completely different experience.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, which has one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this number is one in forty).
>>bos_Latn<< Most famous Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days, and at night return and sleep on the boat.
If you are travelling to the mainland as part of boat excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
The brochures of some cruises include Berlin in Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrible experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
This is not to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fears and dislikes that many people feel for other things.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome fear based on unknowns or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for the prompt delivery of shipments. Often time is of the utmost importance when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but the problem has arisen with other routes and smaller companies.
If cargo were to be sent by air, unloading and customs procedures on some routes would take days.
The only way to get through this faster is to send things as checked luggage. According to the rules of the airline, luggage can not travel without passengers, and that is where you come in.
It is understood that you will be able to fly first or business class if you allocate a large bundle of banknotes for this privilege (or, better yet, let your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: generally speaking, expect it to cost you up to four times the usual cost of economy class seats, that is, eleven times the first class!
Generally speaking, it makes no sense to ask for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that a certain group of passengers is willing to pay a large sum of money for the privilege of a fast and comfortable trip, so they determine the prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the population is Romanian but Russian is in wide use.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has faced ethnic conflicts.
>>bos_Latn<< In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox religion is the majority religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. It is the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna (Izmir) is today a modern, developed and bustling commercial center surrounded by mountains lying around a vast bay.
Wide boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping malls are interspersed with classic red tile roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere resembles more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
You can see the nearby island of Eysturoy from the village of Haldarsvák, and there is also an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over individual tombs.
It is worth a half-hour walk to an intriguing village.
To the north lies the easily accessible romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after a brilliant display of its beauty by Lord Byron.
Bus Scotturb 403 regularly runs for Sintra, and stops in Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Oltar), a place of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Note that you are visiting the location of a mass grave that has an almost undetectable meaning for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still a large number of men and women who have survived this, as well as those whose relatives were killed or worked there to the death, whether Jews or not.
Treat this place with the dignity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not scold the site with painted or carved graffiti in existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the characters are only in Catalan because the same is established by law as the first official language.
Yes, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other infrastructure.
Regular announcements on the metro are in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced through the automatic system in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
>>bos_Latn<< Parisians are reputed to be rude and arrogant egocentric.
"Although this is often an incorrect stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is to behave nicely, that is, to behave like someone who is ""bien élevé"" (well-bred). This will significantly facilitate your stay."
The harsh exterior of Parisians will suddenly disappear if you show some basics of kindness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, and the most common are beech, spruce and fir trees. The park is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The park inhabits a particularly wide range of plant communities thanks to different microclimates, soil types, and variations in altitude within the park.
There are a wide variety of animals and birds in the area.
Here you can find rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and grouse deaf, along with many other more common species
When visiting the monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees as well as clothing that covers their shoulders.
Most monasteries have covers for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own covers, especially in bright colors, a monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
You can borrow them at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each visitor so you may not be comfortable wearing it. The sizes are universal!
Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar zones of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil in everything.
Well amb Oli is a favorite simple dish that is especially eaten in the summer: it is bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any supplement that is on hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns, but also the pronoun ""Sie"" meaning ""You"", always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
>>srp_Latn<< This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
No doubt it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out if a verb or adjective is used in a named form.
The pronunciation of Italian is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters that need particular attention are c and g because their pronunciation varies depending on the next vowel.
Also make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, and carro means caro.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively simple and mostly regular.
This grammar beginner will help you learn a lot about the grammar of the Persian language and better understand the phrases.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know something Spanish can easily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be taught separately.
Today, pre-modern observatories are most often obsolete and are used as museums or educational places.
Mild pollution in their best days was not the problem it is today. They are usually found in cities or campuses and are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
The most modern research telescopes are huge objects in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
The cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China where the favorite flower was the plum flower.
In Japan, the first parties of the cherry blossom were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility around the imperial palace.
"Plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove the ""only one"" specimen."
"If you visit a formally landscaped garden, for the sake of collecting ""examples"" you will be expelled without further discussion."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place and it is very easy to navigate it and once you arrive you can buy almost anything.
Located in the middle of the tropics just a few degrees north of the equator you will need to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
Several buses drive north to Hebron, a cemetery where biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried according to tradition.
Make sure you take the bus you want to travel all the way to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday topic.
For example, a visit to castles in the valley of the Loire River or the Rhine, a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also establish routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions characteristic of this holiday have been adopted by both non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
As usual, the Easter night wakes up in an open place to see the sunrise.
For this tradition, of course, there are Christian theological explanations, but perhaps it is a pre-Christian fertility rite in honor of the arrival of spring.
In more traditional churches, the Easter Vigil is often held on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and communities begin celebrating Christ’s resurrection at the stroke of midnight.
Most of the animals originally came to the islands by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, mammals could not reach the island, so the giant turtle became the main ruminant in the Galapagos.
Since man came to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience a polar night, which means that the sun does not appear above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to see the polar light because the sky will more or less constantly be dark.
Since areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese culture of work is considerably more hierarchically focused and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
At the workplace, suits are worn, and coworkers are named after each other by last names or position at work.
The harmony in the workplace is crucial - the emphasis is on joint effort, not on glorifying the achievements of individuals.
Workers must often seek the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without any question.
