“We were all in shock,” his mother said.
When asked what her father had said, she replied, "He couldn't say a word - he just stood there and blinked."
“It will behave like water. It is transparent, just like water...”
>>srp_Cyrl<< So if you were standing on the shore, you could see every pebble or sludge that was on the very bottom.
“To our knowledge, there is only one planetary body that shows greater dynamics than Titan, and that is Earth,” he added.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The problem began on January 1 when dozens of local residents began complaining to the postal service in Obanazawa, as they did not receive their traditional and regular New Year's greeting cards.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The post office apologized to citizens and in the media yesterday after discovering that the boy had hidden over 600 postal documents, including 429 New Year's greeting cards, which were not delivered to intended recipients.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Moon's unmanned orbiter Chandrayan-1 ejected its Moon Impact Probe (MIS) which was speeding on the surface of the Moon at a speed of 1.5 kilometers per second (3,000 miles per hour), and successfully crashed near the Moon's south pole.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Apart from three important scientific instruments, the lunar probe also carried an image of the national flag of India, painted on all sides.
“Thanks to those who supported convicts like me the quote is Siripornova, uttered at the press conference.
“There may be people who disagree, but I don’t care.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'm happy that there are people who are willing to support me.
Since Pakistan's independence from British rule in 1947, the Pakistani president has appointed "political agents" to manage the FATA area, and they have almost complete self-control over the areas.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These agents are responsible for providing services to the government and judiciary under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The hostel collapsed in Mecca, a holy Islamic city, at approximately 10am this morning local time.

>>srp_Cyrl<< The death toll is at least 15, and is expected to rise further.
Leonov, also known as "Cosmonaut No. 11", was part of the original Soviet team of cosmonauts.
On 18 March 1965, he performed his first manned outing (EVA), or "walking in space", and was left alone outside the spacecraft for just over twelve minutes.
For his work, he received the Hero of the Soviet Union medal, the highest decoration of the Soviet Union.
>>srp_Cyrl<< 10 years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission which symbolically marked the end of the space race.
She said: “There is no information to suggest that an attack is imminent.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, reducing the level of danger to serious does not mean that the general danger has disappeared."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although the authorities did not confirm the authenticity of the threat, the Maryland Transportation Authority made the decision to close in consultation with the FBI.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The kippers were used to block the entrance to the tunnel, and help from 80 police officers was provided to direct drivers to the bypass roads.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No major traffic slowdowns were reported on the Circular Road, an alternative city road.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Nigeria has previously announced that it plans to join the African CFTA in the week leading up to the summit.
>>srp_Cyrl<< AU Commissioner for Trade and Industry, Albert Muchanga, announced that Benin would join.
The commissioner said: “We have not yet agreed on the rules of origin and customs relief, but the framework we have is enough to start trading on July 1, 2020.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The station did not change its behavior until the end of the spacewalking mission, despite the loss of a gyroscope in the previous space mission.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Chiao and Sharipov reported being at a safe distance from the thrusters to adjust movement.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Russian flight control activated jet engines and the normal station position was re-established.

>>srp_Cyrl<< This is the first time the ruling was passed using a law that went into effect in 2003, which curbs the loading of email mailboxes, known as spam, by undesirable distributors.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Twenty-one-year-old Jesus joined Manchester City in January of last, 2017 from Brazilian club Palmeiras for an alleged sum of 27 million pounds.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since then, the Brazilian for the club has featured in 53 matches in all competitions and scored 24 goals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dr Lee also expressed concern about reports of children in Turkey who are now infected with the bird flu virus A(H5N1) and are not sick at the same time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He stated that some research indicates that the disease would have to become less deadly before it could cause a global epidemic.
There is concern that patients could infect more people when performing their daily routines, if flu symptoms remain mild.
Leslie Aoun, a spokesman for the Komen Foundation, said the organization has adopted a new rule that does not allow the allocation of funds or funding to organizations that are under legal investigation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Comena's policy disqualified Planned Parenthood for pending an investigation, as to how Planned Parenthood spends and reports its money, conducted by Representative Cliff Sterns.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sterns in his role as Chair in the Subcommittee on Oversight and Research and which is under the Energy and Commerce Committee, investigates whether the tax is used to fund abortion through Planned Parenthood.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney won the Republican Party's first presidential election in Florida, Tuesday, with over 46 percent of the vote.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich finished in second place with 32 percent.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As the state in which the winner takes everything, Florida awarded Romney all fifty delegates, pushing him forward as the first nominee in the Republican Party.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Protest organisers said about 100,000 people gathered in German cities like Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police estimated that there were 6500 protesters in Berlin.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Protests also took place in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valletta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia, and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In London, about 200 people protested in front of the offices of major copyright owners.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Last month, there were major protests in Poland when that country signed the ACTA agreement, which led to the Polish government deciding for the time being not to ratify the agreement.
Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the process of joining ACTA.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are again calling for the mandatory installation of CCTV cameras for video surveillance in all Australian slaughterhouses.
>>srp_Cyrl<< David Oshenesi, chief inspector of the RSPCA (Royal Association for the Prevention of Violence against Animals) of New South Wales told ABC that monitoring and inspection of slaughterhouses should be common in Australia.
“CCTV would certainly send a strong signal to those working with animals that their welfare is their highest priority.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< On the international earthquake map of the United States Geological Topographic Institute there was no earthquake in Iceland in the previous week.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Icelandic Meteorological Institute has not reported any seismological activity in the Hekla area in the past 48 hours.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A significant earthquake activity due to the phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeastern part of the caldera at the top of the volcano.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The existence of dark clouds at the foot of the mountain has been reported to have nothing to do with any volcanic activity.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Clouds created the possibility for confusion as to whether there had actually been an eruption.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The luno contained 120-160 cubic meters of fuel when it broke down, and strong winds and waves pushed it onto the breakwater.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The helicopters rescued those twelve crew members and the only injury was a broken nose.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The 100-foot ship was on its way to pick up its usual cargo of fertilizer, and originally officials feared the vessel might spill the cargo.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Both houses had already approved the proposed amendment in 2011.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The change came at this legislative session, when the House of Representatives first deleted the second sentence, to be passed by the Senate in a similar form on Monday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A random exception to the second sentence, which proposes a ban on same-sex civil unions, could open up the possibility of bringing civil unions together in the future.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Following the process, HJR-3 will consider the next elected legislative power in 2015 or 2016 to remain in force.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Among Wattier's achievements outside the realm of directing is the 1973 hunger strike, which was directed against political censorship.
French law was changed. His activism began when he was 15 years old, when he joined the French resistance movement during World War II.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He wrote about himself in a 1998 book.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the 1960s, he returned to teach film directing in Algeria, which had just achieved independence.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Japanese judist Hitoshi Saito, winner of two Olympic medals, has died at the age of 54.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As a cause of death, he was listed with intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He died on Tuesday in Osaka.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In addition to being a former Olympic and World Champion, Saito was also chairman of the All-Japanese Judo Federation Training Committee at the time of his death.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At least a hundred people were at the party to celebrate the first anniversary of the couple who got married last year.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The celebration anniversary is scheduled for a later date, officials said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The couple married in Texas a year ago and they came to Buffalo to celebrate the wedding with friends and relatives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The 30-year-old husband, who was born in Buffalo, was one of four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Carno is a well-known but controversial professor of English who has taught at the education centers Modern Education and King's Glory and who has claimed that the number of his students has reached 9,000 in the most successful period of his career.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In his notes, he used words that some parents considered rude, and they also say he used ugly words in class.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Modern education accused him of printing large advertising ads on buses without approval and of lying, saying he was the chief teacher of English.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He had also previously been charged with copyright infringement, but no lawsuit was filed against him.
A former student said he “used slang in class, taught entertaining skills in notes, and was like a student’s friend.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Over the last three decades, despite officially remaining a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since then, China's economic size has grown by 90 times.
For the first time last year, China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the industry’s largest market.
China’s GDP could be higher than the U.S. in two decades.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tropical Storm Daniel, the fourth named storm in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, originated in the eastern part of the Atlantic.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, maintains maximum wind speeds of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scientists from the National Hurricane Center predict that Daniel will grow into a hurricane by Wednesday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Born in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, Bobek gained fame playing for Partizan from Belgrade.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He joined them in 1945 and remained until 1958.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During his engagement on the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 matches.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No one has ever made more appearances and made more goals for the club than Bobek.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was named the best player in Partizan history in 1995.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The celebrations began with a special point of the world-famous Cirque du Soleil group.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, the Janissary Military Band and singers Fatih Erkoch and Muslum Gurses.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Then Mevlevi (spinning dervishes) came out on the scene.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Turkish diva Sezen Axu had a performance with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Harris Alexiuouum.
Finally, the Turkish dance group Fire of Anatolia performed the dance act "Troy".
>>srp_Cyrl<< Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle driver, died after being involved in a crash at a motor racing track in Indianapolis.
>>srp_Cyrl<< While driving the warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his engine, and was then hit by fellow racer Xavier Zayat.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Immediately, the medical staff on the track provided him with assistance, and he was transported to a local hospital where he later died.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Zayat was unharmed in the accident.
As for the global financial situation, Zapatero continued by declaring that “the financial system is part of the economy, its key part.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We have a one-year financial crisis, which has had its peak in the past two months, and I think now financial markets are starting to recover."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Last week, the website Naked News announced that it would dramatically increase the range of news broadcasts in foreign languages, with three new broadcasts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A global organization that already reports in English and Japanese, launches programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, Internet and mobile devices.
“Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a morbid scene of people trying to break windows to get out.
>>srp_Cyrl<< People were hitting the window panes with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
“One glass finally broke and people started coming out of the window,” survivor Franciszek Kowal said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stars emit light and heat due to the energy that is created when hydrogen atoms fuse (fusion) and form heavier elements.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scientists are working to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years until we see the construction of useful fusion reactors.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A steel needle floats on the water due to surface voltage.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The surface voltage occurs because the water molecules on the water surface are strongly attracted to each other, more than is the case with the air molecules above them.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Water molecules make an invisible cuticle on the surface, which allows things like a needle to float on the water.
The slider of a modern skate has a double edge with a recessed cavity between them. The two edges allow for a better grip on the ice, even when tilted.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since the lower part of the blade is slightly curved, while the blade tilts to one side or the other, the edge that is in contact with the ice also curves.
This allows the sliders to turn. If the slider tilts to the right, the slider turns to the right, if the slider tilts to the left, the slider turns to the left.
>>srp_Cyrl<< To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the excess energy they received from light.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a “photon.”
Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because atoms are stimulated by bright light, which causes photons to emit light, and light is a type of radiation.
The following picture shows atoms emitting photons. Of course, in reality, photons are much smaller than those in the picture.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Photons are smaller even than the things that make up atoms!
>>srp_Cyrl<< After hundreds of hours of operation the fiber bulb eventually burns out and the bulb no longer works.
The bulb should then be replaced. It is necessary to be careful when replacing the bulb.
>>srp_Cyrl<< First, the light switch should be turned off or the cable pulled out.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is because the current flowing into the bulb's throat, where its metal part is located, can give you a strong electric shock if you touch the inside of the throat or the lamp's metal base while it is still partially in the throat.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps blood.
Blood moves from the heart further in tubes called arteries, and returns to the heart with tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Triceratops teeth could crush not only leaves, but even very tough branches and roots.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some scientists think that triceratops ate cicadas, which are a type of plant that was widespread in the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, pointed leaves.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Triceratops may have used its powerful beak to remove the leaves before it would eat the tree.
Other scientists claim that these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely that they were eaten by any dinosaur, although today sloths and other animals like parrots (a descendant of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you stood on the surface of the Io, you'd have less weight than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth on Iya would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg). So gravity, of course, pulls you weaker.
The sun doesn't have a crust like Earth's, on which you can stand. The whole sun is composed of gases, fire and plasma.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Gas becomes rarer the more you move away from the center of the Sun.
The outer part that we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means “ball of light”.
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to perceive that Venus had me, just like the Moon.
They happen to me because only that side of Venus (or the Moon) that is facing the Sun is illuminated. Venus's me supported Copernicus' theory that planets move around the Sun.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks noticed the transit of Venus.
>>srp_Cyrl<< England experienced a long period of peace after the recapture of Dannelag.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, in 991 Ethelred was faced with a Viking fleet larger than any since the time of Guthrum a century before that.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This fleet was led by Olaf Triggason, a Norwegian with ambitions to liberate his country from Danish domination.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After initial military setbacks Ethelred was able to make a deal with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to regain his kingdom with variable success.
Hangul is the only purpose-designed alphabet used in popular usage. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
>>srp_Cyrl<< King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joson dynasty and is one of the most respected.
He originally referred to the Hangul alphabet as Hunminjeongeum, which translates to "exact voices for teaching people".
There are many theories about how Sanskrit originated. One of them is about the migration of Aryans from the west to India, who then brought their own language with them.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sanskrit is an ancient language and can be compared to Latin, which was used in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit only faded because of the hierarchy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, from which many modern Indian languages developed, just as Latin was the basis for European languages such as French and Spanish.
At the end of the Battle of France, Germany began to prepare for an invasion of the island of Britain.
Germany gave the attack the code name "Operation Sea Lion". Most of the British army's heavy weapons and supplies were lost when it evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Krigsmarine") and could destroy any attack fleet that would be sent across the English Channel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, very few ships of the Royal Navy were near likely conquering routes, as the admirals feared they would be sunk by a German attack from the air.
Let’s start with an explanation of Italy’s plans. Italy was mostly the “younger brother” of Germany and Japan.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Their army and navy were weaker, although they had just built four (4) new ships just before the war began.
The main objectives of Italy were African countries. To conquer these countries, they would have to have a base to launch troops, so that troops could sail the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
As a result, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, Italian battleships were not allowed to do anything else.
Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Submarines are vessels designed to travel underwater and stay there for an extended period of time.
The submarines were used in World War I and World War II. They were extremely slow at the time and had a fairly limited firing range.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At the beginning of the war, they mostly traveled on the surface of the sea, but as the radar began to develop and become more accurate, submarines were forced to go under water so as not to be spotted.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans were very good at navigating and operating their submarines.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Due to their success with submarines, after the war the Germans were not given much of the same in possession.
King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "Boy King", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings of modern times.
Interestingly, it was not considered particularly important in ancient times and is not recorded on most ancient royal lists.
However, the discovery of his grave in 1922 turned him into a star. While many of the tombs of the past were looted, this grave remained virtually intact.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most of the items buried alongside Tutankhamun are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The invention of the gear wheel allowed Assyrian chariots to become lighter, faster and more ready to overtake soldiers and other chariots.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Arrows from their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers. around 1000 BC the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry is an army that fights on horses. The saddle was not yet invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of horses.
We know of many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Probably the most famous person from this culture is Homer, a legendary blind poet, who compiled two masterpieces of Greek literature: poems to the Iliad and the Odyssey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The popularity of the playwrights Sophocles and Aristophanes is still ongoing, and their plays are classified as the most important works of world literature.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, mostly known for his famous theorem on the relations of the sides of right triangles.
There are different estimates around how many people speak the Hindu language. It is estimated that the number of speakers in the world is somewhere between the second and fourth place.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The number of native speakers varies depending on whether very closely related dialects are counted.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million people who speak, and as many as 800 million people who can understand this language.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hindi and Urdu are similar by vocabulary, but differ by letter; in everyday conversations, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was heavily influenced by Germany.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the domestic population, so they invented the Estonian literary language.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was based on the German alphabet and a single sign was added to it of the "S/s".
>>srp_Cyrl<< As time passed, many words borrowed from German merged. This was the beginning of enlightenment.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Traditionally, the heir to the throne went directly to the army after finishing school.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Charles went to Trinity University at Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, and thus earned a 2:2 (second-class lower degree).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a diploma.
European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) accounts for 3% of the country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The territory of Turkey is more than 1600 kilometres (1000 miles) long and wider than 800 km (500 mi), and is roughly rectangular in shape.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The area of Turkey, including lakes, occupies an area of 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) are located in Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9174 square miles) in Europe.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The surface of Turkey makes it the 37th largest country in the world and is roughly the size of metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by a sea on three sides: the Aegean Sea in the west, the Black Sea in the north, and the Mediterranean Sea in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back to 1839.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Today's parts of Belgium were part of Luxembourg in the past, but after the Belgian Revolution of 1830 they became Belgian.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Luxembourg always tried to remain a neutral state, but during the First and during the Second World War it was occupied by Germany.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the founders of the organization which is now known as the European Union.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Drukjal Jong is a ruin of a fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of Paro County (in the village of Fondi).
>>srp_Cyrl<< They say that in 1649 Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal made a fortress in memory of his victory against the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Due to the 1951 fire, only some of Drukgial Jong's relics have been preserved, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgial.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, and remains one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the 18th century, Cambodia found itself narrowly between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century, and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also attacked Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and the majority of those employed work in the gray economy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Of the Venezuelans working, two-thirds work in the service sector, nearly a quarter work in industry, and a fifth in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, whose country is a net exporter, although only one percent of people work in the oil industry.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the early years of the nation's independence, the expertise of the Botanical Garden of Singapore helped transform this island into a tropical Garden City.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Wanda Miss Joachim, an orchid hybrid, was selected as a national flower in 1981.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Each year in October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores travel to the southern lowlands, crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills due to rain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< And then back north across the west, again crossing the Mara River, after rains roughly in April.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Serengeti Region consists of Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Reserve and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive classes ("storyboarding", audio and video editing, story telling, etc.)
>>srp_Cyrl<< Interactive design requires you to rethink your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
Interactive design requires that parts of the project be connected to each other, but also make sense as separate entities.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and the number of lens elements needed to achieve the range of focal distances are much higher than that of ordinary lenses.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This becomes an increasingly minor problem as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in their production.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This allowed zoom lenses to create images that can be compared in quality to those achieved with a lens with a fixed focal distance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually smaller.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Because of this, cheap zoom lenses are difficult to use without flash in conditions when the light is weak.
Overscan is one of the most common problems that occurs when you want to convert a movie into a DVD format.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most televisions are made in a way that will please a wide audience.
For this reason, everything you see on TV has cut edges on the top, bottom and sides.
This is done to show the image across the entire screen. This is called “screen edge correction”.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its edges will probably also be cut, and if the video has subtitles that are too close to the lower part of the edge, it will not be seen completely.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The traditional medieval castle has long awakened the imagination, conjuring images of knightly struggles, feasts, and Arthurian chivalry.
Even standing in the middle of a thousand-year-old ruin, it is easy to remember the sounds and smells of battles fought a long time ago, almost to hear the rattling of the hoof in the cobble and to smell the fear as it rises from the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built at all? How were they designed and built?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Typical of this period, Kirby Maxlow Castle is more of a fortified house than a real castle.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not be able to resist a determined attack for long.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When Lord Hastings began its construction in the 1480s, the land was relatively peaceful and the defense was only needed from small gangs of wandering robbers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The balance of power was the system by which European nations attempted to maintain the sovereignty of all European states.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The concept was such that all European nations had to try to prevent one nation from becoming powerful, and therefore national governments often changed their allies to maintain a balance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The war for Spanish heritage was the first war where the main problem was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, given that the European powers no longer had an excuse for these being religious wars. Therefore, the Thirty Years’ War was the last war to be designated as a religious war.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Artemis' temple in Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 BC in a fire set by Herostratus.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to tradition, he was motivated by fame at all costs. The bitter Ephesians ordered that Herostratus' name should never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later recorded that name, and that is why we know it today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, in his capacity as king, offered to finance the restoration of the temple, but his proposal was not respected. After Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Relax your hand as much as possible, trying to still correctly guess all the notes - also, try to minimize unnecessary finger movements.
This way you will tire as little as possible. Remember that there is no need to press the keys with great strength to get additional volume, such as on the piano.
>>srp_Cyrl<< To get the extra volume on the harmonica, use bellows with more pressure or speed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mysticism is the search for an intimate connection, identity with, or awareness of a finite reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The believer seeks direct experience, intuition or insight into divine reality/divineness or divinity.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Followers follow a certain way of living or customs that aim to nurture those experiences.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship, in that it focuses on the direct personal experience of a single state of consciousness, especially in those of a calm, insightful, blissful or even tucked-in character.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century due to sectarian division within the Hindu tradition.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Sikhs consider their faith to be a separate religion from Hinduism, although they acknowledge that it has Hindu roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means “the way of the guru”. Guru is the basic aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has a significance that represents the core of Sikh beliefs.
The religion was founded by Guru Nanak (1469-1539) in the 15th century. He was succeeded by nine subsequent gurus.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, in June 1956, Kruschev's promises were tested, when unrest in Poland, whose workers went on demonstrations dissatisfied with food shortages and declining incomes, grew into mass anti-communist protests.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although eventually Khrushchev sent tanks to establish order, he relented in the face of some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Vladislav Gomulka as the new Prime Minister.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent that covers most of present-day Pakistan and some regions of northwestern India and northeast Afghanistan.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Civilization flourished in the Indus River basins, after which it was named.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although some scientists speculate that since civilization also existed in the basins of the now-drained Saraswati River, it should be properly called the Indus and Saraswati civilization, while some call it the Harapa civilization, according to Harappi, the first of the sites to be excavated in the 1920s.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The militant nature of the Roman Empire was helpful in developing medical progress.
Emperor Augustus began with the involvement of doctors, who even established the first Roman medical corps for treatment after the fighting.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Surgeons had knowledge of various sedatives, such as morphine obtained from poppy seeds and scopolamine from pumpkin seeds.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They became proficient in amputation to save patients from gangrene, as well as in using clamps and arterial pliers to stop the bloodstream.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has made great advances in the field of medicine, which has contributed greatly to the knowledge we possess today.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Purland origami is an origami where there is a restriction that only one fold can be performed at a time, more complex bends such as reverse bends are not allowed, and all bends have predetermined locations.
It was designed by John Smith in the 1970s to facilitate the process for inexperienced “swingers” or people with reduced motor skills.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Children develop awareness of race and racial stereotypes fairly early on and these racial stereotypes influence behavior.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For example, children who identify with a racial minority for whom the stereotype applies that they do not fare well in school, often do not fare well in school after hearing about this stereotype that exists for their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles on it.
These sites have received a lot of attention, especially in an educational context.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are also positive aspects of these websites, which include the ability to easily place a class page on which blogs, videos, images and other plugins can be found.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This page can be easily accessed by giving only one web address, which makes it easy to remember and easy to type to students who may have trouble using the keyboard or with spelling.
It can be adjusted to make reading easier and also with as little or as much color as you want.
Attention deficit disorder is “a neurological syndrome that generally defines three symptoms, including impulsiveness, scattering, and hyperactivity or excess energy.”
It is not a learning disability, it is a learning disorder; it “affects between 3 and 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Children with attention disorder find it difficult to focus on things like homework, but they can concentrate on things they enjoy, such as playing games or watching a favorite cartoon or writing sentences without spelling signs.
These children often get into a lot of trouble because they “get into risky behaviors, fight and challenge authority” to stimulate their brain, because their brain cannot be stimulated by the usual methods.
>>srp_Cyrl<< ADD affects relationships with other peers because other children cannot understand why they behave the way they do or why they write the way they write or that their level of maturity is different.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As the ability to acquire knowledge and learn changed in the above mentioned way, the basic rate at which knowledge was acquired was also changed.
The approach to adopting information was different. The pressure was no longer on the individual recall, but a greater focus was placed on the ability to remember the text.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Essentially, the Renaissance brought a significant change in the approach to learning and dissemination of knowledge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move, carry cargo, or hang around trees.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The hand and foot of a chimpanzee are similar in size and length, which is a reflection of the fact that the hand is used to carry weight when wrist walking.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The human hand is shorter than the foot, and has truer fingerings (phalanges).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fossil hand bones two to three million years old reveal this change in hand specialization from movement to manipulation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some people believe that experiencing a lot of artificially induced lucid dreams can often be very exhausting.
The main reason behind this phenomenon is that lucid dreams increase the length of time between REM states.
With less REM every night, this condition in which you actually experience real sleep and your body renews itself becomes so rare that it starts to pose a problem.
This is as tiring as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes and watching television.
The effect depends on how often per night your brain tries to lucidly dream.
The Italians in North Africa did not do well almost from the outset. Within a week of the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the British 11th Cavalry Regiment occupied Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the chief engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, the governor-general of Libya and apparent successor to Mussolini, was killed by the mistake of Italian anti-aircraft artillery on landing in Tobruk.
Modern sport fencing is played on many levels, from students at the university to professionals and competitors at the Olympics.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The sport is primarily played in a duel format, one swordsman against another.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Golf is a game in which players use bats to insert balls into holes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Eighteen holes are played during the regular round, and players usually start at the first hole on the field and finish at the eighteenth.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The winner is the player who receives the fewest kicks at the end of the game or makes the fewest swings with a bat.
The game is played on grass, and the grass around the hole is cut shorter and is called “green”.
Perhaps the most common form of tourism is what people identify with travel: recreational tourism.
It’s when people travel to a place that offers something quite different from their everyday life to relax and have fun.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Beaches, theme parks, and camping areas are usually the most common places visited by recreational tourists.
If one's goal of traveling to a particular place is to get to know its history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit various sights of a particular country or opt for only one area.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The colonists, seeing this activity, also called reinforcements.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Troops strengthening forward positions included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments of 200 men, led under Colonels John Stark and James Reid (both later became generals).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stark's men took positions along the fence at the northern end of the Colonists' positions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When the tide created a gap along the Mystic River along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north, ending at the edge of the water on a small beach.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Gridley or Stark placed the stake at 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered no one to fire until the recruits passed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The U.S. plan rested on conducting coordinated attacks from three different directions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< General John Codwolder would launch a diversionary attack on the British garrison in Bordentown to prevent reinforcements.
>>srp_Cyrl<< General James Ewing would take 700 militia members across the river at Trenton Ferry, would take over the bridge over the Asanpink stream and would prevent enemy troops from escaping.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The main attacking squad of 2400 men would cross the river nine miles from Trenton, and then split into two groups, one led by Green and one led by Sullivan, to carry out the attack before dawn.
By increasing the distance from a quarter to a half mile, speed begins to play a much smaller role, and endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Of course, a first-class half-mile runner, a man who can run the track in less than two minutes, must possess considerable speed, but endurance must develop at every opportunity.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some running by nature during the winter combined with gymnastic exercises for the upper body is the best preparation for the running season.
Proper eating habits can not lead to the best performance on their own, but they can significantly affect the overall condition of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, applying effective hydration habits, and understanding the different aspects of supplementation can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of sports.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Running on the middle tracks is a relatively cheap sport; however, there are many misconceptions about several parts of the equipment you need to participate.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Products can be purchased as needed, but most will have little or no effect on performance at all.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even when it does not provide real benefits.
>>srp_Cyrl<< An atom can be considered one of the basic units of building all matter.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is a very complex whole which, according to the simplified Bohr model, consists of a central nucleus around which electrons orbit, somewhat similar to planets orbiting the Sun - see Figure 1.1.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Protons have a positive charge while neutrons have no charge. Electrons have a negative charge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< To check the victim, you must first examine the scene to ensure your safety.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You must note the victim's position as you approach it as well as any automatic warning signs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you hurt yourself in trying to help, it will only make the situation worse.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Research has shown that depression, fear, and presenting the situation disastrously affect the link between pain and disability in those suffering from lower back pain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Only the effects of disaster, not depression and fear, were a condition for regular weekly structured physical activity
Those who participate in regular activities have required more support, when it comes to negative perceptions of pain, distinguishing chronic pain and a feeling of discomfort from normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or eyes.
There are many different eye structures, which vary in complexity depending on the requirements of the organism.
Different constructions have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different degrees of sensitivity, and also require different processing modes to understand the input elements and different numbers to work optimally.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A population is a set of organisms of a particular species within a given geographical area.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When all individuals in a population are identical in terms of a particular phenotypic trait, they are known as monomorphic.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When individuals show several variants of a particular characteristic, they are polymorphic.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Army colony ant marches and also nests at different stages.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the nomadic phase, the ants soldiers march at night, and during the day they take a break and form a camp.
The colony begins its nomadic phase when available food is reduced. During this phase, the colony makes temporary anthills that change every day.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These nomadic migrations or marches generally last about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word “cella”, meaning “small room”, and was first coined by a microscopist who observed the structure of the cork.
>>srp_Cyrl<< a cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and necessary to explore life, so much so, that they are often called “building blocks of life.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to keep blood flow going and flowing undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent all over the body so quickly, which helps to preserve the body from potential threats.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tornadoes hit small areas compared to other devastating storms, but they can destroy anything that gets in their way.
Tornadoes pluck trees from the roots, tear boards from buildings and lift cars into the sky. Only two percent of tornadoes are the most destructive and last more than three hours.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The wind of these monster storms goes up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles per hour).
>>srp_Cyrl<< People have been making and using lenses to enlarge for thousands and thousands of years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the first true telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to allow distant objects to act both closer and larger.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and the nature of cooperation is such that when most benefit, in the short term they will always gain more by acting selfishly.
Hopefully, most people will realize that in the long run their best option is to work together with others.
Many people dream of the day when people will be able to travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people wonder what is out there, and some believe that aliens or other forms of life may live on another planet.
But if this ever actually happens, it probably won’t happen for a long time. The stars are so far scattered that between the stars are “neighbors” trillions of miles.
Perhaps one day your great-grandchildren will stand in an unknown world wondering about their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made up of a large number of cells. They eat things and digest them from the inside. Most animals can move.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Only animals have brains (though not all animals; jellyfish, for example, have no brains).
There's animals everywhere on the planet, digging on the ground, swimming in the oceans and flying in the sky.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism (being).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The word cell comes from the Latin word cella, with the meaning of a small room.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are made of small squares or balls.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, spotted small squares on the cork using a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to look at dead cells
>>srp_Cyrl<< Elements and compounds can be transferred from one state to another without changing.
Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example. The water compound consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it is a gas, a liquid, or a solid.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although his physical condition may change, his chemical condition remains the same.
Time is something that is all around us and affects everything we do, yet is hard to understand.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Time has been talked about for thousands of years by religious, philosophical, and scientific scientists.
We experience time as a series of events that pass from the future to the present and into the past.
With the help of time we compare the duration (length) of events.
You can record the flow of time yourself by observing the repetition of cyclical events. A cyclical event is something that happens regularly over and over again.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Computers are now used to process images and videos.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sophisticated animations can be made on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly used on television and film.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, who hunted giant birds called moe.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The theory then established the thesis that the Moors had migrated from Polynesia to the Grand Fleet and had taken over New Zealand from Moriora, creating an agricultural society.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, and developed their special, peaceful culture there.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There was also another tribe in the Chatham Islands; it was the Moors who emigrated from New Zealand.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They called themselves the Moriori, and after several skirmishes, the Moriori were wiped off the face of the Earth.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Individuals who have been involved for several decades have helped us appreciate our strengths and passion while openly assessing difficulties and even failures.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Listening to how individuals share their individual, family, and organization stories, we gained valuable insight into the past and some of the personalities that have influenced the organization's culture well or badly.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although understanding one's history does not imply understanding the culture, it does help people gain a sense of where their place is in the history of that organization.
>>srp_Cyrl<< While assessing successes and becoming aware of failures, individuals and the entire set of participants discover the values, mission, and driving forces of the organization more deeply.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In this case, recalling previous cases of entrepreneurial behavior and resulting successes helped people be open to new changes and a new direction of the local church.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Such success stories have lessened the fear of change, while creating a positive tendency towards change in the future.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Convergent thinking patterns are problem-solving techniques that unite different ideas or areas in order to find solutions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The focus of this way of thinking is speed, logic and precision, as well as identifying facts, re-applying existing techniques, gathering information.
The most important factor of this way of thinking is: that there is only one correct answer. Think only of two answers, namely correct or wrong.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking think logically, have the ability to memorize patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Humans are by far the most talented species in reading other people's thoughts.
This means that we are able to successfully predict what other people feel, intend, believe, know or want.
Among these abilities, understanding the intentions of others is key. It allows us to resolve possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you saw someone smashing a car window, you’d probably assume they were trying to steal an unknown man’s car.
He should be judged differently if he loses his car keys and tries to break into his own car.
>>srp_Cyrl<< MRT is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered by Felix Bloch in 1930 (working at Stanford University) and Edward Percell (of Harvard University).
>>srp_Cyrl<< In this resonance, magnetic field and radio waves make atoms release small radio signals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Raymond Damadian, a physician and scientific researcher, discovered in 1970 the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Four years later, the patent was granted, and it was the first published patent in the field of MRT (Magnetic Resonant Tomography) in the world.
Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first “whole body” MRI scanner in 1977, and called it “Untrammelable”.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Asynchronous communication provides time for reflection and reaction towards others.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It allows students the ability to work at their own pace and to have control over the pace of the instructions.
In addition, there are fewer time constraints with the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
>>srp_Cyrl<< The use of the Internet and the world communications network allows constant access to information to those who wish to learn.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Students can also deliver questions to instructors at any time of the day and can expect fairly quick answers, instead of waiting until the next consultation term.
The postmodernist approach to learning propagates freedom from absolutes. There are more good ways to learn.
In fact, there is not only one good thing to learn. Learning takes place in the interaction between the one who is learning and the knowledge before him.
Our current experience with all of this “do it yourself” and presentation of information, learning-based television shows well show the point.
So many of us watch television shows that inform us about processes or experiences in which we will never participate, nor will we ever apply that knowledge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We will never overhaul a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to examine ancient ruins or redecorate a neighbor's house.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Thanks to underwater cable connections to optical fibres to Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected to 93% of the population who have Internet access.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Your hotel or hosts (if you are staying in a boarding house or private house) are likely to have wireless internet or a computer connected to the Internet, and all settlements have an Internet cafe or some location with public wireless internet.
As mentioned above, although the word “Eskimo” is still acceptable in the United States, many non-American Arctic peoples, especially in Canada, find it derogatory.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although you can hear that word in the speech of Greenlandic natives, foreigners should avoid it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Old People of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalalek (plural Kalalit), Greenlanders, in Greenland.
Crime and, in general, animosity towards foreigners, practically do not exist in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "dangerous areas".
Cold weather may be the only real danger faced by those who are unprepared.
If you visit Greenland during the cold season (taking into account that the further north you go, the colder it will be), the basic thing is to bring warm enough clothes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Very long summer days can lead to problems of not getting enough sleep and to all other related health problems.
Pay attention to the Nordic mosquitoes during the summer. Although they do not transmit any diseases, they can be irritating.
Although San Francisco’s economy is linked to the fact that it is a world-class tourist attraction, its economy is diverse.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The largest sectors in terms of employment are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Frequent screening in music, movies, literature and popular culture helped make the city and its landmarks famous worldwide.
>>srp_Cyrl<< San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with many hotels, restaurants, and top convention facilities.
>>srp_Cyrl<< San Francisco is also considered among the people as one of the best places for other Asian cuisines: Korean, Taiwanese, Indian and Japanese.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The trip to Disneyland represents the main pilgrimage of many American families.
The “usual” visit includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus ride to the Disney Hotel, a stay there for approximately a week without leaving the Disney property and returning home.
There are an infinite number of possible variations, but this is still what most people mean when they mention “going to Walt Disney World.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many tickets sold online through auction sites, such as eBay or Craigslist, are partially used multi-day tickets valid for multiple parks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although this is a very common activity, Disney has banned: tickets cannot be passed on to others.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For any camping under the rim in the Grand Canyon of Colorado, permission is required for a field trip in rural regions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The number of permits is limited to protect the canyon, and are available on the first day of the month, four months in advance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Therefore, permission to visit the rural area for any date in May becomes available on January 1.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Spaces of the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel Camper Space, just off Phantom Ranch, are usually filled with requests as early as the first day since they have been opened for reservations.
There are a limited number of permits reserved for those seeking them on arrival, which are available under the principle of “first come, first served”.
Getting by car to South Africa is a great way to see all the beauty of the region as well as to get to places that are not on ordinary tourist routes.
This is feasible with an ordinary car with careful planning, but a four-wheel-drive car is especially recommended, and many locations can be accessed exclusively with a vehicle that has a large axle distance and 4x4 drive.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Keep in mind as you plan to do so that, although South Africa is stable, not all neighbouring countries are stable.
Visa requirements and its prices vary from country to country and depend on the country you come from.
Each country has unique laws that determine what emergency items you must have in your car.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Victoria Falls is a town in the western part of Zimbabwe, across from Livingston in Zambia and near Botswana.
The town is located right next to the waterfalls, which are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers many opportunities for longer stay and adventurers and those who visit the sights.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the rainy season (November to March) the volume of water will be higher, and the waterfalls more dramatic.
You will certainly get wet if you cross the bridge or take a stroll along the winding paths by the waterfall.
On the other hand, just because the volume of water is so large, you will not be able to see the waterfalls so clearly - because of all that water!
The Tutankhamun Tomb (KV62). KV62 is perhaps the most famous tomb in the Valley, the scene of Howard Carter's discovery in 1922, the almost intact royal tomb of a young king.
However, compared to many other royal tombs, Tutankhamun’s tomb is hardly worth a visit, as it is much smaller and with limited decorations.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Anyone interested in seeing evidence of damage to the mummy that occurred during the attempted extraction from the coffin, will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders are visible.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The tomb's basal treasure is no longer located within it, but has been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For visitors who have limited time it would be best to spend their time somewhere else.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Phnom Krom is situated 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This hill temple was erected in the late 9th century, during the reign of King Yasorwaman.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The dark atmosphere in the temple and the view of Lake Tonle Sap make the climb to the hill worth the effort.
A visit to the place can be conveniently combined with a boat trip to the lake.
A pass for Angkor is needed to get into the temple, so don’t forget to take your passport with you when heading for Tonle Sapi.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although most other countries, as well as the United Nations, do not recognize it as Israel's capital.
The fascinating history of this ancient city in the Judean Hills goes back thousands of years.
This city is a holy city of three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The religious importance of the city, and in particular many places in the Old City area, make Jerusalem one of the major tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, along with lively and crowded shopping malls, cafes and restaurants.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ecuador requires that the citizens of Cuba receive an invitation letter before they enter Ecuador through international airports or border crossings.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This letter must be legalized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador, and must meet certain conditions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These requirements were created to allow an organized flow of migration between both countries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Citizens of Cuba who have a U.S. green card should visit Ecuador's consulate to obtain an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid at least 6 months after the date of travel. To prove the length of your stay, you need a return/order card.
Tours are cheaper for larger groups, so if you’re single or just with one friend, try to meet other people and form a group of four to six people for a better price per person.
However, you really don’t need to worry about this, as tourists often redeploy to fill cars.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It seems to be actually a way to trick people into believing that they have to pay more.
>>srp_Cyrl<< High over the northern part of Machu Picchu rises a steep mountain, which is often the backdrop of many photographs of the ruins.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It looks a bit scary from below, and the climb is steep and heavy, but most average physically ready people should make it in about 45 minutes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stone stairs are set along the trail, and on steeper parts steel cables provide a handrail as a support.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It has been said, expect to run out of air, and take care in steeper parts, especially when they are wet, since it can become dangerous very quickly.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There is a small cave on top that must be passed through; it is quite low and narrow.
The wild world and places on the Galapagos are best seen from the ship, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships sail the waters of the Galapagos - they are of different sizes and receive from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their place in advance (since the ships are usually full in the heat of the season).
Make sure that the agent through which you book is a specialist in Galapagos and with good knowledge of a wide range of ships.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This will ensure that your special interests and/or limitations coincide with the ship that is most appropriate to them.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas, while the indigenous Araucans (Mapuches) inhabited central and southern Chile.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Mapuche were one of the last independent American indigenous groups, not fully assimilated into Spanish-speaking rules until Chile became an independent state.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (amidst the Napoleonic Wars that left Spain without a functioning central government for several years), a decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Dominican Republic (Spanish: Republica Dominicana) is a Caribbean state that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to white sand beaches and mountain scenery, the country is home to the oldest European city in America, which is now part of Santo Domingo.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The island was first settled by the Taini and Caribbean. the Caribbean were people who spoke the Arawak language, and who arrived on the island around 10,000 BC.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the course of a few short years after the arrival of European explorers, the Spanish conquerors significantly reduced the number of Tain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to Frye Bartolomei de las Casas ("Tratado de las Indias"), between 1492 and 1498 the Spanish invaders killed about 100,000 Tain.
Garden de la Union. This place was created as an atrium of monasteries dating from the 17th century, and whose only preserved building is the Temple of St. Diego.
It now functions as a central square and there are always a lot of things happening on it, day and night.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are many restaurants in the surrounding garden, and in the afternoon and evening, free concerts are held under the central canopy (gazebo).
Calyechon del Beso (Street of Kiss). Two balconies between which only 69 centimeters are the place of old love legends.
The kids will tell you a story.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bowen Island is popular for a day trip or weekend excursion, and offers kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants and more.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This authentic community is situated in Howe Sound just outside Vancouver, and can be easily reached by water taxis which operate on an established schedule from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who enjoy outdoor activities, a trip along the sea to the Sky Corridor is a must.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Wisler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but is known for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Enjoy some of the best skiing in North America in winter, and try authentic mountain biking in summer.
Permits must be booked in advance. You must have a permit to stay overnight in Sirena.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The siren is the only ranger station offering overnight services and hot meals compared to camping. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer camping without food services.
It is possible to get park tickets directly at a ranger station in Puerto Jimenez, but they do not accept credit cards
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Park Service (MINAE) does not issue park permits for more than a month prior to the scheduled arrival.
>>srp_Cyrl<< CafeNet El Sol offers a booking service with a US$30 fee, or US$10 for one-day passes; details are on their Corcovado page.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Cook Islands are an island country that is in free alliance with New Zealand, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is an archipelago with fifteen (15) islands spanning 2.2 million km2 of ocean.
Being in the same time zone as Hawaii, these islands are sometimes considered "New Zealand Hawaii".
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although smaller, they remind some older visitors of Hawaii of a time before statehood, a time without large tourist hotels and other development facilities.
There are no cities in the Cook Islands, but they are made up of 15 different islands. The most important are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Today, in developed countries, the provision of deluxe bed-and-breakfast services has been raised almost to the level of art.
The best facilities that provide bed and breakfast certainly compete mainly in two main things: bed and breakfast.
Therefore, in the best facilities of its kind can be found the most luxurious bedding, perhaps a handmade quilt or an antique bed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Breakfast may include seasonal treats from a given area or the host's specialty.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The surround can be an old historic old building with antiquarian furniture, a meticulously maintained courtyard and swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and moving on a long journey has an essential appeal in its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you’re probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limitations.
Placing a tent of any size on private property or in the city can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, using a car is a great way to go on a trip, but rarely in itself is it a way to “camp.”
Camping by car is possible if you have a spacious minivan, a field car, a Sedan or a caravan with seats that can be lowered.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some hotels possess heritage from the golden age of steam railways and ocean ships; before World War II, in the 19th or early 20th century.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Those hotels were frequented by the rich and famous of the time, and often had both fine food and nightlife.
Old-fashioned equipment, lack of the latest amenities and a certain graceful age are also part of their character.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although they are usually private property, they sometimes serve as accommodation for state officials and other respectable people.
A traveler with a lot of money could consider flying around the world, interspersed with stays in many of these hotels.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Hospitality Exchange Network is an organization that connects travelers with locals in the cities they want to visit.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Joining such a network usually only requires filling out an online form; although some networks offer or require additional confirmation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The list of existing hosts is available in print and/or online, sometimes with recommendations and assessments from other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 after computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland, but did not find a place to stay.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He sent emails to students at the local university and received a huge number of offers for free accommodation.
Hostels are primarily intended for young people - a typical guest is in his twenties - but there you can also often find older travelers there.
Families with children rarely meet, but some hostels still allow them to be in private rooms.
Beijing, China, will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, becoming the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies, and indoor ice competitions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Other skiing events will be at the Taizicheng Ski Resort in Zhangjako, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most temples have an annual festival beginning in late November and lasting until mid-May, which differs depending on each temple's annual calendar.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most temple festivals are celebrated as part of the temple's anniversary or the birthday of the supreme deity or other major temple-related events.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Kerala Temple Festivals are very interesting to see, with a regular procession of decorated elephants, a temple orchestra and other festivities.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The World's Fair (also known as the World Exhibition, or simply the Expo) is a major international science and art festival.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The participating countries set up art and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to present problems in the world or the culture and history of their country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< International exhibitions in the field of horticulture are specialized events depicting floral arrangements, botanical gardens and anything else that has to do with plants.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although theoretically they can be held every year (as long as they are in different countries), they are not held in practice.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These manifestations usually last from three to six months and are held in locations of at least 50 hectares in area.
Over the years, a variety of different film formats have been used. The most commonly used is the standard film of 35 mm (negative dimensions 36-24 mm).
>>srp_Cyrl<< It can generally be fairly easily updated if you run out, and gives a resolution almost comparable to the current DSLR.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Individual medium format film cameras use a 6 by 6 cm format, more specifically a 56 by 56 mm negative.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This gives almost 4 times the resolution of negatives of 35 mm (3136 mm2 versus 864).
The wild world is one of the most challenging motives for a photographer, and it needs a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Wildlife photography is often taken for granted, but as with photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Photographing wildlife often requires long teleobjects, though, say, for flocks of birds or small creatures, different objects are needed.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules about photographing for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, including more than twenty spoken by 50 or more million speakers.
It is also easier to understand written words than spoken ones. This is especially true of addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Members of entire nations speak English completely fluently, and more and more people are speaking it to a limited extent - especially in the younger population.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Imagine, if you will, a Manquinian, a resident of Boston, a Jamaican, and a resident of Sydney sitting at a table having dinner at a restaurant in Toronto.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They entertain each other with stories from their birthplaces, told by their specific accents and using local slang.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to feed yourself. However, without cooking conditions, choices are limited to ready-made food.
Supermarkets in increasing numbers are getting compartments with a larger selection of ready-made food. Some even have microwave ovens or provide other ways to keep food warm.
In some countries or types of shops, there is at least one restaurant on the site, often quite informal and with affordable prices.
Make and carry with you copies of your policy and contact details of your insurer.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They must show the email address and international numbers of the insured's phone for advice/authorization and seeking damages.
Keep another copy in your luggage and online (send an email to yourself with the attachment, or save it in the “cloud”).
If you are carrying a laptop or tablet on your trip, save a copy in its memory or disk (which can be accessed without internet connection).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Also give copies of the guidelines/contacts to companions and relatives or friends at home who want to help.
Moose (also known as wapiti) are not essentially aggressive, but will defend themselves if they perceive something as a threat.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When people do not perceive moose as potentially dangerous, they can get too close to it and put themselves at risk.
Moderately drink alcoholic beverages. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and knowing your own limit is very important.
Possible long-term health consequences of excessive alcohol consumption can include liver damage and even blindness and death. The potential danger increases when drinking illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal alcoholic beverages can contain a variety of dangerous impurities including methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses can be cheaper in a foreign country, especially in low-income countries, where the cost of labor is lower.
Consider doing an eye exam at home, especially if it’s covered by insurance, and taking the recipe with you to seduce it elsewhere.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Frames of top-notch brands available in such areas may have two problems; some may be false, and real imported ones may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the most traded items in the world, and you can probably find many species in the area where you live.
Nevertheless, there are many different ways to drink coffee in the world, which is worth a try.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Canyoning (or: canyoning) involves going to the bottom of a canyon that is either dry or filled with water.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sports - traveling canyons, combines elements of swimming, climbing, and jumping - but requires relatively little training or physical constitution to begin with (compared to rock climbing, diving, or alpine skiing, for example).
Walking is an outdoor activity consisting of walking in a natural environment, often hiking trails.
Day hikes include distances that are less than a mile away to greater distances that can be traversed within a day.
Daily walks on a light path do not require special preparation and every person of moderate fitness will enjoy them.
Families with young children may need more preparation, but spending a day outdoors is easily feasible even with babies and preschoolers.
There are almost 200 organizations in the world that deal with racing tours. Most of them operate independently.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As a successor to Global Ranning Tours, Gou Ranning Tours connects dozens of race excursion service providers on four continents.
>>srp_Cyrl<< With roots in Barcelona's Tours of running Barcelona and Copenhagen's Run Copenhagen, she was quickly joined by Tours of Running Prague based in Prague and others.
There are many things to consider before and during a trip somewhere.
When traveling, don’t expect things to be like “at home.” The ways, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, standards, language, and more will vary somewhat from where you live.
This is something you must always keep in mind, to avoid disappointment or perhaps even dislike of local ways to do something.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good option for travel that is beyond the traveler’s previous experience in terms of nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
While most agencies are willing to accept most ordinary reservations, many agents specialize in special types of travel, budget ranges, and destinations.
It is better to use an agent who often book trips similar to yours.
See which travel agent promotes, whether on the site, or in the window.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you want to see the world cheaply, out of need, lifestyle, or challenge, there are some ways to do it.
Basically, they fall into two categories: either work while traveling, or try to limit your expenses. This article focuses on the latter.
For those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability to cut costs almost to zero, check out the trips with a minimal budget.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is advised that passengers do not steal, trespass, participate in illegal markets, beg, or in any other way use other people for their own good.
>>srp_Cyrl<< An immigration checkpoint is usually the first stop after disembarking from an aircraft, ship, or other means of transport.
In some trains that cross borders, checks take place on a moving train, and you should have a valid ID on you when boarding one of these trains.
In trains where you sleep at night, passports can be collected by a conductor, so you will not be interrupted by sleep.
An application is an additional requirement for the process of obtaining a visa. In some countries, you must report your presence and the address at which you are staying with local authorities.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This may require filling out a form at a local police station or that you will need to visit an immigration office.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In many countries with this kind of law, local hotels will take care of the application (be sure to ask).
In other cases, only those staying outside of tourist accommodation should apply. However, this makes the law much more vague, so find out in advance.
Architecture concerns the design and construction of buildings. The very architecture of a place often represents a tourist attraction.
Many buildings are quite beautiful to look at, and the view from a tall building or from a cleverly placed window can be a beauty to behold.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The architecture overlaps considerably with other areas, including urban planning, construction, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given how far away many pueblos are, you won’t be able to find a significant amount of nightlife without traveling to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casino clubs on the list below serve drinks, and some of them also bring entertainment in the form of well-known brands (mostly the big ones that are right near Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: bars in small towns are not always good places for visitors from other countries to stay.
One thing, northern New Mexico has significant problems with driving under the influence of alcohol, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high near bars in small towns.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Unwanted murals and scribbling are known as graffiti.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although it is far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with youth who vandalize public and private property using colors in spray.
However, today there are official graffiti artists, graffiti events and “legal” walls. Graffiti paintings in this context more often resemble works of art than illegible marks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Throwing a boomerang is a popular skill that many tourists want to acquire.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you want to learn to throw a boomerang back into your hand, make sure you have a suitable boomerang to return.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most boomerangs available in Australia do not actually return. Beginners are advised not to try to throw them away when it is windy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hangi dish is being prepared under the clock.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The pit is heated either by hot stones from the fire or in some places geothermal heat makes areas of soil naturally hot.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hangy is often used to prepare dinner with baking in the traditional style.
Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi dishes, while other hangi dishes can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
>>srp_Cyrl<< MetroPruga has two classes on suburban trains within and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as First Class) and Metro (called Third Class).
>>srp_Cyrl<< MetroPlus is more comfortable and has fewer crowds in it, but is a bit more expensive, although it is still cheaper than the price of normal metro tickets in Europe.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro wagons; MetroPlus wagons are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Wearing for others - Never let your bag out of your sight, especially when crossing international borders.
Someone can use you to smuggle drugs without your knowledge, which can get you into a lot of trouble.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This includes waiting in line, as tracker dogs can be engaged at any time without notice.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some countries have excessive draconian sentences even for the first offences; they may include prison sentences over 10 years or death.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bags left unattended are a target for theft, and may also attract the attention of officials, who are cautious when it comes to bomb threats.
At home, due to the constant exposure to local microbes, there is a very high chance that you are already immune to them.
But in other parts of the world, where the bacteriological fauna is not known to you, you are more likely to have problems.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Also, in warmer climates, bacteria grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hence the plagues of travel sickness called Delhi Diarrhea, Pharaoh's Curses, Montezuma's Revenge, and many of their friends.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As with respiratory problems in colder climates, intestinal problems are quite common in warm climates and in many cases are extremely strenuous, but not really dangerous.
If you are traveling to a developing country for the first time - or to a new part of the world - do not underestimate the possible cultural shock.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many stable, capable travelers have been mastered by the novelty of travel to developing countries, where many small cultural adjustments can quickly accumulate.
During the first days, especially consider spending on Western-style hotels and quality, food and services, which can help you adjust.
Do not sleep on a mattress or ground surface in areas where you do not know the local fauna.
If you are going to camp outside, bring a sleeping bag or net to keep away snakes, scorpions and the like.
Fill your home with rich coffee in the morning and some relaxing chamomile tea in the evening.
When you are on vacation near home, you have time to deal with yourself and spend a few extra minutes to come up with something special.
If you feel adventurous, take the opportunity to create or blend some smoothies:
You may discover a simple drink you can make for breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don’t visit often.
For those unfamiliar with medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious have different meanings.
Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi or other parasites.
>>srp_Cyrl<< An infectious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted when you are near an infected person.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many governments require that visitors entering or residents leaving their country be vaccinated against a range of diseases.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These requirements will often depend on which countries the passenger has visited or intends to visit.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One of the strong sides of the city of Charlotte in North Carolina is that it offers an abundance of quality options for family life.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Residents from other areas often cite benefits for the whole family as a basic reason to move there, and visitors often note that one can easily enjoy being in the city together with children.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the past 20 years, the number of options adapted to children in Upper Charlotte has grown exponentially.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Families in Charlotte generally do not use taxis, although they may be of use in some circumstances.
There is a surcharge for more than 2 passengers, so this option could be more expensive than needed.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical fitness, can only be made during the flight from November to February, and are mostly limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Several thousand employees live here in some fifty bases in the summer, mostly in those areas; a small number remain over the winter.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The interior of Antarctica is a deserted plateau covered with 2-3 km of ice.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Occasional specialist plane tours go inland, for hiking or to get to the Pole which has a large base.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The South Pole Trail (or Highway) is a 1600 km long trail from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
It is compacted snow with filled cracks and marked with flags. It can only be driven by special tractors, which pull the sled with fuel and supplies.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They are not very nimble, so the trail must have a long detour around the Transantarctic Mountains to get out onto the highlands.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The most common cause of accidents in winter are slippery roads, sidewalks (trots), and especially stairs.
The least you need is shoes with the appropriate sole. Summer footwear is usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are unsuitable.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material soft enough at cold temperatures.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some boots have krampons, and there is additional equipment with krampons for slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes and boots, for heels or heels and soles.
Heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often thrown on roads or paths to improve adhesion.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Avalanches are not an abnormality; steep slopes can only retain a certain amount of snow, and anything that goes over it will collapse in the form of an avalanche.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The problem is that the snow is sticky, so it needs to be started a little bit in order to fall off, and the part of the snow that falls can run the rest.
Sometimes the original trigger is precisely the sun that warms the snow, sometimes it is more precipitation in the form of snow, sometimes some other natural events, and often man.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A tornado is a spinning pole with very low air pressure, which sucks the surrounding air inward and upward.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They form strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them as the tornado moves.
They begin as “lefties” who descend from the storm clouds and become a “tornade” when they touch the ground.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Personal VPN (virtual private network) providers are a great way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
They are superior to web proxies for several reasons: They redirect all internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer higher bandwidth and better quality of service. They are encrypted, and it is more difficult to spy on them.
Media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this, claiming it is because of “preventing piracy.”
Regional codes actually have no effect on illegal copying; a disk copied by bit-by-bit works quite well on all the devices that the original works on.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The actual purpose is to give those companies more control over the market; it's all about turning money around.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since calls take place over the Internet, you do not have to use a telephone company located in the place where you live or where you travel.
There is no requirement to get a local number in the community you live in; you can get a satellite internet connection in the wild of Chikina, Alaska, and pick the number you are in sunny Arizona.
In many cases, you have to separately purchase a global number that allows you to receive calls from a PSTN phone. That’s where the number makes a difference to those who call you.
Real-time text translation applications - applications that can automatically translate entire segments of text from one language to another.
Some of the apps in this category can even translate texts in foreign languages, to signs or other real-world items when the user directs the smartphone to those items.
Translation machines have improved drastically, and now they give more or less accurate translations (rare nonsense), but caution is needed since they still sometimes mistranslate completely.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One of the most prominent applications in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading data about the desired language.
Using mobile GPS apps can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when you are out of your country.
It can save you more money than when you buy maps for GPS, or a stand-alone GPS device or when you rent the same from a car rental company.
If you do not have a connection to transfer data on your phone, or if you do not have a network, their operation may be limited or unavailable.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Each local store is packed with a confusing multitude of prepaid phone cards that can be used from public pay phones or ordinary phones.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although most cards are good for calls made to anywhere, some specialize in providing affordable call pricing services to certain groups of countries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Access to these services is often via a free phone number that can be called from most phones at no charge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rules relating to ordinary photography also apply to video shooting and even more.
If just photographing something is not allowed, then you should not even think of taking a video.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you are using a drone, check in advance what you are allowed to record and what licenses or additional licenses you need.
Managing a drone near an airport or above a crowd of people is almost always a bad idea, even if it’s not illegal in your area.
Nowadays, air travel is very rarely booked directly at the airline without prior search and price comparison.
Sometimes the same flight can have very different prices on different websites and it pays to compare search results, as well as look at the price on the airline’s website itself before you book.
While you may need a visa for short visits to certain countries when you travel as a tourist or work, going there as an international student usually requires a longer stay than going as an ordinary tourist.
Generally speaking, staying in any foreign country for a long period of time requires that you obtain a visa in advance.
Student visas usually have different requirements and procedures for applying from ordinary tourist or work visas.
For most countries, you will need a letter offering places from the institution where you want to study, as well as evidence of livelihoods, at least for the first year of your course.
Contact the institution, as well as the immigration department of the country where you want to study, to get more detailed requirements.
If you are not a diplomat, working abroad usually means that you will have to report income tax in the country where you are based.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Income tax is structured differently in different states, and tax rates and tax classes vary a lot from one country to another.
In some federal states, such as the United States and Canada, income taxes are levied at both the federal and local levels, so rates and tax bases can vary from region to region.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although immigration checks usually do not have or it is a formality when you arrive in your homeland, customs control may constitute a hassle.
Be sure to inform yourself about what you are allowed to do and what you are not allowed to enter and report anything that exceeds legal restrictions.
The easiest way to start writing travelogues is to hone your skills on some well-known travel blog website.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After you get used to formatting and editing on the web, you can create your own website.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Volunteering on a trip is a great way to change something, however it is not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to meet different cultures, meet new people, learn about yourself, get a different perspective and even acquire new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch the budget to allow for a longer stay in a place, since many volunteer jobs provide accommodation and stay, and some receive a small salary.
Vikings used Russian waterways to get to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Parts of these waterways can still be used. Check to see if special permits may be needed, which may be difficult to obtain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Northern Ice Ocean with the Baltic Sea, via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mainly via rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to Volga, so it is still possible to reach it from the Caspian Sea via Russia.
Rest assured that as soon as you reach the pier, everything will be pretty obvious. You will meet other boat hitchhikers and they will share their information with you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Basically, you'll post notifications in which you offer your help, you'll walk the pier, you'll approach people who clean their yachts, you'll try to make contact with sailors in bars etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you and will give you hints about which boat is looking for someone.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You should carefully choose an airline for frequent flying within the alliance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although you may think it is intuitive to join the airline you fly the most, you should be aware that the privileges offered are often different, and the points for frequent flyers are perhaps higher at another airline within the same alliance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Airlines like Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their services to Africa, and offer connections to many major African cities at more competitive prices compared to other European airlines.
Turkish Airlines has been flying to 39 destinations in 30 African countries since 2014.
If you have extra time to travel, try to compare your total ticket price to Africa with the ticket price to travel around the world.
Do not forget to include the additional costs of additional visas, outbound taxes, transportation on land, etc. for all those places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world only in the southern hemisphere, your choice of flights and destinations is limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No airline alliance covers all 3 ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not cover any of the crossings).
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Star Alliance covers all but the eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which covers the flight of LATAM Vanworld.
This flight is not the only option if you want to bypass the South Pacific and the west coast of South America.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan waged war against the Azeris in 1994.
With the help of Armenia, a new republic was created. However, no existing state - not even Armenia - recognizes it.
Diplomatic disputes over the region continue to erode relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Canal County (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a famous 17th-century district surrounding Amsterdam's Binenstad.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The entire district is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, due to its unique cultural and historical value, and the values of its property are among the highest in the country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Chinque Tere, meaning five countries, consists of five small coastal villages - Ryomaggiore, Manarola, Cornilloi, Vernca and Monteroso - located in the Italian area of Liguria.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They are listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on uneven, steep areas along cliffs overlooking the sea.
Part of the charm of this place is that there is no visible corporate development. Trails, trains and boats connect villages, while cars do not have access from the outside.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The varieties of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are slightly different from French spoken in France, although they are similar enough to be mutually intelligible.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Especially numbering systems in the French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland have some minor peculiarities that distinguish them from French in France, and the pronunciation of individual words is somewhat different.
Regardless, all Belgians and Swiss speaking French were taught standard French at school, so they could understand you if you used the standard French number system.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In many countries of the world, waving is a friendly gesture meaning "hello".
However, in Malaysia, even among Malays in rural areas, it means “come here”, which is similar to the index finger bent towards the body, which is a sign used in certain Western countries, and which should be used only for this purpose.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Similarly, a British passenger in Spain may misunderstand waving when leaving with the palm facing the person waving (not the person waving) as a gesture to return.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Auxiliary languages are artificial or planning languages, created with the intention of facilitating communication between people who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are separate from “lingua francas”, which are natural or organic languages that for some particular reason become dominant as a means of communication among speakers of other languages.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the heat of the day, travelers may have mirages that give them the illusion of water (or other things).
This can be dangerous if the passenger follows the mirage, consuming precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest desert can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk without warm clothes.
Especially in summer you need to watch out for mosquitoes if you decide to walk through the rainforest.
Even if you are driving through a subtropical rain forest, a few seconds with the door open as you enter the vehicle is enough time for mosquitoes to get into the vehicle with you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bird flu, or more formally avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fewer than a thousand cases were recorded in humans, but some of them were fatal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most cases were of people working with poultry, but there is a certain risk to birdwatchers as well.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For Norway, steep fjords and valleys are characteristic, after which high, more or less flat highlands suddenly extend.
These highlands are often called "sights" meaning wide, open space without trees, boundless expanse.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In Rogaland and Agder, they are commonly called "hey", meaning a treeless swamp often covered with heath.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Only a few airlines still offer tickets for mourners that slightly lower last-minute travel costs in the event of a funeral.
