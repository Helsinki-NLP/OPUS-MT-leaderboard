Welsh members of the assembly are concerned about the "similarity with the Muppets"
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some Members of the Assembly (AM) are overjoyed by the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
>>srp_Cyrl<< This came about because the name of the assembly is planned to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all political parties worry that they may become a laughingstock.
One member of the Labour Party said his party was concerned that the abbreviation "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
>>srp_Cyrl<< For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means goofy, and pwp means droppings.
A member of the assembly from the Plaid political party said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A Welsh member of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the MWP is pronounced similar to Muppets.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on the draft law on the introduction of name changes, made the following statement: "The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In June, the Commission announced the results of public consultations on generally accepted proposals for the appointment of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When it comes to the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission opted for the option Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the widest support in public consultations.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Members of the assembly are proposing alternative options, but a struggle to reach a consensus could give a headache to the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft law on change within a few weeks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Reform laws will also cover other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualification of assembly members and a plan of the committee system.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Members of the assembly will eventually vote for their own title during the debate over the said bill.
Macedonians hold referendum on changing country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether they accept the new name of the state "Republic of North Macedonia".
>>srp_Cyrl<< A popular vote was organized in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of the neighboring northern state represents the claim of its territory and has steadfastly opposed its EU and NATO membership requirements.
Macedonian President Djordje Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognise the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
>>srp_Cyrl<< St. Martin's bells have been silenced, and churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
“The old people I spoke to say that there used to be cafes and churches on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“There’s no one else today.”
The coffee shop's disappearance is understandable.
“People hang out differently today,” he says.
“The cafes no longer have the role of living quarters from the neighborhoods that people regularly go to.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the managers expect “and sooner or later it will be back to square one.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of the kind of people who would not help the remaining sanctuaries from the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and that will speed up the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that most of those people who move into these apartment buildings will become their members.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Both churches were built by communities composed of whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The original community of white Methodists moved away in the 1930s.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The black community that performed worship nearby took ownership of the building.
>>srp_Cyrl<< St. Martin's was taken over by the black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The 1939 fire caused major damage to the building, but since Father Johnson's parishioners decided to restore it, they commissioned an organ.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ "the organ of the poor".
An expert who played the organ in July called them different: “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that they were the first organ in the world to be played by some black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger organ at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mr. Merryweather stated that St. Martin did not replace him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< What has taken place in the last few months in St. Martin's is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by world leaders of the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The parish administration - the administrative body of the parish, composed of world leaders - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would seek to transfer costs" to the parish administration, although the parish administration was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some parishioners complained about the intransparency in the work of the diocese.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Shark injures 13-year-old during lobster hunt in California
>>srp_Cyrl<< The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving in search of lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in the town of Encinitas.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Chad Hamel stated to KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he overheard the boys' calls for help, and then he and the group rowed to him to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just the excitement of the lobster catch, but then “he realized he was yelling ‘She bit me!
She bit me.”
Members of the assembly of all political parties worry that they may become a laughingstock.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘The shark is in the water!’”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is not known what type of shark attacked him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rescue supervisor Larry Giles said in a press release that a few weeks before that the shark had already been spotted in the area, but that it had been found not to belong to a dangerous species.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper part of the hull.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to the Swami's area in the city of Encinitas for 48 hours due to the investigation and security.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sainsbury's trading chain plans to enter the UK beauty market
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sainsbury's becomes a competition for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores with departmental cosmetic products in the style of department stores where expert assistants work.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As part of a significant penetration into the UK cosmetic products market which is turning 2.8 billion pounds, with that figure rising as sales in fashion and home equipment markets decline, larger cosmetic products departments will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and will open in more stores next year if they prove to be successful.
Investment in cosmetic products comes from supermarkets finding ways to take advantage of shelf space after lawsuits for TVs, microwaves and home equipment.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Sainsbury's retail chain has announced that it will double the supply of cosmetic products to as many as 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also gain more space with areas for certain brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The supermarket also re-launches the Boutique Palette of Makeup to make most products suitable for vegans - as demand is on the rise when it comes to younger customers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Additionally, the Fragrance Shop perfume store will test outlets at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, a southern part of London, last week, and the second opens in the Selly Oak settlement, Birmingham, later this year.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Shopping online and switching to the daily supply of small amounts of food in local stores means supermarkets must make an extra effort to attract people to visit them.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mike Coop, executive director of the Sainsbury's trade chain, stated that the department's outlet would increasingly resemble self-services as the supermarket chain tries to strike back at sales facilities with large discounts to Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Sainsbury's retail chain has opened Argos outlet departments in hundreds of stores and numerous Habitats departments since it purchased both of these chains two years ago, which it says has increased sales of food products and the profitability of the acquisition.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The previous attempt by this supermarket to modernize the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments ended infamy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Sainsbury's retail chain tested a joint venture with Boots Store in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended after taking a win in the division of revenues from pharmaceutical stores in their supermarkets.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The new strategy takes effect after Sainsbury's sold a pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to the Celesio Company, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lloyds was said to have a role in this plan by presenting an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of our beauty department to provide our customers with a better environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at your service to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations make us an indispensable destination for cosmetic products that sets new standards for how to shop."
Peter Jones 'infuriated' after pulling Holly Willoughby out of 11-million-pound deal
Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, is “infuriated” after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11 million-dollar business with his personal brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Willoughby has no time for their brand of home and accessories Truly.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This couple's company collaborated with Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old announced her departure on Instagram this morning.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, star of Dragons Dan, by withdrawing at the last minute from a profitable business with their brand to focus on her own new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was “infuriated” when a TV screen favorite during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire’s headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that new offerings worth up to 1.5 million pounds no longer gave him enough time to devote to their home and accessories brand, Truly.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The company collaborated with Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and was predicted to double Willoughby's estimated fortunes of 11 million pounds.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When Willoughby, 37, announced via social network Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones went from Britain to one of his cottages.
According to the source, “Holly was putting the Truly brand at the very top of its priorities.
This was to be her long-term plan from which she would make money in the next few decades.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Her decision to withdraw stunned all involved.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch date.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The warehouse at the Marlow headquarters is stocked with merchandise ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning’s host, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, as well as possible further delays to the launch date.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Willoughby, who is the mother of three children and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 2016, Willoughby founded Truly with Capov, and in March they were joined by Jones, 52, as the company's CEO.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These couples spend the holidays together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV producer house.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for M&S and will replace Ent McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity TV channel ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business."
After the harsh words “compassion”
He was criticized by the media for comments that some say are "not worthy of a president" and for his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Why is President Trump retiring so much?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Trump said imitating the voice of a TV commentator.
“I’m not withdrawing from anything.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump praised their original June meeting in Singapore as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, negotiations on denuclearization have died down.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that there was no “appropriate reaction” from the United States to North Korea’s initial disarmament steps.
Instead, he stressed, the United States does not lift sanctions that exert continuous pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are making great progress with North Korea,” he said.
“We were one step away from a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We have a great relationship now."
He noted that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - missile tests have ended, hostages have been freed and the remaining U.S. soldiers have returned home.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He defended this unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be a decent president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia ravage island, leaving hundreds dead
>>srp_Cyrl<< After the Lombok Island earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok Island has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international help, so we are facing some difficulties,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pale, it’s still unclear if foreign personnel can work in the field.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Pal to determine whether international agencies will be allowed to participate in providing assistance.
Given the constant earthquakes that shake Indonesia, it is regrettable how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other shores.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The loss of life was also likely contributed to the apparent non-advertising of the tsunami warning siren in Palu even though the warning was in effect.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Travels between a number of Indonesian islands and otherwise pose a challenge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Natural disasters further hamper logistics.
A hospital ship stationed on the island of Lombok to assist earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new accident.
>>srp_Cyrl<< President Yoko Vidodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's aging infrastructure and did not save money for roads and railways.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the lack of financial resources hit Mr. Yoko's administration, and he is due to re-election the following year.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mr. Yoko also faces pressure creating long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim population have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
>>srp_Cyrl<< More than 1000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other cruel weapons.
Daniel Starridge, Liverpool player, scores an even point against Chelsea
>>srp_Cyrl<< Daniel Staridge saved Liverpool's Premier League defeat to Chelsea on Saturday by a shot in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Staridge received a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri on 27 metres from a Chelsea goal when his team was losing 1–0.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He first moved the ball to the left, then kicked to the farthest part of the net.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The ball went high above the goal in the right upper corner of the net.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She eventually flew over goalkeeper Kepa Arizabalaga who jumped to catch her and fell into the net.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I was just trying to set myself up and set up for the kick, and players like Shaqiri always play forward as much as possible, so I simply tried to pick myself up in as much time as possible," said Staridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching, I touched the ball once and it just kicked, without much thought.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Chelsea led 1–0 at half-time after a goal by Belgian star Eden Azar in the 25th minute.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Blue striker returned the ball to Mateo Kovačić on the heel, and then turned in the middle of the field and ran for half of Liverpool.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kovach exchanged a few short kicks in the middle of the field.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He then directed a brilliant centre-kick, leading Azar towards goal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Azar overtook the defense and directed the final kick with his left foot into the farthest part of the net alongside Alison Becker, a Liverpool player.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Liverpool play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Chelsea meet Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Tuesday at 3 pm in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia jumped to 832, according to a disaster management agency statement on Sunday morning.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Numerous applications have arrived for people trapped in the rubble of buildings hit in a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit Indonesia on Friday and triggered waves up to 6 meters high, a spokesman for the Sutopo Purvo Nugroho agency said at a press conference.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was buried by the remains of the collapsed buildings.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
>>srp_Cyrl<< The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Berkenhead, Merseyside County.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in the town of Grayson Music on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police called people in the area who had seen or heard anything to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would call everyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead and see or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a camera on the dashboard to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
>>srp_Cyrl<< A police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body was found lives in Berkenhead and was found on the property.
Today afternoon, friends who think they know this woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
>>srp_Cyrl<< An investigation is ongoing, and police have stated that they are currently notifying the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that everyone was banned from entering and exiting the building.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was left speechless when he found out what had happened.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Residents were told that their return would not be allowed until a few hours later.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Word got out that a police officer told one man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A woman in tears appeared at the scene.
She kept saying, “This is terrible.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< At 2 p.m. two police vans were in a cordon with another van outside.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Several police officers stood in the cordon monitoring the apartment blocks.
All those who have access to some information are invited to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and provide a record of 247 as of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in front of the parliament building becomes the subject of the latest debate on monuments over a contention about "falsifying history"
>>srp_Cyrl<< Its removal would be poetic justice for its destruction in the style of the Taliban of many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "insanity" and "an attempt to falsify history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “The figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace was an inevitable goal in the ongoing debate over the removal of the statues.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cromwell neither issued an order nor enforced iconocorism during the English Civil Wars.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed because of the work of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Turnicroft testifies to a 19th-century opinion and is part of the historiography of a figure who, according to many, still deserves to be glorified.
Mr. Goldsmith made the following statement to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, consider Cromwell to have defended Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, of monarchy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The credibility of this description has been the subject of constant debate throughout history.
>>srp_Cyrl<< What is certain is that this mid-17th century conflict shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is as an individual a recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His successes as a Lord Protector titleholder also deserve to be glorified and kept from oblivion."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Pig-killer caused fatal injuries to Chinese farmer
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to local media reports a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his last name "Juan", was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in a market in the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The owner of a pig farm is preparing to inject the pigs in Xinning in Qinghai province, China.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He reportedly came with a cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A relative found him dead the next morning and noticed that the door to the neighboring hog was open.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He said there was a large male pig in the hog that had blood on its mouth.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig caused fatal injuries to the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” said a relative referred to under the surname Wu, according to Guiyang Evening News.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A security camera video shows Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His body was found about an hour later.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The animal that killed the man belonged to neither Yuan nor his cousin.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so it wouldn't attack anyone again, while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although this rarely happens, there are already recorded cases of swine attacks on humans.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, causing a man critical injuries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig held a Welsh farmer pinned against a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a farmer from the province of Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood could be a trigger for them.
“They’re just playing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They like to nibble, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You just need to treat them with respect," he said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread downpours to the Southwest of the United States
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Rosa will bring showers in the coming days to the north of Maxique and the southwest of the United States that will lead to flooding.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rosa, with winds of 137 km/h, on Saturday from 5 a.m. eastern time, was a Category 1 hurricane and was located 620 kilometers southwest of the settlement of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to Ross's expectations, he will move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure field begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and heads east, heading for the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin pushing high tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity due to contact with the approaching low pressure field will lead to widespread showers in the southwest.
The amount of rain from 2.5 to 10 cm in local areas will cause dangerous torrential floods, the blowing up of rubble with water and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause precipitation of about 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is also expected to rain from 5 to 10 cm in certain parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are possible torrential flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the unrestrained nature of tropical rains.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It would be extremely thoughtless on foot to head into the desert as the threat of tropical rains looms.
Due to heavy rainfall, the canyons can turn into frantic rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to tumultuous winds and dust in the air.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A low pressure field approaching will bring locally heavy rain in certain parts of the southern California coast.
Rainfalls of more than 1.5 cm are possible, which can cause minor destruction of rubble with water and slippery pavements.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It will be the first rain in the region for their rainy season.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mestime tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, and Monday night and Tuesday rainfall will cover the wider area.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The showers will spread to the area of southwest part of Colorado, southeast part of Utah, northeast part of Arizona and northwest part of New Mexico on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In October, large fluctuations in temperature across the United States are possible as the Arctic cools, while in tropical regions, it will retain fairly warm weather.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This sometimes causes huge differences in temperature over small distances.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A great example is the dramatic temperature differences in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa, there is a difference in temperature of nearly 20 degrees.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The long-lasting summer heat will rise again and spread over the next few days.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the greater central and eastern part of the United States, a warm start of October is expected with a temperature of 27 degrees Celsius in much of the country, from the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The temperature in New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
>>srp_Cyrl<< More than 20 million people watched on six television channels on Thursday the exciting testimony of Supreme Court nominees, Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse that allegedly happened in the 1980s.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with television outlets terminating Friday's regular program scheme for last-minute reversals: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator, Jeff Flake according to which the FBI is to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh had felt her up and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kavanaugh, in touching testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people probably watched it Friday, according to a Nielsen report.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She has counted the average television ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The figures were not immediately available for other networks displaying it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of viewers in offices.
>>srp_Cyrl<< By comparison, that number of viewers can match the audience that follows the football playoff game or the Academy Awards ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, with Opinion's hosts strongly supporting Kavanaugh's appointment, recorded the highest ratings of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing, according to Nielsen.
>>srp_Cyrl<< ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen news agency.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This process aroused great interest even after the hearing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Flake was the central personality of the drama that took place on Friday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After making a statement from the moderate Republican's office that they would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, cameras of CNN and CBS television filmed protesters yelling at him on Friday morning while he was trying to take the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He stood for a few minutes with a lowered view as they insulted him, which CNN carried live.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said to him, ‘You have power, and so many women are helpless.’”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he said he had more to bring up at the committee hearing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All cable and television outlets broadcast live events hours later when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to forward Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate in full.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Flake said he agreed to it only on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the nominee during the following week, which was persistently demanded by a minority of Democrats.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Flake was partially convinced of this by a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After talking to Coons and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Flake's choice had weight because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without investigation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “playing politics” in Brexit case
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is coming to the Conservative Party conference on 29 September 2018 in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Checkers plan for Brexit, calling the proposal for a single UK-EU customs zone “completely meaningless.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The murder of Wade Simms: Police arrested suspect Dytheon Simpson for the death of a University of Louisiana player
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police arrested the murder suspect with the gun of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old University of Louisiana basketball player.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed behind bars on charges of second-degree murder, the police administration in Baton Rouge said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Officials released video footage of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the brawl.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police found glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB channel attached to the CBS network reports.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After interrogating Simpson, police stated that he confessed to fatally wounding Wade with a gunshot.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was set bail at $350,000, a lawyer said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< On Friday, the office of the parish's pathologist in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report listing a gunshot wound through the head to the neck as the cause of death.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Credits for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest are credited by the department to the Louisiana State Police Task Force for apprehending fugitives, the state's crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and local residents.
The director of the University of Louisiana athletics department, Joe Alleva, thanked local law enforcement authorities for their “advocacy and pursuit of justice.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sims was 20 years old.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A two-foot-tall winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana University.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “stressed” and “in shock” by Wade’s death.
“It’s something we’re constantly worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano blasts ash into Mexico City
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ashes ejecting the Popocathepetl volcano reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from volcanoes due to increased activity in the crater and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This center has recorded more mild seismological activities.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In pictures by social networks, you could see thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in the municipalities of Mexico City, such as Hochimilco.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Geophysicists have observed increased activity in a volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
>>srp_Cyrl<< Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence supporters clashed with riot police, while thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Catalan secession vote that divided the population.
A group of masked separatists, who were restrained by riot police, egged them and threw powdered paint, so dark clouds of dust were created on the streets that usually teem with tourists.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Later in the day there was also a brawl that police officers restrained with pendrecs.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “No forgetting, no forgiveness” in the face of Unionist protestors shouting “Long live Spain.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fourteen people received help due to minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media reports.
Tensions are not waning in the independence region even a year after the October 1 referendum, which is celebrated by separatist Catalans, although Madrid has declared it illegal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was small since the crowd of people who were against secession boycotted the election.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region, leading to violent clashes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of national police forces.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Demonstrations were held, but the route had to change.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who came with his wife to protest the separatists said he had lost hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
>>srp_Cyrl<< My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we are in a hopeless situation," he said.
Despite achieving a key but narrow victory in the December regional elections, Catalan parties pushing for independence have had difficulty continuing in the same spirit this year as many of their best-known leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and declaring independence.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who telephoned the protest in support of the police, said the conflict was being fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is tense,” he said.
Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since the end of last year, has announced he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“To highlight the candidacy for the European elections is the best way to condemn the collapse of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after car slamming into house
>>srp_Cyrl<< Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonery.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This incident took place on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent Street around 7:30pm British summer time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Detective Inspector Bob Blemings stated that the entrance and the building itself were damaged.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is also possible that at some point a crossbow was fired at the house.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Menge's scoring brings Livingstone's win over Rangers by 1-0
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dolly Menga secured the victory with the first goal for Livingston
>>srp_Cyrl<< Livingston upon moving to the senior league surprised Rangers by forcing Stephen Gerard to concede only the second defeat in 18 games as club manager from Ibrox Stadium.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dolly Manga brought changes with his goal since Gary Holt's team tied with Hibernian in second place.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Gerard's team is left without a win in the Premier League this season, and is meeting leaders on the Harts table next week, who are eight points behind.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Prior to that, Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Meanwhile, Livingston extended the streak without defeat in the division to six games, with head coach Holt not yet experiencing a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Livingston missed chances against uninspired guests
>>srp_Cyrl<< Holt's team was to lead long before the hit he scored, since the offensive game was making Rangers trouble at all levels.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scott Robinson broke through, but carried the ball in front of the goal, to be kicked by the net by Alan Lithgow after slipping to take a headbutt by Craig Halket in front of the goal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The hosts were happy to let Rangers players play in front of them, knowing that they could give difficulty to the visiting team with the playable actions.
In this way, they scored a key goal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers made the offense, and Livingston opened the game after performing a free kick by having Declan Gallagher and Robinson combine to hire Meng who passed the ball into goal from the middle of the sixteen.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the previous part of the game, Rangers dominated ball possession, but could not break through the host's defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems,
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the same style, it continued into the second half, although Kelly had to defend one shot by Alfred Morelos.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Alan McGregor, Rangers goaltender, deflected Scott Pittman's attack and Litgou kicked past goal in Livingston's second game action.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Livingston defended several centre-kicks, and two penalty requests were also denied - after Halkett's objection to substitute Glenn Middleton and one for playing with his hand.
"The Awesome Game" by Livingstone - analysis
>>srp_Cyrl<< Alasder Lamont from BBC Scotland Television at Tony Macaroni Stadium
>>srp_Cyrl<< A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All players, without exception, were outstanding and again exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since returning to the front lines, they haven't almost changed the style of the game and people, but one should give great credit to Holt for the way he has brought vivacity to the team since his arrival.
There were so many heroes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Captain Halket was unsurpassed in leading a top organized defense, while Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warall on standby the whole time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Rangers was not inspired.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As good as he used to be under Gerard, he fell well below that level.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They couldn't score - they only broke through the host's defenses once - and it's a sort of alarm bell for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Erdogan encountered a mixed reception in Cologne
The meeting between the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29th) during breakfast in Berlin was accompanied by mixed reactions.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They differed on issues involving human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest proportion of the Turkish population outside of Turkey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police blocked a gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque citing security reasons, but many supporters found themselves nearby to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The conflicting protests reflect a split in opinion about a visitor some Turks in Germany are plotting as a hero, while others accuse him of being an autocrat.
Road accident in Depford: Biker killed in car crash
>>srp_Cyrl<< In a collision with a car in London, a cyclist was killed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at around 10:15 a.m. British summer time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The driver of the car stopped and paramedics showed him help, but the man died on the spot.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A few months before this collision, another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, about a mile from the collision that occurred on Saturday, which the driver struck and escaped.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The roads are closed and bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
>>srp_Cyrl<< Six prison police officers were injured in the unrest in a men's prison with a high degree of security, the prison facility said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The riots still ongoing occurred at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09:30 British summer time.
A team of Tornado specialists was brought in to deal with the unrest that was reduced to one wing and involving eight prisoners.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Officers were shown assistance at the scene due to minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison officers were brought in for the ongoing incident at Her Majesty’s Long Lartin Prison.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Six staff members received assistance due to injuries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear our position that responsible persons will be reported to the police, which is why they could stay behind bars longer."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the state.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In June, it was announced that the warden of the prison was undergoing hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In October last year, the intervention police were called to prison for serious riots in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened by Hurricane Rosa with torrential flooding (which may well come to areas affected by drought)
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tropical depression rarely affects Arizona, but it is likely to occur early next week since Hurricane Rosa is moving across the desert to the southwest, carrying with it the risks of torrential flooding.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rosa is expected to reach Phoenix directly on Tuesday, and her approach will be announced by rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status at 200 miles [320 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hurricane Katrina (1967) hit a region 64 kilometers away from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 5 to 10 cm, with amounts of up to 15 cm in isolated places, such as the Mogolon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the desert to the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5-5 cm, with possible totals in isolated places up to 10 cm.
For areas where there is no fear of torrential flooding, the rain that Rosa will bring can be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although floods are a very serious cause for concern, rain will be welcome in some parts because there is currently drought in the southwest.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the U.S. drought surveillance agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona is affected at the very least by extreme drought, a category of second order," Weather.com reports.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hurricane Rosa's trajectory first leads to landslides in the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, who still had hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum gusts of 135 kilometers per hour, is currently 620 kilometers south of the resort of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and heading north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it lost in force.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That is why landslides in Mexico are expected to occur when the storm reaches the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is possible that brings a significant risk of flooding.
“A total rainfall of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Lower California to the northwestern part of Sonora State, with a possible rainfall of as much as 10 cm,” Weather.com reports.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rosa will then move northward through Mexico as a tropical storm, to reach the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move upwards through Arizona and arrive in southern Utah late into the night on Tuesday.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rain in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the American desert in the southwest,” the National Hurricane Monitoring Center said in a statement.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This rain is expected to lead to torrential, life-threatening floods and the blowing up of rubble in deserts and landslides on hilly terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
>>srp_Cyrl<< After a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
>>srp_Cyrl<< An injured teenager was found on Excelsior Terrace Street in the town of Midsomer Norton, Saturday at around 04:00 British summer time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was transported to the hospital and is in stable condition.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the night, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the area of the city of Radstock, according to the Avon and Somerset Police Service.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police have asked anyone who possibly has footage of this event on their mobile phones to contact her.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the spite and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a speech in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the spite and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kavanaugh, in vigorous and emotional testimony Thursday before Congress, denied claims by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At this hearing, Ford also testified to her claims.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw all the ingenuity, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A positive vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class biography in public service,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The president briefly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination during a speech on the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
“Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although I'm not running personally, I'm actually running," he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump concluded that Democrats are on a mission to “resist and hinder.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected on Friday at the latest, according to a statement by the senior assistant to the GOP leadership for CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have left hundreds dead, and that number continues to rise.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At least 384 people have died, with many being swept away by giant waves crashing onto beaches when the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a major earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on Friday for a beach festival when waves six meters high hit the coast at dawn, taking many to their deaths and destroying everything that got in their way.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach, instead of running away immediately and therefore becoming victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told media in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come on its own, it dragged cars, trees, houses and hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and thus survived, he stated.
>>srp_Cyrl<< About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palu.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Air photos released by the disaster mitigation agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges distorted and demolished, and a mosque surrounded by water.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The accompanying quakes struck the coastal city again on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, a series of earthquakes were felt.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy of Friday's devastating earthquake was about 200 times that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is possible that the geographical characteristics of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, contributed to the development of a higher tsunami strength," he stated.
Nugroho said the damage was "huge" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Nugroho stated that greater losses and damage along the coast are possible 300 km north of the city of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications “were completely cut off and there was no information” from Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” the statement said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< On Saturday, the agency received criticism from various sides that it had not issued a notification that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In an amateur video shared over social networks, a man on the top floor of the building is heard shouting from the heel vessels, warning people on the street on a tsunami approaching.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Within minutes a wall of water hit the shore, taking buildings and cars away.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Reuters could not immediately confirm the credibility of the video.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused communications to cease around Palu, making it difficult for the competent authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
Authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still needed food and other basic supplies.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The city's airport is only reopened for assistance arriving and will remain closed until October.
>>srp_Cyrl<< President Yoko Vidodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The balance of victims of the Indonesian tsunami impact exceeded 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
The staff of the World Vision humanitarian organization arrived safely from Dongale to the city of Palu, where employees hide in shelters made of waterproof canvas placed in the courtyard of the office and on their way to the city were greeted by scenes of destruction and devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is extremely bad.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Even when relief groups began taking the first steps in mitigating the disaster, there were complaints that foreign humanitarian workers with deep expertise were not allowed to travel to Pale.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of overseas assets, supplies and people is only possible if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That hasn't happened yet.
“It continues to be characterized as a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When state institutions declare a national disaster, we can provide international assistance, but so far there is no such status.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< When the second night fell on Pale after the earthquake and tsunami that befell it on Friday, friends and family of the missing still harbored the hope that their loved ones would miraculously escape the sad fates of victims of natural disasters.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The little boy was pulled out of the sewers on Saturday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rescuers released a woman under the rubble on Sunday who had been trapped next to her mother's body for two days.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The others trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mr. Gendon told how, hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse reached the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to contestants in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, his messages carried only one gray mark, instead of two blues.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
The thieves took $26,750 during a cash machine charge at Newport on the Levee.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's company employee who was filling an ATM at the Newport on the Levee facility on Friday morning, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at an entertainment complex and preparing to put in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “ran behind the back of a Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money he was supposed to put into an ATM.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All who dispose of information about their identities are urged to contact Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to "Ye"
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing this change on Saturday on Twitter, he wrote: “It will once be known as Kanye West.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, so he used it to name his eighth album, which came out in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, which is expected to announce the new album "Yandhi".
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was invited to the show instead of singer Ariana Grande who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's author said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Apart from representing the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that this word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible and means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with a radio host named Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m all of us, that’s us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< From the name Kanye, meaning ‘the only one', I have moved on to just ‘Ye' (you) - which is the personification of everything good, bad, and unclear in us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This album is, essentially, a reflection of who we are."
>>srp_Cyrl<< He is only one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, who is known by the nicknames Puff Daddy, Pi Didi or Didi, this year pointed out that he would like to be referred to as "Love" (Love) and "Brother Love" (Brother Love).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Formerly West's associate, J.J.-Z., used the nickname with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador made a promise at Tlatelolk Square that he would “never use the military to carry out repression against the Mexican people.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< On October 2, 1968, troops fired on peaceful protesters gathered in the square and killed as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were based in Latin America.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lopes Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving financial aid each month to those studying and would open more free state universities.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He said unemployment and the inability to acquire education are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Needs to Double Funds for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the development of artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount it spends on research in this area, says investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These comments came after various foreign governments of the United States announced the development of artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy for doing so.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be No. 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“To begin with, it would be good to double the budget for AI research, since all other countries are so behind schedule for the U.S., and we are striving for new progress in this domain,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, works as CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face+.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest ranked American Othello player, and was later the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's branch in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotic Challenge of the U.S. Department of Defense Agency responsible for developing new technologies (DARPA) and asked when the next one would take place, to help identify the next visionaries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not the academic leaders going to China, it’s the big corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have employed prominent minds from universities to work on the development of artificial intelligence.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lee points out that changes in immigration policy could help the United States strengthen its aspirations in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In July 2017, the Chinese State Council outlined a plan to develop the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
China's National Foundation for Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work being lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which will include partners from this sector and academia, while the White House announced the formation of a select artificial intelligence committee.
In addition, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called “Artificial Intelligence of the New Generation”.
>>srp_Cyrl<< On the other hand, the National Science Foundation of the United States (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the establishment of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been active for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", ending a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their bids for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring northern state represents the claim of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would jeopardise the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the turnout would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question on the ballot reads: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying in exchange for membership in alliances such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievski, 79, in Skopje.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said they will comply with the result of the vote to make it decisive.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been reported by 1pm.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters went to the polls.
"I went out to vote for my children because we belong in Europe," said Djosche Tanevski, 62, a voter in the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia with his wife Zorica and son Duska in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country that is supposed to open the country's path to membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and places chairs in front of the tent set up by opponents of the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the upright heads, not through the service entrance," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be ‘for’ because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after the vote.
He added that the result "for" would be a "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will vote in the referendum, below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Thelma, concluded that 57 per cent of voters would vote in the referendum.
Of these, 70 percent voted yes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For a referendum to succeed, half of the enrolled voters plus one need to go to the vote.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Failure in the referendum would have dealt the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western government since taking power in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes the entire defence of Brighton and scores a goal
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defence of a 2–0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It seemed too easy when Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield from where he started the attack.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He ran between three Brighton defensive players, then mowed everyone down in an open field row.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Then Aguera was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He outscored one defensive player, then outscored several others on the edge of a Brighton goal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He then kicked the ball to the left, finding Sterling.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The English winger immediately returned the ball to Aguer, who overcame Brighton goaltender Matthew Ryan by kicking into the right side of the net with his right leg.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pepper Guardiola, Manchester City’s manager, told reporters.
“We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's the way it was.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We were lucky to have scored a goal at that point."
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the initial advantage to the SkyBlues in the Premier League encounter was brought by Sterling.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He scored in the 29th minute.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Aguero took the ball deep in Brighton territory in that action.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He directed a beautiful pass to Leroy Seine on the left flank.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Shane had several contacts with the ball before hiring Sterling on the second stint.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The SkyBlues' attacker threw the ball into the net, then immediately then slid off the field limits.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Manchester City meet Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 pm in a Champions League group match at the Rhine-Nekar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scherzer wants to play a game against Rocky with no competitive significance to the Nashnals
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since Nashnals was eliminated from the playoff competition, there was not much reason to insist on another game.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the competitive Scherzer hopes to take the position on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have one game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers, are still in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured themselves a wild card victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to win their first division title.
“While we can’t get anything, at least we can get out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team is likely to be at the highest level against any point I would play this year.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Why wouldn't I participate in such a competition?"
>>srp_Cyrl<< Nashnals has not yet announced a starter for the week, but they are reportedly considering letting Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scherzer, to whom this would be the 34th time he would open the game, held a training session on Thursday and will pitch on Sunday when he normally rests.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A right-handed Washington player leads 18-7 this season with a 2.53 and 300 strikeout average earned in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
>>srp_Cyrl<< The president briefly referred to the situation in which his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Cavanaugh, is located during a speech on the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
"Everything we have achieved will be put on the line in November.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“This is one of the biggest, even though I’m not running personally, I’m actually running and that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continues: “Look at this terrible radical group of Democrats, look what’s happening now.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They are determined to regain power by not choosing the means, you see spite, dirty games.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and hinder.”
“You could have seen it in the past four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, spiteful, heinous and dishonest.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< He mentioned Democratic Senator and Justice Committee member Diane Feinstein by name, which caused a loud public outcry.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, what.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No, no, I'm waiting for him -- it was very bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
There is no tolerance for those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for my censorship, it almost didn’t surprise me.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I am only the last in a series of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party to be told they are not welcome - just because we have expressed our opinions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< My colleague from Parliament, Joan River, went similarly because she resolutely opposed antisemitism.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In my case, the censorship initiative followed criticism for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe - the irony is that these are similar topics that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting at the Labour Party in East Nottingham on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Of the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament from the Labour Party, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday nights have generally been just like that.
Unfortunately, meetings are rarely held in this spirit today, and the promise of a “nobler, more moderate” policy has long been forgotten, if ever there were any such aspirations.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is assessed according to whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared similar political views began expecting me to change them from the ground up and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with - whether it was national security or a single EU market.
Every public address I make, regardless of what I say, is accompanied by a tirade of abuse on social media, calling for the annulment of my election, condemning the politics of the centre, saying that I have no place in the Labour Party.
I’m not the only one with that experience.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I am aware of having more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis without ever being distracted by it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that various types of abuse have become normal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The real truth is that we no longer accept different views and with each vote of no confidence or change of election rules, the party becomes increasingly stale.
Over the past two years, I have often been advised, urging me to lower my head, to keep my opinion to myself and then I would “be fit.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< But it goes against my political aims.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago from the school bench, caused by Margaret Thatcher's government's negligence that allowed my school classroom to literally collapse, I have sought to fight for providing better public services to those in need most - whether as a local councillor or minister in government.
I never hid my political affiliations, not even in the last election.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political beliefs and topics around which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this initiative on Friday, I would only say that, in the moments when our country is heading for a Brexit that will endanger households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Yet my only message is not intended for the Momentum organization of Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of nullifying my election or political shenanigans will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
>>srp_Cyrl<< The two late essays may have somewhat distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr won a deserved victory in this exciting game of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They are now at the top of the table, being the only undefeated side out of a total of ten.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the end, the home team took the upper hand thanks to superior defense, as well as a greater number of used chances and coach Peter Murchi had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested at the games so far and we haven’t yet suffered a defeat, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “All the praise for Eyre, they took their chances better than we did.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Grant Anderson's 14th minute essay, turned by Frasier Climo, brought Ira an advantage, but a yellow card for Scotland's captain, Rory Hugh, who had been taken out by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take the numerical advantage and Jason Bagot grabbed the unconverted essay.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Klimo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, at half-time, he scored and converted a solo essay to make Ayr score 17-5 on the break.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, turned by Bagot, reduced the backlog to five points.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There was then a lengthy setback due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was brought out on a stretcher, and Ayr further increased the lead with an essay by Stafford McDowell, who was turned by Klimo.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Then Ayr's deputy captain, Blair McPherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of the players again more by Bruce Colvin failing to convert the essay, after a short fierce pressure.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the host side returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for wrestling with Klima without the ball, from the penalty line, McPherson typed a touchdown behind Moll Ayr in the attack.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Klimo converted the essay, which he did again almost immediately in the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's punch and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth essay of the home side.
‘Still Game’ star gearing up for new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan is preparing to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been named CEO of a company that holds licensed restaurants.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The 56-year-old interprets the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, in which he is a screenwriter and stars along with long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last season of the show's broadcast and Kiernan seems to be making plans for life after Craiglang.
>>srp_Cyrl<< By official record he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the news, although a source at the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested that Kiernan wanted to become involved in the “successful restaurant sector” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has been stripped of access to the sea, hopes that the court will allow it back into the Pacific
>>srp_Cyrl<< The sailors patrol at the naval headquarters in La Paz.
>>srp_Cyrl<< On public facilities, the ocean-colored flag is flown.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: “We have full right to the sea.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We are obliged to return it."
>>srp_Cyrl<< In Bolivia, which has been stripped of access to the sea, the memory of the loss of shoreline still lives on in the bloody conflict over resources with Chile in the 19th century, and with it the longing for another voyage of the Pacific Ocean.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These hopes are perhaps the greatest in recent decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“The Bolivian current development of the situation is on hand, it is ruled by a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects an outcome in a positive spirit,” said Roberto Calsadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate giving a sovereign exit to the sea to Bolivia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For Eva Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia of indigenous origin - who is expected to have a controversial re-election fight next year - the verdict to be reached on Monday also carries a lot of risks.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia - and that little would change even if it did.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling is pronounced just six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
>>srp_Cyrl<< And not only has the case of Bolivia not progressed, but the previous four years may have set it back.
"The question of access to the sea has been seized for itself by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Morales' bellicose rhetoric killed off any affection for Chile, she pointed out.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Former President Edwardo Rodrigues Velce, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagreed with the claim that the court had unusually quickly made a decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Kalsadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the issue of the sea as a political backdrop.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“This judgment is an opportunity to see the necessity of overcoming the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it doesn't have confidence in US
>>srp_Cyrl<< North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never abolish the nuclear weapons program if he does not have confidence in Washington.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ri delivered a speech before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during the Singapore summit in talks between the conflicting leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be about to restart the deadlocked diplomatic nuclear arms talks more than three months after meeting North Korean Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says it is only a dream that continued sanctions and opposition to the U.S. declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not ready to accept the declaration until Pyongyang makes significant steps in the disarmament process.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, there is an all-out skepticism when it comes to Pyongyang's seriousness in terms of giving up its nuclear arsenal that his country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
On the Paris fashion shows are presented the latest lines of bulky headcovering accessories that you will soon see on the nearby main street
If you want to enrich your hat collection with bulkier models or block the sun completely, the search is over.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented on the runway a series of wacky huge head accessories from their Spring/Summer 2019 collection that overshadowed everything at Paris Fashion Week.
Incredibly impractical hats set fire to Instagram this summer, and these designers showcased their impressive creations on the catwalk.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Among Valentine's pieces, the over-emphasized beige hat decorated with a broad feather-like rim that swallowed the heads of the model with its size.
Other bulky accessories include jewelry-decorated watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a collection of bizarre masks at the right time for Halloween.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many colorful masks had sewn lips and were more suited to Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One creation resembled scuba gear complete with a snorkel and a mask, while the other looked like melted ice cream in a cone.
And if you build on the trend of attracting attention to bulky fashion details - you're in luck.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Those following trends predict that huge hats could soon be worn on nearby main streets.
The bulky hats follow the appearance of the popular straw hat "La Bomba" with a two-meter-wide rim that has been walked by many celebrities - from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cult etiquette on this impractical hat, which flooded social networks, stood behind another large creation featured on the runway - straw beach bags almost the same size as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
In the Jacquesmouse collection “La Riviera” for spring/summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week, the most prominent was the bag made of orange-colored raffia, edged with raffia and with a white leather handle at the top.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to hit the main street next summer, and since the designer has made such a boom, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for bulky accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of language is crucial for global citizens
>>srp_Cyrl<< Independent schools in Scotland can boast outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding test scores, which was further strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
>>srp_Cyrl<< With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the best level of service for students and parents.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and higher education, a chosen career and a place in society as global citizens.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As an education sector that can design and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject of choice for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it will get into their head.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you talk in his native language, it will reach his heart."
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Based on the recent results of this year's tests, we see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63% of those who learn Spanish also received an A grade.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland value foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Languages are now, as a subject of choice, given the same importance as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
In a 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills, 17 percent of employers cited as basic problems in filling vacancies as being attributable to language ignorance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That is why language skills are being given more and more importance in order to prepare young people for future careers.
Given the multiple potential business opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future because they possess a skill like this for life.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a person who speaks multiple languages above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov poll involving more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent said they did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of respondents, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Knowledge of multiple languages, especially those spoken in developing countries, will give children a greater chance of finding significant employment.
Each school in Scotland will be taught different languages.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are thought to be most important for the United Kingdom viewed in advance in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Whatever your child's interest, more languages will always be available in independent schools to choose from, with teaching staff who are proficient in the area.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever awaits them in the future.
It cannot be denied that today, in a global business environment, languages are still crucial to the future of the country, so they must also have a place in education.
Modern languages, in fact, should be considered the “skills of international communication”.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Independent schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice, diversity and outstanding achievements.
>>srp_Latn<< Il faut bien le faire.

>>srp_Cyrl<< LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
>>srp_Cyrl<< It's nearing the end of the wait for fans who want to see Lebron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in a Sunday pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But his exact minutiae have yet to be determined.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted a tweet that James was likely to have limited minutes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game Lakers preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Time to hold Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
>>srp_Cyrl<< President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallies tonight within the pre-election campaign in Willing, West Virginia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is the first of five planned Trump rallies for the next week, with tenure in friendly venues, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate’s confirmation of a vacancy in the Supreme Court postponed, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when a vote is cast in November.
What time is Trump going to hold a rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, which have become tense over allegations of sexual harassment, with an expected vote to confirm admission to the Senate delayed by a week until the FBI completes the investigation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, this series of rallies is held primarily to help Republicans gain support in the face of the November election.
As part of President Trump’s campaign, the five rallies are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“The importance of Congressional control is so great for his work that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of the crammed election campaign season,” a spokesman for the Trump campaign told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, with media coverage from Pittsburgh,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia, the state where he won the 2016 election with more than 40 percent of points, will be his second on Saturday in the last month.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come to try to raise him in the polls,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows determination in fight to stay in game to meet single matches on Sunday
>>srp_Cyrl<< After three one-sided sessions, the pair's Saturday afternoon tournament is perhaps just what Ryder Cup needs.
Although momentum variability is a fictional sports concept, players really believe in it, and especially in competitions of this type.
So, whose side would you say it is now?
“They had a six-point lead and now four, so you can say the momentum is on our side,” Jordan Spitt said as he left.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Europe, of course, is ahead of us with four points advantage and twelve more in the game.
Although Americans, in Spite’s words, get a little wind in their backs and have a lot on their side, especially the form of Spite and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each has three points out of four.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Spitt was a killjoy from the first to the last kick and gave everyone a homework assignment.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Exclamations of delight grew louder during his round, to eventually play a key final kick and get a fourth match with the same score when he and Thomas fell behind by two after two.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His final kick with which they won the match with 15 holes was greeted with a similar scream, which reflects the faith that the American team is not falling out.
“Basically, we just have to do our best and worry about our own match,” Spitt said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That's all these players can do now.
>>srp_Cyrl<< 18 holes to leave a stamp.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are no doubt a Ryder Cup story.
>>srp_Cyrl<< An unusual and at the same time charming European pair have won all four matches and play without error.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who did not play the bogey punches on Saturday afternoon, but they were also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the second half of Friday morning.
The game they have shown so far and the way they exchange energy with a noisy audience solidified them in the position of main favorites on Sunday and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take a potential European victory in the sunset over the grounds of the club “Le Golf National”.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European celebration.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Beetle Watson and Webb Simpson quickly overcame Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The bogies and double bogies in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they never even managed to spring.
Although, on Sundays, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
The four-ball game and the doubles tournament are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the tips they give and which they don’t give and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has a great lead before the final day, but this session of the doubles tournament has also shown that the US team has a desire to fight which some have suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe lead by 10-6 ahead of final day in Ryder Cup
>>srp_Cyrl<< Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, having achieved a 10-6 advantage over the United States after Saturday's matches in a four-ball game and in a doubles tournament.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, were the first to lead with two victories over the distraught Tiger Woods, increasing the score so far on the grounds of the Le Golf National club to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, which struggled to regain the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the imprecise American side in a four-ball morning game and won the series 3-1.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The United States put up more resistance in the doubles tournament, winning two matches, but could not reduce the backlog.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Jim Furick's side must win eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after a fantastic weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four matches.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After running over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then combined brilliantly and overcame pumped Woods and American debutant Bryson Deschamps with an even more convincing 5-4.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Woods, who had slipped through two matches on Saturday, shone for moments, but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in a four-ball game and in a doubles tournament and seven in a row.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Justin Rose, who had rested during the four-ball morning game, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the pair's tournament and suffered a 2–1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka - first and third in the world rankings.
But not everything went according to plan on this pleasant, clear day southwest of Paris.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Triple Majors tournament winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They won a 2-1 victory over John Ram and Jan Pulter in a four-ball game, to come back later and beat Pulter and Rory McElroy 4-3 in the doubles tournament, after losing the first two holes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Only twice in Ryder Cup history has some team returned after a four-point delay before single matches, although Furik's side, which defends the title, is enough of a draw to keep the trophy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, after already being in second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday would appear to be above their capabilities.
North Korea says 'no talk' of unilateral disarmament if no confidence
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations that the extension of sanctions deepens its distrust of the United States and that in such circumstances, the country will by no means unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the annual U.N. General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea has taken “significant measures over the past year to show good will,” such as cutting off nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and promising not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, there is no corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no question that we will be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization that would have rewarded North Korea for its gradual steps, his statement was of importance because he did not phase out unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current U.S. president and North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work to “denuclearize the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Washington has also ignored calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States does not give up on ‘denuclearization first and foremost’ and increases the level of pressure from sanctions to achieve its goal by force, opposing even the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The fact that they think sanctions can bring us to our knees is just the dreams of people who don’t know anything about us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But the problem is that extending sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader spoke about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If we were to negotiate this denuclearization issue with South Korea, not with the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not come at such a dead end.”
Despite this, the tone of Rio’s speech differed drastically from last year’s, when he told the U.S. General Assembly that targeting North Korea with missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket player” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much more needs to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Trump said on Wednesday that he did not set a time frame for this, saying, "If it should take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
>>srp_Cyrl<< China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Security Council sanctions must continue to be strictly and without relenting until there is complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously supported North Korea’s sanctions since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, so that North Korea would condemn him after only a few hours for making "gangster demands".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile range, as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim told him they were “appropriate measures” seeking security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on How to Get Enough Sleep
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to force students to get more sleep in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho culture of learning “all night long with the help of caffeine.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< One academic noted that university students are the number one in the world often ignorant in terms of basic self-care.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has devised a course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He got the idea of this course after a speech he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing this now, in my last year of study?’
>>srp_Cyrl<< She said no one had ever told her how important the dream was - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
In this course, which is held for the first time this year, students are presented with the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sporting outcomes, as well as improving their general well-being.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at this university, says that the university has decided to introduce this course after it was observed that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The one-hour course covers a range of interactive tasks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In one section is a picture of a room in a student dormitory and students need to click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of sleep routines.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the second part, participants listen to how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But we believe they have the right to know that - just as everyone has the right to know what the consequences of smoking cigarettes are to health," added Professor Chaisler.
A culture of pride about “not sleeping all night” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students has led to sleep deprivation becoming a growing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and of good quality, should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even against excess weight, since due to lack of sleep the brain goes into starvation mode, and therefore they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Chaisler design the course, after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He says this course opened his eyes and encouraged him to advocate for its maintenance at the campus-wide level.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The next step, as he hopes, would be to ask all postgraduates to undergo a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended students to think about setting alarms in time for sleep and waking and to take care of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus lead to sleep problems.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeat Gerard's team
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers suffered another drop in guests when Dolly Menga kicked Stephen Gerard's skewed team into a 1–0 defeat to Livingston.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Ibrox Stadium team sought to take their first away win after the February 4–1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerard as manager only the second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the elusive leaders of the Ladbrokes Premier League, Harts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Menga kicked seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers' uninspired lineup never came close to a tie.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As Rangers now fall to sixth, Livingston climbs to third behind Hibernian only because of the difference in goals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers may face additional problems after line judge Calum Spence had to be shown help due to a head wound after being hit on the side by some object.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Gerard made eight changes to the team that outscored Ayr and placed in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Holt, on the other hand, opted for the same eleven Livingston players who took the Harts' point last week and would have been delighted with the way his well-trained team was pressuring opponents at every turn.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers may have dominated the property, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was a little short of scoring just two minutes after Meng's first pass into the empty space sent Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed a great chance and kicked past the goal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kegan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halket with a deep free kick, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow kicked past goal at the second putt.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers were able to take control, but their game in the last line gave off more hope than faith in themselves.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Lowles collided, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's request
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers made only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox Stadium goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, defended the headbutt of Lasana Koulibaly without major problems and tamed the shot directed by Ovie Eyaria.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the real power-to-power ratio in the course of the game, no one can dispute that he was deserving if for nothing else, then because of the effort he put in.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rangers again could not cope with the Jacobs' deep-seated action.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Slot Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Gerard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibali and that replacement almost immediately gave the result when the winger hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came running from his line to block him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, Livingston continued to get guests to play just as they pleased, with long balls by Lithgow and Halket.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Holt's team had a chance to increase their advantage in the last minutes, but McGregor held up well and defended the Jacobs offense, then sent the ball past the goal from the corner with Litgou's head.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Glenn Middleton, Rangers' replacement, at the end of the game was looking for another penalty when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson did not react again.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Geiger devised a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the mainstays of science, Geiger’s Counter also has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Coronado Bell, starring seemingly incredible cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, “What is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When you put on those headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “Look, it’s really being heard!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize damaged cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System to Recognize and Kill Depraved Cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells in conjunction with treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then “see” the protein that is common in many cancers and then re-inject them.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells, ovarian cancer has retreated for more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” the protein that occurs in many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has been well demonstrated in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kanye West joined the fierce attacks in defense of Trump, wearing a cap marked MAGA, after hosting an SNL show.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unrelated speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for political office in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost Town", that night with a hat with the slogan "Make America Great", he gave a fierce speech against the Democrats and again gave support to Trump.
“I’ve talked so many times to white people who would say to me, ‘How can you support Trump when he’s racist?’
>>srp_Cyrl<< If I worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The SNL broadcast a sketch with Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star made fun of Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's claims of sexual abuse.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted a recording of West's heated speech on social networks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is unclear whether Rock wanted to make fun of West with this announcement.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Besides, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of the cap he was wearing.
“They threatened me behind the scenes.
They told me, “Don’t go out with that hat.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< They threatened me!
>>srp_Cyrl<< And then they say I sank," he said, reports the Washington Examiner.
The news continued, “Do you want to see what it looks like?” adding that it would “put on Superman’s cape because it means you can’t boss me around. You want a better world?
Spread the love.”
The audience booed his remarks at least twice and appeared to be uncomfortable with the cast of SNL, Variety reported, while one of the attendees told the magazine: “The whole studio is sick.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< At the last minute, West replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
News confused many with his rendition of "I Love It", disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
The news was backed by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candice Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR NOT COMPANYING IN FRONT OF THE VIOLENTS.”
However, TV host Karen Hunter wrote in her tweet that West was simply "his and that's absolutely wonderful".
“But my choice is NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and extols with a loud voice an ideology that is bad for my community.
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he would now be "once known as Kanye West".
>>srp_Cyrl<< He is not the first performer to change his name - before him, it was Didi, also known as Puff Didi, Puffi and Pee Didi.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Leone and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to a performer formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after man stabbed in Belfast restaurant
>>srp_Cyrl<< A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The incident occurred on Ballyhackamore Street, police said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Public Prosecutor's Office will consider the aforementioned charges.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington has condemned the deadly macho culture.
Keith Harrington is known for his role as John Snow in HBO's Game of Thrones, a medieval fantasy full of violence.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the 31-year-old actor denounced the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that because of such on-screen roles, young men often feel like they have to be rude to gain respect.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that “something went wrong” and addressed the question of how to deal with the problem of the disastrous macho culture in the YaIo era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he had a “strong need” to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m rather troubled at the moment by the question: what did we do wrong with the representation of masculinity?” he said.
“What are we teaching men growing up about the problem we see now?”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Keith believes that television may have been partly responsible for the spread of the pernicious macho culture due to the portrayal of characters posing as male.
He added: “What is innate, and what is taught?
>>srp_Cyrl<< What is it they teach us on TV and in the streets that makes young men feel they have to fit into a certain mold of a man's behavior?
I think that’s actually one of the main issues of our time, how do we change that?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Because obviously something went wrong with the young man."
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the prequels or sequels to The Game of Thrones following its completion next summer, saying that he “ended up with battlefields and horses.”
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's play True West - a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thug.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his current wife, Rose, is the best thing that has ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“In this series, I met my current wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on,” he said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rose played Igrit, the love partner of Keith's character John Snow, in this fantasy series that is a carrier of Emmy recognition.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in patients
>>srp_Cyrl<< China has announced a jump in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS of 14%.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to health workers, more than 820,000 people were infected in the country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the vast majority of new cases, the virus was transmitted via sex, which was not the case before.
>>srp_Cyrl<< HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past as a result of virus-infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Transmitting HIV through sex is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Homosexuality has not been considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say that discrimination against LGBT people is very widespread.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Studies estimate that, due to conservative understandings in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men end up marrying women.
Transmission of the virus often occurs due to inappropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs in conjunction with a plan to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff leaked data on GOP senators, denouncing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters has denied allegations that one of her staff leaked personal information to three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages.
A Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and the ultra-right wing websites.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The published information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, of Utah.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate Commission hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Cavanaugh.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The disclosure occurred at some point after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Conservative locations such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the announcements was linked to Waters' office and published information about a member of her staff, Hill reported.
“This baseless claim is a completely false and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and inaccurate claims - is in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This baseless claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Waters' statement quickly sparked condemnation on the Internet, which was also made by former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial exudes anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It must not be impertinent.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He must not question the plaintiff's motives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He must be calm and serene."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of acting too furiously at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who ran to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
“Big deal if it’s true,” his tweet read.
Waters said her office had informed "the relevant competent institutions and judicial authorities of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are held accountable before the law for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Review of "Johnny English: Back in Action" - a lukewarm satirical spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for a subtext on Brexit in every new British-themed film, which can also be applied to this sequel to Johnny English's satirical action comedy franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with the sequel Johnny English: Born Again.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Will the ironic autosaurism about what kind of blatant garbage we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the grumpy, incompetent Johnny English with a face like rubber has been given a new opportunity to mess something up - with his name more than anything revealing that it is a general comic creation designed for territories whose cinema audience English is not their native language.
It is, of course, about a cunning secret agent who, despite bizarre claims to the highest glamour, carries a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mister Bean and a crumb of that guy who played only one note within the theme tune of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was also originally based on a traveler and mystery man in international frameworks that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In this latest sequel about Johnny English, there are also several scenes worth mentioning.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly rattled about his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather lukewarm and unusually superficial, especially considering that “serious” film brands, such as “007” and “Mission Impossible,” now regularly include comic elements.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Humor leaves the impression that it is intended for children rather than adults and, to me, Johnny English's wacky misadventures are not as inventive and elaborate to the tinge as Atkinson's silent film-style gags when he interpreted Bean.
It is now a very topical topic that the UK is in serious trouble.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the horror of the agents on duty - unfortunately, small roles for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and combative character, who is already experiencing a complete meltdown due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thomson masterfully played this character modeled after Theresa May, but the script is quite poor.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Advisors from the intelligence service inform her that all active spies have been compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
It’s the head and chin of Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fancy institution, but unofficially holds lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gags when English provides an academy for spying in the spirit of “School of Rock.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Inglish returns to Whitehall on urgent procedure for instructions and reunites with former patient, Assistant Bowe, who is re-interpreted by Ben Miller.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bow is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, in an interpretation of Vicky Pepperdine which is somewhat redundant.
>>srp_Cyrl<< And so the coiled and incompetent Batman and Robin are back in action in Her Majesty's Secret Service and meet the beautiful femme fatale Olga Kurilenko, Ophelia Buletova.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Waltha, played by Jake Lacey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Inglish and Bau begin their odyssey of comical adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a glittering French restaurant, make chaos by smuggling on Volta's luxury yacht and Inglish launches a real anarchy by trying to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house using headphones for virtual reality.
It’s obvious that a lot of effort was put into that last sequence, but no matter how cute and cheerful, the whole movie seemed to be made for children.
Pretty mediocre quality.
As with other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with some role for Rowan Atkinson that would justify his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is making a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is due to consider a radical plan to get the British to work four days a week -- and get paid for five.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The party reportedly wants company heads to transfer the time they save thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving them an extra day off.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Employees would thus enjoy a three-day weekend - but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "fit" into the party's economic agenda and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The move to a four-day work week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "It is expected that the end of the year will be announced by the review.
“The change will not happen overnight, but the fourth working week is the goal that is included in the approach to the partnership of management,” he said.
The Labour Party did not first accept such an idea, Zelena's party came out for a four-week work week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, such a pursuit is not currently shared by the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party’s spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s play and the party is not watching.”
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party's pre-determined conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell expressed a determination to recover power from "unlikely conductors" and "profiters" in public enterprises.
Shadow minister's plans to also encourage the current shareholders in the leading companies may not be able to obtain their entire share of the debt because it would be al-Labourist's share of the debt.
He's also confirmed that he's committed to bringing employees into the management boards of companies and the creation of Inclusive Property Funds, a path that would cost 10 percent of the amount of private equity.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking for "60 Minutes" if they can change their minds about investigating the FBI in the case of Kavanaugh.
The FBI's investigation into the prosecution's allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has served as its attorney for the week following the prosecution's conviction and the prosecution's conviction.
In the interview aired on Sunday, Scott Pelli asked John Kennedy's Republican Senators, Lindsey Graham, if the FBI would be able to get ahold of them.
Kennedy was more open than his Southern Colleague.
“I mean, sure,” Kennedy said.
“I said, going to the hearings, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when the charges came up, and I said, 'Did you do that?'
He was determined, determined, unmistakable."
However, it seems that Graham's voice is embedded in the stone.
“I have made my decision on Brett Cavanoo and it would not have been changed by the most explosive accusation,” he said.
"I don't know what happened to Dr. Ford, but this is what I do know: Brett has all decided to drop," Graham added, referring to Christine Blaze Ford.
"And no one she's mentioned can confirm that.
That's 36 years ago.
>>srp_Latn<< I wouldn't say anything new is going to happen."
What was the "Globalski gradjanin" festival and did it contribute to the reduction of the poor?
These Saturdays New York City will host a festival of the Global Citizen, an annual musical event featuring a long and impressive list of performers and nothing less than an impressive mission.
The seventh festival of the Global Citizen in 2030, and the big meagre meagre park Sentral Park will be visited by tens of thousands of people, and it's not the only thing they'd enjoy doing.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is the flagship of the Global Poverty Eradication Project.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the visitors of the concert had to do a series of tasks, i.e., "actions" such as volunteering, sending emails.
But how much success did the Global Citizen have, given the 12 years left to the cause?
Is the idea of encouraging a free concert or is it the right way to convince people to call for action, or is it just a matter of people's "clicking" when there's still a call in the matter?
The Organizators of the Global Citizen claim that since 2011 they have committed more than 19 million actions of their supporters directed towards achieving a range of different goals.
It is claimed that these actions have helped the world leaders in 2030 to push forward the goals and policies of over 37 billion dollars that would affect the lives of 2 million people.
In the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 goals and the most recent ones from its actions, for which 10 billion shares have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the collection of funds has been directly impacted by over 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key issues in the UK include the power to eat, to partner with investors and contractors in order to "improve children's growth in their full potential" in the UK.
"With the support of the UK government, the donors, the national governments and the citizens of the world, like you, the social injustice in the form of unencouragement, we are able to promote social injustice in the form of unencouragement.
The group has also announced that it is pursuing more than 5,000 actions that are Unitedly called upon to improve the safety of mothers and children, as well as the government's reputation for finesse.
One of the frequently asked questions on my site, which is "for what reason do you think we can end extreme poverty?"

US could use Navy to block Russian energy exports, says interior minister
Washington can "take a step forward" to lean on its Navy to make it impossible for Russian engineers to reach a specific market, including the Middle East, the minister said.
Zinky has indicated that Russia's involvement in Syria - where, in a timely manner, it is engaging in a call for legitimate government to investigate new energy markets.
“I think that because of their presence in the Middle East, the desire to produce the sale of their energy is exactly what they are doing in Eastern Europe and in the Southern part of Europe.
And according to this official, there are ways and means that can be prevented.
“The United States has the ability to, with the help of our Navy, to provide for the opening of the sea routes, and to, if needed, to block them, to make sure that they are safe.
Zinki addressed the attendees at the event in the organization of the Consumer Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "Voice of Consumer Engagement".
He further compared Washington's approaches in terms of Russia and Iran, arguing that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, exploitation and replacement of energy," he said, saying for Russia that he was "against the fact that we know only one thing."
These statements were made at the time of Trump's administration's attempt to increase exports of all natural gas to Europe by replacing it with Russia, which is the main source of oil.
For the sake of achieving this goal, officials from Trump's administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to let him go.
Moscow is in more of a hurry to double the capacity of the North Stream 2, a pipeline worth 11 billion dollars that needs to double the capacity of the North Stream 2.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's formidable defense of this project is simply fueled by economic malaise and a lack of competition.
“I believe that we need to have the opportunity to use the power to use it as a means of exerting pressure and that the consumers should have the power to have the power to choose it”
The U.S. position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to this project.
LEADING A GERMAN INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION, A GERMAN INDUSTRIAL FEDERATION (BDI), HAS CALLED US TO NOT MIX INTO THE ENERGY POLICY OF THE E.U. AND THE BIAL.
"I'm very concerned about the interference of the third countries in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kemf, president of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) Bank.
Elizabeth Warren will “think well” about the candidacy for the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts senator says
Senatorka from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think well" of running for the presidency after being elected on half of the mandate.
At a meeting with the city administration in Holjok, Massachusetts, Worren confirmed that she would be considering a run for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and take care of our non-functional government, and that includes the woman at the top,” she said, according to the Hill newspaper.
“On the 6th of November, I’ll think about running for president.”
Vorenov met with the city administration during the meeting, criticising President Donald Trump, saying that he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren's outspoken criticism of Trump and his running mate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that even in her own electoral district, most voters do not believe that in 2020 she would need to be elected.
Fifty percent of the "credential" voters in Massachusetts said that the Senate would not need to run for office, and according to the experts, they have completed the University.
A quarter of two percent supported that kind of candidacy.
Anketa showed her support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent backing for the presidential nomination and 48 percent voting against it.
The second sound name from the order of democrats mentioned in the connection with the potential candidate for 2020 includes former Vice President Joe Biden and the Senatar from the Republic of Serbia.
Biden said he'd make the official decision by January, passing the Associated Press.

Trak Peylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
IN MONDAY, HE WAS ALREADY ACCUSED AND ACCUSED OF AN INCIDENT WITH VIOLENCE IN THE FAMILY
"That cross that my son is passing, that cross that he's passing after the return, I can understand the other families that he's feeling"
Peylin's wife's husband's husband described her as "an example of a great problem that everyone ignores and says about their son and other people's interests."
He's been detained in the past in Wassily in Alaska, charged with domestic violence, and assaulted by a woman, obstructed by domestic violence, and assaulted by a woman.
18 federal states and the District of Columbia supported the re-examination of new asylum records
Eighty states and the Columbine district supported the proper examination of the recent US legislation that predicates the prosecution of asylum-seeking victims.
Representatives of 18 states and the Colombian district submitted a petition Friday in Washington via “friends of the court” as an expression of support for an asylum seeker who wants to slow down the deal, NBC News reported.
There's a lot of complaints against Mr. Grace in the lawsuit against Mr. Sessions, which is against the federal law, and the U.S. government's commitment to civil liberties hasn't been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his sons, members of the gang" abused her, but her officials from the US on June 20 refused her asylum application.
She's being held in Texas.
State attorneys who provide legal support to Grace have described El Salvadore, Honduras and Guatemala, the countries from which a large number of asylum-seekers have come to the United States.
The new SAD asylum proposal was annulled in 2014 by a decision that was made by the Committee on Immigration Requirements, and that was made by the immigrants without any proof that they were going to be able to do so.
The top lawyer in the Columbia district, Carl Reisin, said on Friday that he was "ignoring the decade-old state, federal and international law."
“The federal law requires all decisions on all asylum claims to be made on the basis of concret facts and the circumstances of the “friends” of the claimant, and so on.
Lawyers have continued to insist that a transcript denying immigration access to U.S.A., saying that they are more likely to appear to be "lost" to those eligible for the company and "lost" to the company.
Top defense attorney Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who are fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their home country for reasons of persecution or fear, to the basis of their existence, their religion, their nationality, their belongings.
The purpose of asylum was never to solve all the problems, and not even all the serious problems that people are facing all over the world.
The desperate attempts to save Palu continue, and the number of the dead doubles as the race continues to run for the lives of the survivors.
The survivors were faced with an increasingly dire situation.
“It’s very exciting,” says 35-year-old mother Rhys Kusum, as he soothes his son who is crying in the evacuation center in the desolate city of Palu.
“An ambulance every minute brings the bodies.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There's not enough clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up everything they could from the things they had been doing and trying to save their lives.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the earth's magnitude 7.5 were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Harrises, who suffered from spinal and shoulder injuries, were at the front of your hospital in Palu, where the patients were treated in the third place.
His eyes filled with tears recounting how he felt when he was shaking the ground violently, he was shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he had shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I've been hit by the rubble of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're all right."
Ambasador Sad accused China of "misappropriating propaganda"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided phrase in a dictionary in the US, highlighting the two-sided uses of trade between the US and China, Ambas Dz.
The President of the United States Donald Trump has changed the past Wednesday's paid addition to the China Daily in the Dimoyn Registre, the most-received list in the state of Iowa.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the polls in the U.S.A. meant what officials in the U.S. described to Reuters as a new phase in Washington's campaign.
Even though it's not normal for the government to publish commercials in order to promote the trade, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating the trade war in the city.
The goal of China's retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war was to target excerpts from countries such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, according to experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-time Governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged the American economy.
As Branstad wrote in a column in the weekly edition of Dimojn Registra, China “is now additionally announcing to the female audience the propaganda statements in our own free speech.”
“I am expanding my campaign, the Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and I’m announcing my payment to Dim. Dim.
"From the other side, on the newsstand, on the street in Beijing, you'll be able to follow little opposing voices, and you won't see any real response from the opposing opinions.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused an offer to publish" his article, but did not say which list it was.
Analysts are warning that the Republicans are alienating women voters from the polls by choosing half of the candidates, because of their behavior with Judge Kavanaugh.
Though many from the top of the Republican Party's Republican Party's support, and the defense's bid for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's case faces higher charges for sex.
The emotions associated with this situation are extremely strong, and for the majority of the citizens, they already know that they want to give him their voice.
That's the kind of thing that's impossible to pull," said Grant Richter, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, in an article published on the Hill.
Richard has expressed doubt that he will insist that Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) be investigated by the FBI at the last minute to calm down the offending voter.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget tomorrow, they won’t forget it in november,” said Carin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and lawyer.
On Friday morning, the protestors chanted, "New Year's Eve is coming!" as they marched through the corridor of the Senate, after the Republicans, who were in charge of the Rightful Decree.
“Democracy enthusiasm and motivation will achieve unheard of causes,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political activist.
“People say it’s already at a high level, it’s true.
But it can also grow further, especially among undecided female voters from the suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age.", which is often not voted, in spite of
Even prior to the hearing, for which Ford's attorney detailed allegations of sexual misconduct against a member of the Supreme Court,
"This has gotten into a big mess for the Republican Party," he said before the week for NBC News' Michael Steele, a former Republican chairman of the National Security Council.
“It’s not just about the vote, it’s about the vote, it’s about the vote, it’s about the vote, it’s about whether Kavanaugh will end up in court.
However, it seems that the Americans have been divided on the issue of what they believe to be after the Fordova and Kavanaugh testimonies, with some more of the ones that are on the side of the road.
The new survey, which was conducted by J.G.'s agency, shows that 41 percent of the respondents are either definitively or likely to believe the Ford's testimony, while 35 percent of the respondents are definitively or likely to believe it was the Ford's.
Along with that, 38 percent of them said they thought Kavanaugh was lying or definitely lying in his face, while only 30 percent of them thought he was for Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating charges brought by Fordova, as well as by another person, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford's office had passed weeks ago, and she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that it was a matter of time before Mr. Kavanaugh's alcoholic stand was struck when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for a member of the Supreme Court showed her his genius for the time of the party they attended at Yale in the 1980s.
The invention of the World Wide Web is planning to reverse the new Internet in order to counter Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup project aimed at putting Rival Facebook, Amazon and Google together.
The latest development in this technology, "Inrupt", is a company built on the Berners-Lea's open-source platform at Sollid.
Solid users will be able to choose where their data will be stored and who will be able to access what information.
In the exclusive interview for Fast Company magazine, Berners-Lee found that the intent behind the Inrupt project was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said.
“This is an historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “personal storage space,” or POD.
It can contain lists of contacts, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser at a time.
What's unique about the personal storage space is that it's exclusive to the user who can access what information.
The company calls it “personally-reviving cross-data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to General Director John Bruce, is that the company provides the resources, the process, and the ability to do everything it can to help Solly.
The company is currently consisting of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security contractors from the A.B.E.A., a few permanent contractors who have been hired to work for several years.
Starting from this week, a wide-ranging agenda can create my own decentralized application to help the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not doing the "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change that will make all of them go away.
“We’re not asking for permission from them.”
In a post on Saturday at the library Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "has a mission to provide commercial energy and one ecosystem that will help to provide the necessary services."
In 1994, Berners-Lee ran the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been one of the influential voices in the debate about the neutrality of the Internet.
Even though Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this new network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Honoring the priest of the First World War, bearer of the Viktoria Cross
The only priest of the Church of England who was awarded the Viktoria Cross as a fighter for the time of the First World War, is honored in his 100th birthday.
Lieutenant Colonel Venerable Bernard Van served this distinction on the 29th of September, 1918, with the occasion of the attack on Belangliz and Leokur.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, and he never realized that he had won the highest British military medal.
Her two grandchildren discovered a memorial plaque on Saturday during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plates were discovered exactly 100 years after his death.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal.
After that, he rushed to the line of fire and, with the "most recent heroism," led the attack before he single-handedly attacked the artillery and ejected three men from the line.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I'd never be able to do, but something he's been saying is a big deal."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid down a wreath after a parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Van said that he "feels very honored for what he did in the parade" and added that "it was a hero's legacy to the nation."
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, and instead of that they got Pepa Prasa.
You think you've stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, and you've been able to watch the main event.
The event at San Jose included 13 fights, including a sixth in the main area and was live-streamed in the UK on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the UK observers were left behind when the transfer was made to Pepu.
Some were shocked when they stayed up until the next morning because of that fight.
One fan described the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke".
"According to the state transcript, that report at 6 a.m. was not logged, so they had to transfer to the children's draft," said Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president of the White House.
"'Pepa Prasa', yes."
The president of the company, Bellathor Scott Cocker, said he would be working on his pre-game scheme to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think as far as reruns are concerned, I think we’ll probably manage to get it done,” said Cocker.
"But there's six in the morning and we won't be able to fix it until we get to our time, our Mondays, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was over, there were a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical disturbance.
But it wasn't, it was a problem for the state.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We're going to keep fighting for five instead of six - like we usually do - we've tried to get our fans to give us more than we usually do.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There's an unfortunate situation at stake."
Dysert Island Discs: Tom Daly Felt “Inferior” for Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he's grown to feel an inferiority in relation to other reasons for his sexuality - but it's given him a lot of motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old says that to the seniors, the elementary school didn’t realize that “not everyone is like him.”
Speaking to Radio 4 in the first edition of the show, Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Lawern, said he was talking about gay rights as other people would have it.
He also said he's been worried about winning the Olympics ever since he became a parent.
A regular long-time show host, Kirsty Young, took a few months' leave of absence because of illness.
By giving away the impression that the cast of the first Laverno broadcast had made, Daley said that he felt "less valuable" than the rest of the cast had grown up because "it wasn't society."
He said: “By the time I was present, that feeling that I was inferior and that I was different, that was the real thing that gave me the power and the snow to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “some and some,” he said, so he wouldn’t have disappointed everyone when they ended their relationship with him.
The two-time winner of the bronze Olympian medal has become a prominent champion for LGBT rights and has used his access to the annual Games of the House of Representatives in Astra d.o.o.
He says that he spoke because he felt happy that he could live open, without the consequences, and because he wanted others to “hope.”
The three-time world champion says he was "suddenly" infatuated with the male, American director Dustin Lance Bleck, whom he met in 2013.
Daley got married last year to an oscar who's 20 years older than he is, but he says there's a reason in years he's never faced a problem.
"When you cross so many paths in such an age," he went to the first Olympiad at 14 years old, and his father died of three years later.
The two of them had become parents in June, they had a son, Robert Ray Black-Daily, and the Daily said that he had "read the entire spectrum" changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been just ‘I have to win my gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things about the Olympic gold medalists.
"Roby is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being found to have brain cancer.
Daley says that his father didn't accept that he was going to die in 2012 and that one of his last questions was whether or not he already had tickets to the Olympics in London.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘Dad, you’re not going to live to be in the first row,’” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he started breathing, and just when he started to breathe and he died, I finally realized that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this is what I’ve been dreaming about all my life - that I’m going after the audience at the Olympic Games, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
That feeling also inspired his election of the first song "Praud" by Heather Small, who resonated with him in preparation for the Olympics and beyond.
The show is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. British Summer Time.
Mickelson for dropping out of the office put on the bench for the Ryder Cup Saturday
America's Phil Mickelson will set the record for the week he plays his 47th match at the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to go back to work to avoid the opportunity.
Mickelson, who's taking part in this two-year event for the record-breaking 12th time, captain Jim Furick has sent to the bench for Saturday's game of four balls and a game of poker.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as played so often in the United States, the five-time champion will spend as much time as he did as a cheerleader and I do.
Since even at the height of his career he was not the most precise in the distant strokes, this 48-year-old is not an ideal candidate for the narrow field of "Le Golf Nationale", where the long-term goal is to achieve the highest level of success.
And if the field I'm looking for isn't enough for both of us to encourage, then Michelson is in his ninth match in the week facing the champion of British Open France Molinary.
If the Americans, who are four years old, start 12 individual swords, they'll have a tough start, Michelson's sword would be absolutely capable of making a judgment.
Furik pointed out that he had confidence in his man, although he could not say anything else.
“He fully understood the deposit that he had today, he gave me a hand in the back, he hugged me and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furik said.
“There’s a lot of confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame, and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past, and so much to this week.
I probably didn't plan on him playing two matches.
I planned higher, but that's how it worked out and that's the way we decided to go.
He wanted to be there, as much as anyone else."
Mickelson's gonna break Nick Faldo's record for the last few months in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never reached the height of its personal record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven losses, but Furik said he felt left behind in the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's great to have him in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed the opportunity to tease him, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He's playing a lot more than just a game."
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage may soon be found.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a significant advantage on the eve of the last day of the individual months on the Ryder Cup can be easily assumed.
The day he made his debut in 1997 in a match at Walderami, where a party he'd led to Balesteros had a lead of five against the Americans, but he's got a five-point lead on the Americans.
"I keep remembering how we've had a big advantage over Walderam; we've had a big advantage over Brooklyn, where we've lost, and on Walderam, where we've won.
So, history will show me and everything on that team that there's no end to it.
We're going full steam tomorrow.
Let's go out there and do everything we need to do.
There's nothing left until you don't have anything on you.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus will be.
I keep saying that, I focus on 12 players from our side, but I also focus on how we're aware of what's in the opposite side -- the best players in the world."
Delighted by the game of his players on the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run in front of the ore as far as it goes.
Tomorrow's something completely different.
Tomorrow's individual performance comes to the fore, and that requires a different game.
It's nice to be out there with a partner when things really work out like they need to, but when you're out there alone, then your full golfing capacity is in the exam.
It's a message that you have to play with, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he's got to come out of himself."
For the reasons of Bjorn, captain of the rival team, Jim Furrick, will seek out his players for a better individual performance than what they've done with the partners, except for Jordan Sunder.
And Furik himself was on both sides of those big turnovers in the last day, first as part of a winning team on Brooklyn, and then as a loser when the European team pulled off the Miracle.
“I remember literally every word,” he said, questioning how Ben Krenshaw, the 1999 captain, had raised morals with his players while they were sleeping.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important moons, but it would be good to have a fast star like the one you saw on Brooklyn and the one you saw on Medina.
When that's what's going on in one direction, there's a lot of pressure going on in the middle of the competition.
We're making our own position and boys' way of doing it the way we think we should, you know, try to make a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the final match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ramm.
"I'm on my way to this group of guys in that neighborhood because I think that's how we're covering everything until the end," Bjorn said.
NEW DEPARTMENT FOR A NEW GERMAN WAR BOARD
The last few fragments of the non-native Navy girls needed to get into use in 2014, so they could replace the old ships from the back of the Cold War, but they won't be able to do that.
They're going to be launching Rynland-Falco, the flagship of the new class of the Baden-Wirtemberg frigate, now it's scheduled for the first half of 2019.
It was necessary to join the Navy in 2014, but after the delivery, the problems caused the future of this ambitious project.
Four vessels of the Baden-Wirtemberg class commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Fregate class of Bremen.
It is well known that they will possess a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and pre-shipping missiles, as well as a certain type of stealth technology, such as a rogue operation, aiding and abetting, aiding and abetting.
Other important characteristics include longer periods of work without maintenance - you should be able to see the latest frigates for two years.
However, the constant delay means that these most important warships - which should be able to operate in Germany - will be able to operate their own ships.
The ill-fated frigate F125 arrived at the newly minted address of the previous year when the German Navy official decided to take him back to the shipyard and return him to the shipyard.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have announced more crucial "software and hardware effects" that would make this battleship a biscotti.
The software shortages were particularly important, as half of the crew would have been on board with Baden-Wirthemberg managing the crews of about 120 sailors.
Also, it turns out that the weight of the ship is drastically exceeded, which would diminish its perforation and limit the ability of the Navy to make it more advanced.
It is thought that Rynland-Falz weighs 7,000 pounds twice as much as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the fake hardware, the price of the entire project - including the training of the crew - has also begun to preface the problem.
It is said to have reached an unprecedented 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - of the initial 2.2 billion euros.
I'm going to have to deal with the latest concerns about coming forward in particular to reflect on recent warnings about the reduction of non-native powers.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Burttels, the head of the committee for the defense of the German parliament, confirmed that the Navy had actually "done its job".
This official has pointed out that the weather is becoming more and more serious, because the boats are being sold without introduction of the land vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Fund is listening to the secret life of bats
The new research that leads to one of the properties in Scotland hangs out with the goal of finding out how bats use geographer-like terrain in search of food.
The researchers hope that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will help guide future activities towards their goal.
The research of scientists from the National Fund for Scotland will be accompanied by ordinary and dwarfed by muscles, as well as brown long-eared lilies and watered wedding wreaths at Inv.
Special devices for filming will be placed at key locations throughout the range in order to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
Staff and volunteers of the National Health Service of Scotland (NHS) will also conduct mobile examinations with manual detectors.
The expert analysis of the sound from all the recordings will determine the frequency of the voices of the bats and what kind they do.
Then a detailed map of the habitat will be prepared with a report to get a picture of their behavior in relation to the field.
Rob Djuar, a conservation advisor at the Fund, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are the most important for the mice's survival and the manner in which they are being used.
These information will contribute to the determination of the predestination of the dwellings like the creation of the foundry, as well as to the other things that can be done to improve the sound of the forest.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined considerably in the last century.
They are faced with construction and development work that affects nesting and loss of habitat.

However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They rely on sophisticated echo-location techniques to determine the exact location of the insect and the obstacle to the flight path.
The NTS Fund, which is responsible for the care of over 270 buildings of historical importance, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious.
The Fund has a dozen trained experts who are regularly researching, checking nesting grounds, and sometimes rescue actions.
This organization has even achieved the first and only purpose-built reserve for bats in Scotland, on the territory of Triv in the area of Dumfries and Galovye, which is home to mice in Scotland, on the territory of Triv in the area of Dumfries and Galovye.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says that this is an ideal territory for them.
“Here in Triv we have a great table for the bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, old trees and a good habitat.
But a lot of things about bats are still unknowable, so we're going to have to work here and on other things to help them better understand what they need to do."
It emphasizes the importance of the presence of blind mice and the presence of blind mice before the performance of the work to be maintained in the asset pool, because it is by accident the destruction of one nesting site in the asset pool.
Blind mice are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass or harass and destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official at the Fund for the Protection of Bats, encourages the public to include themselves in their contributions.
She says: “And we need to learn a lot about our blind mice, and for many of our species, we still don’t know how to count.”
Ronaldo dropped the rape charges, filed a lawsuit against a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges against him as "false news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are urging him to sue the German magazine Spiegel, which published you.
The attacker of Juvenus and Portugalia was accused of raping an American woman by the name of Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was paying her 375,000 dollars so she wouldn't talk about the incident, Spiegel reported on Friday.
Referring to 142 million of his followers in the "Instagram Live" video following the publication of the charges, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "false news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," he said in the camera of the five-time Golden Ball winner.
“They want to use my name.
That's normal.
He wants to become famous for what he's going to say with my name, but that's part of it.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," he added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Spiegel for allegations they have described as "unacceptable reports of suspicion in the area of privacy," according to R. R. R. R.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the football player would seek the reward of "the moral damage in the amount that leads to the crime of the offense, which is likely to result in a violation of the law."
The incident took place in June 2009 at the apartment in the hostel and the Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga had recently returned to the player's room, where he had recently been raped, according to a statement from the local police department.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo after the incident fell to his knees claiming that he was "99 percent a good guy" but that he had let go because of those "one percent".
In the records, it is claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was on a good base.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police with photos of her injuries made in the hospital, but that she subsequently accepted an out-of-court settlement because she felt "horrified" because she felt "indignant".
This 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the settlement now because she's still suffering from a potential incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the attack at the time of the transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer, for 100 million euros, he crossed the border into Italy.
Brexit: UK 'would never have suffered' loss of carmaker
The UK would "never regret it" if after Brexit it lost its status as a world leader in a car dealership, says Minister Greg Clark.
He added that "it's worrying" that Toyota UK has declared for the BBC that it would leave the EU if Britain were to abandon the EU without any agreement that it was temporarily shut down in the vicinity of Barn.
“We need to get along,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker announced that it would be in the border in the case of Brexit without a deal that caused the loss of working places.
The factory in Barnaston -- which operates that auris and avencis -- produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were produced in the rest of Europe.
“My point of view is that we will have a stoppage in the factory if Britain is to steal the mark from the EU,” said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota’s factory in Barnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of the transport sector.
Be-Em-We, for instance, says that after Brexit, it will be a month before we can close down our factory in Oxford.
The main reasons for concern are the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of Brexit without any agreement, say car manufacturers.
Toyota’s production line functions on the principle of “exactly on time”, where the parts for the ordered cars arrive at every 37 minutes from the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, it could lead to a delay on the border for which industry representatives say it could lead to a delay and a delay.
Toyota wouldn't be able to store an investor for more than one day in her factory in Darbyshire, the company had already announced, and that would be a stopover.
Clark says that Theresa May's plan from Checkers is in conjunction with the future relationship with the EU "precisely calibrated to avoid such checks on the border."
“We need a slow-down. We want the best slow-down that will enable us, as I would say, not just a quick-run success, it’s not going to take advantage of this.”
“Consistency is not just from Toyota, but from other manufacturers, they say that absolutely we need to be in the capacity to continue what we’ve shown ourselves to be able to do.”
TOYOTA COULDN'T SAY HOW MUCH IT WOULD TAKE TO CLOSE THE PRODUCTION, BUT I GUESS IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO CLOSE THE COSTS TO THE COMPETITION OF THE FABRIC AND THE FABRIC
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working at Barnaston for 24 years and who is a functionary of the union Junajt in the factory, says that his members are all more concerned: “In my experience, it is
The government spokesman said: “We have come up with a precise and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be over again, White House officials say
An important meeting between Donald Trump and the Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "determined for another week."
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mahler, who investigates Russia's involvement in the election, the relationship between Trump's proxy and Russia and the possibility of the election.
The question is whether Trump will replace the deputy attorney general or not, and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence, but for months, it's a threat to Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been talking about eavesdropping on a recording of Trump and the possibility of a seizure.
Rosenstein put that one away.
But the last Monday he went to the White House, in fact, he was getting ready to leave.
Instead of that, a meeting with Trump, which was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that "the people would not have acted" had Rosenstein been impeached, but that the meeting was determined to avoid prosecution.
Trump on Friday ordered a joint investigation of the FBI into Kavanaugh's indictment, further delaying the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump's spokeswoman for the press, Sara Sanders, showed up at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein, she replied: “There’s still no date, there could be weeks, there could be days, there could be days, there could be days, there could be days, there could be days.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press blagoved."
Some reporters might be able to back up that claim: Sanders’s statement of September 10 did not hold the White House’s press release.
Chris Wallace was asking for what.
Sanders said she wanted to "apply attention," but she said, "I wouldn't say that if I didn't want to pay attention."
Then she suggested that there would be a direct contact between Trump and the recruiter.
“The president has a higher conference in which he is asked about any other president before him,” she said, without saying, “I’m sorry.”
And there will still be a generalization, Sanders said, but “if the recruiters have the opportunity to directly pose questions to the president of the United States, that’s unsatisfactory.
We try to do that often, and we see that in many ways we've done what we've done in the past few weeks, and that's what's going to happen instead of what we're going to do in the past.
Trump is regularly asked to leave the White House, or when he participates in open sessions, or in a new conference with visiting officials.
Self-conferencing for the press is rare.
The President may have demonstrated this week in New York because of what he did, since he behaved casually in front of the gathered donors, and bizarrely.
The Ministry of Health wrote to workers from the EU in the National Health Service of Škotska due to the anxiety of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the staff of the European Union who work in the National Health Service of Scotland in order to express the gratitude of their country and to call them "Brovnost".
The head of the Scottish Parliament, Gene Freeman, sent a letter at the moment when there was less than six months to go before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already announced that it will be covering the cost of the resolved applications for the construction of a European Union citizen who works in its competent public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations for the UK’s exit from the EU have continued for the summer, going as expected in the autumn.
But the UK government is also working to prepare for a possible scenario without achieving agreement.
I know this must be a disturbing time for all of you.
So now I want to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the staff, no matter what the nationality.
The courses from the parts of the European Union, and beyond, provide us with valuable experience and skills that empower and improve our work in the field of health services, to the benefit of the community.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we'd very much like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie has been urgently operated on after suffering a head injury.
Linebacker Tennessee State Tigers' Kristion Abercrombie has been rushed into surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's repatriation with a result of 31-27 over Wand.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that he was in charge of getting his head in half the time.
“He came to the out-of-the-line, and he was just about there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie the oxygen in the car before they put him on the nose and put him away for further questioning.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been transferred to the Vanderbilt Medical Center as he had been cleared.
Harris added that “there’s still no detail about the type/seriousness of the injury” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it came to the injury.
Abercrombie, the red jersey from another year, is currently in its first season with Tennessee State after the Ilinois transfer.
On Saturday, he had five tackles before he quit the game, which brought his total number of tackles in the season to 18.
FORMER customers will be charged a higher amount of taxable stamps when purchasing real estate in the UK
Stakeholders will be charged more than the amount of taxes due to the purchase of immovable property in the UK, and additional income will be used to help the homeless with new funding.
This move will not lead to the success of Corbyn's effort to attract younger voters.
The increase in the amount of excise duty will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds annually to help the homeless.
For the most part, customers will be charged more than the amount of taxes due to the purchase of real estate in the UK, and additional income will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be interpreted as an attempt to avoid the success of Jeremy Corbyn in an effort to attract younger voters to promise to give them access to a more accessible position.
The increase in taxable margins will be applied to a physical and legal person who does not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will be used to contribute to the fight against tax in the UK.
An additional charge - which is added to the already existing taxable mark, including a two-year-old will be presented for the second home and purchase of the property.
The Treasury expects that thanks to this step of the year, up to 120 million pounds will be collected.
It's estimated that 13 percent of the new construction in London is being purchased by non-residents of the UK, which raises prices and makes it harder for people who buy the first home to get to the housing floor.
Many rich parts of the country - especially the pre-frontiers - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign shoppers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new memo comes in just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called in to change the tax rate so he could help the young people get their hands on it.
He accused large-scale construction companies of holding high prices for real estate by seizing land, but he did not take advantage of it, and he urged May's prime minister to issue a quota to buy it.
Corbyn has announced a striking array of proposed residential reforms, including a controle of rents and the end of unclaimed evictions.
He also wants to authorize the construction of new homes.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime ministerial mandate to the renewal of the British dream - that life would be better for all of this.
And that encourages and solves problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to the people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it can't be right to buy real estate as much as it is for a British building.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too distant, while the humiliation of homelessness has become too real."
Jack Ross: “My last ambition is to run Scotland.”
Sanderland boss Jack Ross says that his "final ambition" is to become a manager of Scotland's national team at some point.
Four-and-a-half-year-old Škot enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east which is currently in the third place of the first league, three points from the top.
This flight moved to the stadium after Saint-Miren returned to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country like a football player.
I was in the B-team of representation and that's it," Ross told the show's "Sportsound" at the BBC's "Scottish."
“But I grew up often watching Scotland at Hempden when I was little, and that was something I was always coming back to.
However, such an opportunity would be provided only if I was successful in running the club."
Ross's predecessors as Sanderland's managers include Dick Advokat, David Moyiz, Sam Allerdys, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet, and Paul Diall.
The former head of Alois athletics says he wasn't anxious about coming after such big names to such a big club, after he refused to bid on Barnsley and Ipswich.
“Merrillo’s success at this point will be in that ‘I’m going to be able to get this club back in the Premier League.’
“In line with the structure and possibilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get him there, but I think I’ll be able to see myself as a success if I can get the club back where it belongs.”
Ross is only three years into his senior career, after a period he's spent as assistant chief in Dumbarton and 15 months in training.
Then he helped Alo recover from the fall in the third division, and Sent Miren took from the edge of the fall in the minor leagues to the winner in the championship next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably the right thing to do,” he said, recalling taking over the Aloa Club.
“I really believed that management was the right thing to do for me, more than play.
It sounds weird because I haven't been bad, I've been solidly earning from it and I've enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing knows how to be difficult.
There's a lot of things you have to do to get to the next level.
And I'm still going through that in terms of stress and pressure, but I'm just a manager.
I've always wanted to be in charge of management, and I'm doing it now, in all my adult life, I haven't felt more comfortable than I do now."

The perfect time for a mug is 17.30 on Saturdays, the research reveals
The summer heat wave increased the shift for the british harvests that are fighting for survival, but it increased the pressure on the chain of events.
In the group of harvests and harvests, growth was achieved from 2.7 per cent in July - but the shift in restaurants dropped by 4.8 per cent, as the figures show.
Peter Martin of the consular company CGA, which has been working on the figures, says: “For the duration of the sundial and longer than expected, England will participate in the World Cup.
When we moved from 1.8 to June, we only got worse in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the drinks had a far better effect with greater growth in relation to the comparative results from the previous period than the previous year.
Bob's food-focused crews were also suffering from the sun, but not as dramatic as the owners of the restaurant.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for drinks.
The chains of pickings and barrows have increased the liquor sales by 6.6 percent for the month of the day, and now they're selling food from three percent."
Paul Newman from the RSM agency for entertainment and hospitality analysis says: “This is the result of the continuing trend that we’ve seen since the end of April.
Timely opportunities and influence of the main social and sports events are still the main factors when it comes to selling on the market outside of the household.
It's not a surprise that the group is still struggling, even though it's going to sell out at 4.8 percent of the year-to-year level.
It's been a long time since hot summers could have come to a worse time to host food-focused meals, and the weather will show whether or not the temperatures we have in store will be moderated."
Total growth of sales in the companies and restaurants, including new constructions, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, contributing to the successful introduction of the new brand.

Ailee Doyle will be the “voice of the athlete” in the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Ailey Doyle was elected for a member of the Scottish Athletic Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general session of that governing organ.
Doyle is the most valuable Scottish athlete and chairman of Ian Beatty described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to get a foothold in their shoes.
"Aily enjoys a great deal of respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the wider world, and we're sure that the athletics in Scotland will have huge benefits from her."
Doyle said, “I want to be the voice of the athlete and hopefully I can really make a contribution and help lead the sport in Scotland.”

I'm saying that the milk pump, in which the mother's orders were to distribute the cow's opinion on the Internet.
The company that runs the milking pumps has divided the opinion on the internal wording that comes from the cows of the husbands.
How would you describe the launch of a product described as "the first unheard pump for a milking that is carried under the bra", the manufacturer of the consumer's pump said.
The four real mothers dance in the shadows and cows along with a song whose lyrics read: "Yes, I do, but I don't have a tail" and "Maybe they didn't notice it, but they didn't see it."
The chorus continues: “Pump, pump, feed your baby, pump, pump, milk yourself.”
However, it was announced on Facebook that she had contacted the Internet.
With 77,000 views and one hundredth of a centimeter, he saw the different reactions of the mills, while many said it lessened the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this performance was a very poor decision.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but with it, their babies are robbed of a few days after birth," he wrote.
Elvie discreetly steps into her bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: “It’s clear that it’s traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why don't you just use it to tell the pump about the mother who can keep her baby?"
He added, “It’s just unspoken words.”
Others stood at the side of the ad, and one woman admitted that her song was "hurried".
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd like to keep this coming.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
She said she's a little crazy, but I figured she's the way she needs to be.
“This is genius,” he wrote.
Someone else said, “This is ridiculous words directed at moms who milk milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel the same way.
This is not a word that praises or kudi the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were all dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept is based on the knowledge that many mothers who milk milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, there are no wires, no tubes, and it fits into the bra for coming, as women give freedom to move, keep their baby, then even go out.
Anna Ballarin, partner and executive creative director of the company Mother, gave a comment: “The Elvie pump is so innovative that it serves both purpose and purpose.
By drawing a parallel between the beating in women and lactating cows, we wanted to highlight the beating and challenges it brings with it, as well as to present the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides in a way that is fun and that women can connect with.

Hundreds of migrant children moved to temporary camp on Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased considerably, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the harsh rhetoric and policies the Trump administration has introduced to make it difficult to house children with sponsors.
As usual, the sponsors themselves were mostly illegal immigrants without documents and fear that they would jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country if they came forward and asked for a child.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households had to submit fingerprints, as well as that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Police official, confirmed before Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor uncaring minors.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of the people who were sponsors or members of the sponsors’ households are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are criminally prosecuted foreigners.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That's why we're still pursuing those persons," said Mr Albens.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the shelter workers, in order to process the children faster, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear before the court within a month after being detained, instead of within 60 days, which was the previous standard.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most will use conference video instead of a personal presence to apply for legal status to an immigration judge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Those found not to meet the conditions for release will be deported as soon as possible.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to report anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape, according to shelter workers and system reports during the previous months.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Advocates say concerns about this have been raised in larger facilities such as the Tornillo, where indications that the child is being tortured can be easily overlooked due to size.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They add that moving children to a temporary settlement without leaving them enough time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to friends can cause traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also urged refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in their country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said before the assembly.
Muallem said the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions have left their homeland.
He also said Damascus would continue to “run its holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “the entire illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly trained and advised by both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground of a war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Muallem said there were satisfactory conditions for them to return, and accused “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational fear” over which refugees remain out of the country.
“We have sent an invitation to the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist in their return,” he said.
“They are making a policy out of something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition that will end the war.
UN diplomats say an agreement recently reached between Russia and Turkey to set up a vacuum zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has led to the creation of opportunities for further development of political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement drew attention from the large-scale attack by Syrian forces who enjoy Russian support in the province, where three million people live.
Muallem, however, stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the goal of military actions will be jihadists along with fighters from the Nusra Front, associated with al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition will take place soon, with the aim of drafting a post-war constitution that would allow Syria to hold elections.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of that panel should be limited to reviewing articles of the current constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Trump will win a second term

>>srp_Cyrl<< So far, there are no signs of fatigue in viewers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ratings in primetime have more than doubled since 2014 reaching 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled from 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million viewers on primetime, more than the 1.7 million they had four years ago, according to Nielsen, while the “Rachel Meadow Show” of the MSNBC network holds the top spot on cable television with as many as 3.5 million viewers in the days of the most important news.
“It’s a line people get dragged into because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neil Burr, the lead producer of the ABC series Acting Secretary of the Cabinet who becomes president after the Capitol’s destruction in the attack.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Foreign money inflow amid tense race for early elections in Presidential House
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district receives an influx of money, thanks to a reshuffle of congressional districts that causes two lawmakers to fight for the same seat.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Thus, Connor Lamb, a representative of the Democrats of Pittsburgh's suburban district, recently turned out, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lamb is in a race with another MP, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cards were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had unconstitutionally rigged the election results in favor of the Republicans.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The race in the new 17th launched a bidding campaign to fund campaigns between the party's largest financiers, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lamb was rumored to be in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely followed special March election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That seat was held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the election by 20 points.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Political connoisseurs gave Trump a slight advantage.
U.S. Considers Penalizing Salvador for Supporting China, So It Withdraws
>>srp_Cyrl<< Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with opposition from Washington.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In June 2017, Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. representatives of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Noert, a spokeswoman for the Department earlier this month.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the penalties only applied to Salvador who received US aid in 2017 in an estimated amount of $140 million, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The imposed punitive measures, which include cutting financial aid and targeted visa regime restrictions, would hardly fall to a Central American state that already has a high unemployment and murder rate.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic progress to accompany a similar gathering last year that they considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But by mid-September, the administration's top officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and put an end to all questions about penalizing Salvador.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was announced that Vice President Mike Pence would be dealing with the conference, whose new term is mid-October, indicating the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, according to diplomats.
And so the three American envoys quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh messages or punitive measures from Washington.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on internal issues on the condition that they remain anonymous.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, also anonymously.
Study the history
>>srp_Cyrl<< The next inevitable thing is likely to be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, about which there is already substantial evidence in public sources.
Mueller is also reportedly launching an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in connection with the election attacks.
If Congress were to take over, Trump would face responsibility in that body, as he prepares to go before voters again, and possibly even before a colleague’s court.
That’s a lot of unconfirmed possibilities, and I don’t want to say that Trump’s defeat is inevitable, nor the defeat of his equals in Europe.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, need to make decisions that will determine how long the difficulties will last.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 1938, German officers were prepared to take a coup against Hitler, that the West was able to resist him and deter the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We failed to do so, and missed the opportunity to avoid the carnage that followed in the following years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Americans now face several such turning points.
>>srp_Cyrl<< What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who governs the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in unbridled grapes since the newspaper announced that he had proposed last year to secretly record the president and comment on his ineligibility for office.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Rosenstein says the Times statement is incorrect.
“How do we react when Brett Cavanaugh’s newly launched investigation into the Ef-Bi is neither complete nor fair, or if he receives approval from the Supreme Court, despite reliable allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
>>srp_Cyrl<< And above all, will we vote in early elections for a Congress that considers Mr. Trump trustworthy?
>>srp_Cyrl<< If we fail those exams, democracy is in for a long winter.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But I believe we will not fail thanks to a lesson I learned in Prague.
>>srp_Cyrl<< My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess, and she was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that swastika table.
>>srp_Cyrl<< With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrance from Rangers optimistic before meeting Rapid Wien
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Rangers welcome Rapid Wien on Thursday, aware that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive tie with Villareal in Spain earlier this month, would bring them a firm position for qualification from the Group G of the Europa League.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Graham Doran, a midfield player, due to a knee injury could not appear in the season until a 2-2 tie with Villareal, but believes the Rangers can use that score as a springboard for larger goals.
“It’s a good point for us because Villareal is in a better position,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game with the belief that we could win something, and we came out with a point.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We might have been able to get them in the end, but taking everything into account, the even score is quite fair.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They were probably better than us in the first half, but we came back in the second and took off.
Thursday is approaching and it will be another big night for Europe.
We hope that we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a great result from the last game. Although, with the audience on our side, I am sure that we can get stuck and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, with everything that happened to me with injuries and changes in the club itself, but the current position is satisfactory.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it, the training is good.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We hope we can get stuck now, leave last season behind and achieve success."
Women worried about retirement savings
>>srp_Cyrl<< Despite the fact that the participants of the examination clearly knew what kind of care they wanted to receive, very few discussed it with families.
>>srp_Cyrl<< About half of those surveyed in the Nationwide study said they talked to spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them say they’ve talked to the kids about it.
“People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance firm.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family for providing care if you don’t introduce them to your desires well enough in advance.
Together with the counselor and family, decide where and how you want to receive care because these are choices that greatly affect the cost.
Include a financial advisor: he can help you find a way to cover those costs.
Your long-term care financial decisions may include the usual permanent care insurance policies, a hybrid life insurance policy that entails money and value to cover costs or self-insurance from your own property, as long as you have money.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Arrange your legal documentation: preempt court disputes.
Take a health care assistant to have a trustworthy person you can trust to take care of medical care and make sure healthcare professionals are aware of your wishes in case you are unable to declare yourself.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Also, consider giving financial management authority.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and take care that the bills are paid on time if you are not able to do so.
Do not forget about the details: Imagine that your aged parent comes to a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can You Answer Questions About Medications and Allergies?
Please provide these details in writing so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just finances at stake, it’s questions like who are the doctors?” asks Martin.

Man shot multiple times with Ilfracom air rifle
>>srp_Cyrl<< The man was shot repeatedly with an air rifle as he was returning home from his exit.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The victim, a man in his forties, was in a section of Ilfracom in Devon called Oxford Grove, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. British summer time, as a “random act.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The injuries are not life-threatening, and police have directed a plea to witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
>>srp_Cyrl<< At least 384 people have lost their lives in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise, according to official sources.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Due to broken ties, emergency relief officials could not obtain information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
>>srp_Cyrl<< More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster struck.
Here are the most important facts about Palu and Dongali on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 from 2017.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The city was in the midst of a 40th anniversary celebration at the time of the earthquake and tsunami.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dongala is a regency spanning a length of more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) by the coastal line of Sulawesi Island.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Regency, a lower-level administrative region than the province, had an estimated semi-lation of 299,200 people in 2017.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The economy of the province of North Sulawesi relies largely on fishing and livestock farming, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in the Morovali area, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulevasi.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Palu and Dongala have experienced multiple tsunami impacts in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Management Agency's records.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the 1938 Dongala tsunami, more than 200 people lost their lives, and thousands of houses were destroyed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tsunami struck western Dongala again in 1996 when it claimed nine casualties.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Indonesia lies on the seismic fire belt of the Pacific and is a regular target of earthquakes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These are the largest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
>>srp_Cyrl<< 2004: A major earthquake that hit the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed 226,000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of the population of Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hundreds of people have lost their lives on the island of Nias opposite the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, triggering a tsunami that plunged to the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of Zaparna Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< 2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of as much as 10 meters in whose impact destroyed dozens of villages and lost about 300 lives.
2016: An earthquake of less depth hit the Pidyjay Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the destruction caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There were no tsunamis this time around, but more than 100 people lost their lives in collapsed buildings.
>>srp_Cyrl<< 2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, taking more than 500 lives, most of them in the northern part of the island.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily without residence.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
>>srp_Cyrl<< Trek Paylin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Paylin, was arrested on harassment charges.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to a report published by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, the twenty-nine-year-old Peylin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as domestic violence charges and resisting arrest.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged offences, he took her phone away.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Peylin was held in custody at Mats and was set to be bailed out at $500, KTUU reports.
On Saturday, he appeared in court where he said he was "certainly not guilty" when asked, the network reported.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Peylin faces three Class A violations, meaning he could receive a one-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was also charged with a Class B offence punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is not the first time a criminal complaint has been filed against Paylin.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The case is currently in court for Alaska veterans.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing a felony report and possessing a weapon in an alcoholic state in connection with the incident.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His girlfriend claimed that he punched her in the face with his fist.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sarah Peylin was criticized by veterans' groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSP) that arose due to warfare in Iraq.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tsunami caused by earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
>>srp_Cyrl<< At least 384 people have died after an earthquake occurred on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Electricity and communications networks have been discontinued, and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The earthquake struck only central Sulawesi located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami crashed ashore.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October and mow pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight people and "deliberately" caused grievous bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in New York's southern district.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the court document both counts carry a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed 22 indictments against Saipov involving eight counts of racketeering murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov had brought him out as “disgusting, cruel and corrupt.”
“Syfulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Lore Dicat, Derena Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernán Ferucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Panucho,” the statement said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted the death penalty.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to court documents, Saipov who is originally from Uzbekistan did not repent in the days and months following the attack.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The indictment alleges that Saipov told authorities that he was prompted to carry out the attack by videos of ISIS on his phone.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police said he also asked for the flag of ISIS to stand out in his hospital room.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He pleaded not guilty to the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "apparently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a guilty plea with life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Saip's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at a Conservative party conference.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Former UKIP leader said politicians should face Euroscepticism - as one of Theresa May's parliament members suggested, he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have “already come out” if Mr Farage had been secretary of Brexit.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the challenge facing Mrs May in reconciling her divided ranks has been highlighted by the views of conservatives who are in favour of staying and joining a separate city protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to follow the Chequers compromise plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, supporters of the stay and the EU.
The Allies insist on continuing their efforts to reach a deal with Brussels despite the reaction - and to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its offer and its chaos.
Mr. Bone said at a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihal that he wanted to “reject the Chequers.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< He suggested that Mr Farage should become equal and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If I were responsible, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellinborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers.”
Stressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight world wars to be submissive.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit, also attended the protest and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for him, it is not popular in our party and with our activists who actually take to the streets and put us first.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Release the Chequers and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Premieres keep their place when they keep their promises.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mr Farage told the crowd that politicians must face problems if they decide to issue a decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we’re not going to let them get away with it.’
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on its way to betray Brexit, to feel the rising tide.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that won the victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Meanwhile, supporters of the remains walked through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
Many activists waved banners at the Conservatives against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lord Adonis, the Labour leader, mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party application since the conference opened.
“These are the people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus solution, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a total farce.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to carefully consider entering the race for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider well into the race for president” after the November elections.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at City Hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Dill, a Republican party representative, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is speculated that Warren could replace Trump in 2020.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time “for women to go to Washington to recover a shaken government, and that means a woman at the top.”
Suspect Who Shot Sims, LSU Player Arrested
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect who shot and killed LSU basketball player, Wade Sims, had been arrested.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, age 20, at 11:00 ET at the conference.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They released a video of Friday's shootings and asked for help in identifying the man seen in the video.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sims, 20, was killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims was shot in the head and instantly passed away,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the media via channel 247sports.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Wade stood up for his friend and Simpson shot him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was present, that he owned a weapon, and that he killed Wade Simms.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A 198.12 cm high junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Simms played 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and an average time of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins World Champion title after losing to Sebastian Fetel
>>srp_Cyrl<< From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that Mercedes' team would play a major role in this race.
>>srp_Cyrl<< From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton because he was defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Fetel to attack his colleague.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Vettel went into boxing first and left Hamilton to rush into the crowd at the end of the lane, which was to be decisive.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mercedes left later and exited ahead of Fetel, but Hamilton overtook after driving the wheel alongside the wheel which left Ferrari's driver involuntarily in danger of retreating after a double-motion defense on the third turn.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Max Fairstaffen started from the back row and reached seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He then led in most of the race to score a quick finish and take Kimi Raikonen's fourth place.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He went into boxing in the 44th round, but could not increase his speed in the remaining eight laps so Raikonen remained in fourth place.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is a tough day because Valtery has been driving great all weekend and like a real gentleman he missed me.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The team did a great job winning the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was a bad body language.
>>srp_Cyrl<< President Donald Trump was poaching Senator Diane Finestein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she had not released a letter from Christine Blaze Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Cavanaugh, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil, rude and dishonest."
>>srp_Cyrl<< "The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, rude and dishonest," he said.
“When you look at the posts and the leaks, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diane Finestein, did you release that?
Remember her answer...did you release the document to the public - "Oh, please, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Well, wait a minute.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Did we publish it...No, we didn't," he added talking about the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing allegations against Cavanaugh, and the letter was leaked to the public in September. Feinstein dismissed the claim that information had been leaked from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t tell her story,” Feinstein told the board.
“She asked me to keep the story confidential and I kept it confidential, as she asked.”
But her denial didn’t seem to appeal to the president, who during a rally on Saturday night commented: “You know what, that was a really bad body language.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, whom three women accused of sexual abuse, the president said Democrats were using those charges for their own ends.
"They have decided to restore power by any means necessary.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You see evil, abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
>>srp_Latn<< Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
>>srp_Cyrl<< Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dundee Stars made up for the loss to the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants team by winning Saturday, in a 5-3 rematch in Dundee.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Giants team gained the advantage of two goal hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowlieu.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney brought home field advantage before Dwyer returned the Giants team lead.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lucas Landwater Nielsen's two goals secured the victory.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came on to beat Dundee 2–1 in Belfast, on Friday night.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was the fourth meeting of the season between these two teams, and the Giants team had won the previous three games.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dwyer's opener arrived at 3:35 a.m. with Kendall McFoll's assist in the fourth minute, alongside David Rutherford who provided the assist as Bowley doubled the lead four minutes later.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At the point of the busy opening, Sullivan returned the game advantage at home at 13:10 before Matt Markua assisted the tie by Kauni at 15:16.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dwyer secured the lead in the first third when he made his second shot at the end of the first half.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The hosts regrouped and Bushar tied with an excellent goal at 27:37.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cowney and Charles Corcoran helped Nilssen secure the Dundee team's lead for the first time in a game at the end of the second half and took care of his team's victory in the fifth part of the final half.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Giants team, which has lost four of its last five games, will play on Friday at home ground in Milton Keynes the next game.
Air Traffic Controller Dies To Save Hundreds Of People On Plane From Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been declared a hero after allowing a plane carrying hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
>>srp_Cyrl<< More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Strong impacts continue to shake this area and many are trapped in the ruins in the city of Pal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Despite his colleagues being evacuated, 21-year-old Antonis Gunavan Agung refused to leave the workplace in the control tower that crashed at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the city of Palu.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He remained to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He then jumped off the control tower when he saw the tower fall.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He passed away later in hospital.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sire, said that the decision made by Antonis may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken because of it,” he added.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of casualties could reach thousands, given that the National Disaster Management Agency has said that access to the cities of Dongala, Siga and Butong is limited.
“The death toll is still believed to be increasing as many bodies are still under rubble, while many cannot be reached,” a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purvo Nagroho, said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Waves that reached up to six meters destroyed Palu in which a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every moment, an ambulance brings bodies.
There is no clean water.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfend, director of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pale on Sunday and told the state army: “I ask you to work around the clock to complete all the tasks related to the rescue.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lamboc earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says one person missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, said one person was missing after it said all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The company Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, it could not find one passenger, a man.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in order to find passengers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger such as age or nationality.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew as the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuk Island.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday, and are all in stable condition.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The airline and the Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon that is close to the runway.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some witnesses think the plane missed the runway.
>>srp_Cyrl<< U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying low.
“It’s an extremely good thing,” Janes said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Janes said he and others were able to break through the water to the waist to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted and had a minor head injury.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair the piers also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 30 feet underwater.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in airliner crashes registered in the PNG over the past two decades, but none of them were Air Niugini.
Analyst shows the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
>>srp_Cyrl<< On Saturday, the prosecution completed a deposition at the retrial of a man who was charged with burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
>>srp_Cyrl<< United States Department of Justice analyst Paul Raulet testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury he used cell phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Raulet said he received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous claims.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When the data showed that his cell phone was with a cell phone belonging to the Chambers during a time period when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Senford came to testify on Saturday and stated that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because the truck was in Nashville."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cell phone records show that they had only known each other for seven days.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Raulet said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The defense is scheduled to make its final word on Sunday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The judge said he expected the trial to continue during that day.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The High Breed: What is hip hop that raises awareness?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The hip hop trio wants to change the negative image of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots - political messages and solving social issues.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They want to go back to their roots and restore the popularity of socio-political hip hop.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Performers such as Fujiz and Common again became current in the UK thanks to performers such as Akala and Louki.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Another black person?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing after 'racist' message
A nanny in New York sued a couple for discrimination and dismissal after receiving a text message from her mother in error complaining that the nanny was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist and equates the lawsuit with “extortion.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Linzi Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that the new child caregiver, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEE ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Ms Plasko-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a note.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, instead of sending her to her wife, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
When she realized the mistake, the “disturbed” Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, stating that their current nanny, who is an African-American, was not doing a good job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mrs. Morris was paid one day's work, and then Uber was invited to take her home.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Morris is now suing the couple for compensation for dismissal and seeking compensation of $350 per day for a six-month job she was originally scheduled to do living in their house, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that they can’t do that kind of thing,” she told Post magazine on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The couple rejected claims that they were racist and said that terminating Morris' employment was a reasonable move because they feared they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent something she didn’t plan on saying.
She's not a racist.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We are not racists." husband Joel Plasco told Post magazine.
“But why would you give your children away to someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, please.”
Identifying the lawsuit with "extortion", Plasco said his wife gave birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“You’re going to attack someone in that situation?
>>srp_Cyrl<< That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly disavowed this couple on social networks and denounced them for their behavior and logic.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In a newly discovered letter, we learn that the publishers of the Paddington books feared that readers would not attach themselves to the talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It's very fun to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before a small teddy bear inspired him to write this children’s book, would be optimistic even if his work had been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was “at the same time bitter and sweet” after his death last year.
For Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she said her father was discreetly proud of his final success.
“He was a quiet man and he didn’t brag,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, he felt like when people had a child who accomplished something: they were proud of him even though they didn’t actually do anything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I think Paddington's success was something like that.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although it is his work and his imagination, he always credited all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
>>srp_Cyrl<< After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Ned has regularly called to say that the situation is very bad, that he does not expect to survive,” Ms Ednan-Laperus said.
“Then I got a call from Ned telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The effect of the drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly stopped and the drugs were leaving her system.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She died some time before that and this was actually the termination of the whole system.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I just had to sit and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t moan or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I had to hold on."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, in mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside other passengers who did not know what kind of hell she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I shook my head and tears were pouring down my face the whole time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It's hard to explain, but during the summer I felt immense compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I knew how much he loved her."
Women in mourning place cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
>>srp_Cyrl<< Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on a single Welsh bridge place cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mrs Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a chef with great potential and an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They always said his smile brightened the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because “everything was getting dark.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< After taking his own life in 2014, he was found by his brother who was 11 years old at the time.
Mrs Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that there will be some consequences.”
Ms. Davis made the cards “to let people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't be silent - you need to talk to someone."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davis's for years, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He touched the bottom on Christmas Day - when the kids were opening presents, he wasn't looking them in the eye or anything."
She said his death was a major trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “It leads to family strife.
It's destroying us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But we all have to move on and fight."

>>srp_Cyrl<< Brett Cavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI launches investigation
"I thought if we really got something like what he was looking for -- an investigation with limited time and limited scope -- we might be able to come to some sort of agreement," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was "disintegrating" amid tight party pressure.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican Party want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Their opposition came about due to timing.
Since the midterm elections we are only five weeks away, they are held on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fare badly, they will be greatly weakened in their attempts to bring the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< George W. Bush continuously calls on the Senators and lobbies with them to provide support to Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases its report?
>>srp_Cyrl<< A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently seats 51 representatives of the Republican Party and 49 representatives of the Democratic Party.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is still not certain if Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the decision and send him to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea has fallen under Kim's rule.
The number of North Korean deserters who defected to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, Park Bjong-seg said there were 1127 defectors last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mr Park said stricter controls on the borders between North Korea and China and higher prices for human smuggling were key factors.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Pyongyang has made no public comments.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The vast majority of deserters from North Korea eventually obtained South Korean citizenship.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea crossed the border illegally after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most have defected via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross into due to the extremely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have been visibly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on delaying denuclearization talks.
This happened after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security and in such conditions, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm first," Mr Ree said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh ‘hysterical’, says he’s not fit to serve in Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh “hysterical” and said his temperament made him unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but feel that if a woman ever behaved like that, they would call her hysterical,” Pelosi said in reference to her reaction to the Kavanaugh hearing before the Senate Judiciary Commission on Thursday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kavanaugh emotionally dismissed accusations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were teenagers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During his opening exposure, Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost yelling and clenching his throat as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the commission, calling the charges against him a “grotesque and coordinated attack on personality” organized by liberals angry over Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he was seen to have prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself from those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Pelosi hesitated to provide an answer when asked if she would try to take Kavanaugh to court if he was admitted to the Supreme Court and if the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he shouldn't be in the Supreme Court, he should be in the court he's currently in," Pelosi said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington District Court of Appeals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Rowe v. Wade bill because he is considered a conservative judge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the subsequent hearing, Cavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say how wonderful it is,” Pelosi said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< And women should be proud of that.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It's a justifiable criticism, months and years of being overwhelmed with anger and she can't get it out of herself without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s a rare occurrence, do you?”
She continued, “I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive at a company and who said she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that implied that when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to would say, ‘You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'm angry.'
>>srp_Cyrl<< And then she'd just keep going.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That sounded great to me too."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tears are allowed as a valve for anger in part because people basically don't understand them.
One of my strongest memories is when in a previous workplace, I was mostly in an office where men were once crying with indescribable anger, and when an elderly woman caught me by my neck - a cold manager who I had always been a bit afraid of - and dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They'll think you're sad and they'll be glad they hit you like that."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Patricia Schroeder, once a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital love affair on a ship called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, the deeply frustrated Ms. Schroeder realized that there was no reason for her not to try out for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Someone called it ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'."
Since the campaign had already progressed, it lacked funds, so it vowed not to enter the race if it failed to raise $2 million.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That battle was doomed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She revealed that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
When she gave a speech saying that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overcome by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration about the system that made it so difficult to raise money to target voters instead of delegates, as well as anger about sexism - that she had her throat squeezed.
“Somebody would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled about the way the press reacted to her.
“You’d think Kleenex would be my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my headstone.
>>srp_Cyrl<< ‘She cried'?"
How a trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The initial shots in the trade war between the US and China were deafening and although the battle is not even close to an end, the gap between the countries may be suitable for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation took place this week with the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods (US$150 billion) effectively taxing half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing retaliated with the same measure each time, and lastly by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US$60 billion of goods.
China has pledged to return the US to the same measure and does not appear to be the second largest economy in the world to change its stance anytime soon.
In order for Washington to withdraw, he should bow to his demands, and public consent to the terms of the United States would be too great a shame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of a trade war with the US could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing mutual dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that making quick decisions in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions to start an economic downturn in either of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugee return, foreign minister says
>>srp_Cyrl<< Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country destroyed by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safer thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to re-establish normal conditions.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Al-Muallem said the regime in Syria would be happy to accept assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion financially.
Europe takes another victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
>>srp_Cyrl<< The European type won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The United States has suffered a sixth consecutive defeat on European soil with this and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Europe won the victory again by having Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team score the 14.5 points it needed to beat the United States.
>>srp_Cyrl<< American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during most of the tournament, threw the ball with a kick from the ti to the water on a par-3 kick at the 16th hole, thus handing the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players to ever win 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
>>srp_Cyrl<< American Jordan Spitt was outscored 5&4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, was beaten 2 and 1 by Ian Polter of England, to whom this may be the last Ryder Cup.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A veteran who played in eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European with the most wins in tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This has been a difficult year.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy that we won the cup again.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The team is the most important thing and I'm happy to be able to help," said the emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He passed the torch to his countryman John Ram who defeated American golf legend, Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Ram.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Woods lost all four matches he played in France and now has a career-high record of 13-21-3 points at the Ryder Cup.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Team USA struggled throughout the weekend with making good moves, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furick commented on his team's disappointing game "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we almost reached Europe.
We did our best.
All in all, Thomas.
He's a great captain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All 12 of his players played very well.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We'll regroup, I'll collaborate with the PGA of America Association and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We must bow.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We're outgrown."
Red tide news: Concentration shrinks in Pinelas, Manati and Sarasota districts
>>srp_Cyrl<< The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Protection Committee shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the Committee, conditions of more colorful flowering have been reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Colliery counties - indicating reduced concentration.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Flowering of the red tide extends approximately 210 kilometers of coastline from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
Stains can be found about 10 miles (16 km) offshore in Hillsboro County, but in fewer places than last week.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The mean concentration on the coast or off the coast of Pinellas County has been reported in the past week, from the coast in Hillsboro County low to high concentration, in Manati County background to high concentration, on the coast or off the coast of Sarasota County background to high concentration, in Charlotte County background to medium concentration, on the coast or off the coast of Lee County background to high concentration and small concentration in Collier County.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Respiratory irritation is still reported in Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in Northwest Florida over the past week.
