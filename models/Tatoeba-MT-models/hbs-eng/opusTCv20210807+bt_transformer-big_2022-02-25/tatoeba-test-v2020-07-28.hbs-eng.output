What a question!
The lion is the king of the jungle.
You're very brave, aren't you?

I've never noticed that before.
Is he a doctor?
Probably better not to eat after 7 p.m.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
We can't go.
Give me a hand.
Which way are you going?
I like to sleep on a soft bed.
What a question!

It's not standing.
Enough already, Tom.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom intended to ask his boss for a raise, but he changed his mind.
Come on in.
You win!
Don't take the bait.
You underestimate Tom.
Do not drink water.
That's what they both like.
Tom makes me laugh.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
Tell her I'm innocent.
>>srp_Latn<< Most scientists rejected the theory of moving continents, because it was so difficult to imagine that plate movements were even possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you tell Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them as much food as they need every day.
Tom will change.
I reacted instinctively.
You have to do it somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you post videos on YouTube?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everyone knows.

Come on in.
We're in a difficult situation.
It's just a personal opinion.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I got off at the wrong station.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't be insolent with me!
I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful.
You got it all wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's a bad kisser.
Good morning, everyone.
What time is it, please?
Start counting.
You must never come back.
He is a man of flesh and blood with all his faults.
Start with counting.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Come tomorrow.
Yeah, I love it!
He ended up in jail.
I think you're right.
How much money do we need?
Don't drink the water.

I will always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.
Tom's saving money so he can go to Boston.
Say hello to your friends.
What do you think this phrase means?
Tom tried to intimidate Mary.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
Oh, thanks.
Everybody says so.
Sorry, I didn't follow up.
Tom knows the drill.
If a man is promoted in front of a woman - this is called favoritism. If she is promoted, in front of a man, it is called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
My name is Sergei.
Come back in an hour.
Is it clear?
Tom uses that word a lot.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would rather stay.
Tom got really sick.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
You're the reason I came.
We are what we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Shut your filthy mouth.
Show me the documents.
I still mourn the death of my eldest son.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
Are you going back now?
He must be over sixty years old.
I saw Tom die.
Do you speak Romani?
He hadn't eaten all day and he was hungry.
Did you eat anything?
I've been there before.
I never learned to write.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm not Darth Vader.
I agree with what you wrote.
She's not a beauty.
Tell me what this is.
I'm available.
We need to talk about this in private.
I'm on Tom's side.
They almost got caught a couple of times.
I love this song.
Tom was John's best man.
It wouldn't make a difference.
Get me some vinegar and oil, please.
Plato is a friend, but the truth is a greater friend.
I'd really like to see you again.
You lie!
Does this make sense?
Did you get the package I sent you?
Even a child knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a painter.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved the dog very much.
You're absolutely right.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I exchanged opinions with Tom.
Her name is Lucifer.
They can never do it any other way than by force.
Is it yours?
I thought I'd get another shot at it.
He'll understand.
Tom, we have to take a cab to the station.
I'm trying to win her heart.
That's not why I'm here.
I assumed you were busy.
She's finally asleep.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom laughs at Mary.
It's almost half past three.
Jump.
We know him.
I don't know if that's gonna be enough money for me.
Can you close the curtains?
Have you tried it before?
Do not drink water from a dirty glass.
That seems inhuman to me.
Did you have lunch?
They say love is blind.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little kitty?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
I'm as happy as a cat in pyjamas.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he'd buckled his seat belt.
It looked yellow to me.
I'm celebrating.
I am strongly against compromise.
Eat slowly.
Everything has its price.
Tom picked up Mary.
Keep trying.
She doesn't use salt when she's cooking.
We got off the train.
We've always been close.
I might not sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
What the hell is this?
I went to the hospital.
We've never been here.
Sing it!
Because of the blizzard, our train was an hour late.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
He's kind.
Jawbreaker is a round multi-layered candy similar to pearl.
This is my desk.
What kind of problems do you have?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
I bought a car for 10% off.
Everyone laughed.
Stop that!
I'm lying.
Tom's in a meeting.
Don't argue.
Just be careful, Tom.
It's amazing!
I was at school.
I'll understand.
I'm in better shape than you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He gave up.
Maybe they're around the pond somewhere.
Everyone was looking for Tom.
I wish I'd known.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's out of shape.
I don't have enough time to explain it to you in detail.
Ivan's a nutter.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
I'll call her tonight.
He went for a walk.
Tom finally realized that Mary was right.
It's been a crazy year.
Forget it, Tom.
It is impossible to say with certainty.
Tom had never left his home before.
You owe me big time.
I'm not burning Turkish.
It's like summer out there.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
They're waiting for us.
What's your story?
Begin.
You have no idea how right you are.
I've been looking for you.
It'll take forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
I forgot.
This knife is not sharp.
Just close your eyes.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom could speak French.
Everyone is the boss in their own home.
These are my best friends.
I swim in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Let's take some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
What school did you go to?
The clouds are getting darker.
He's gentle by nature.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.
As long as we live, our heart never stops beating.
>>srp_Latn<< One senator called the president of another country, an old intelligence officer who would like to restore that country's old empire.
Would you like some more tea?
The nail punctured the tire.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stand there.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You always sing.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
I live in Istanbul.
Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
I wouldn't hurt them.
Tom was so cold his teeth were chattering.
What's your name?
Where's your dog?
This is the beginning of a new era.
Sami was Layla's dance partner.
A little birdie told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
Without a doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
It was love at first sight.
Stop.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom is still frustrated.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Tom made it clear he wasn't going to do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are types of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but in the long run even the best teacher gets angry if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There is no violence in this city.
They already have one.
There's really no need to do that.
Is your watch accurate?
Hopefully it will be dry weather.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches the next day?
>>srp_Cyrl<< At least 50 passengers have died.
It wasn't my fault.
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind that door.
I know everything.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Let's see you, Tom.
There is no rule without exception.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
The first thing my mother said to me was, "Are you crazy?"
I’ve read about 100 books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never been camping.
I'm only listening to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
On what basis do we know that he is innocent?
Did you do the dishes?
>>srp_Latn<< When he returned from duty in Afghanistan, Tom was haunted by nightmares.
I've made my decision.
My hands are cold.
Thank you so much!
>>srp_Cyrl<< The best lecture you can attend is the one you don't understand.
It won't have any effect.
Don't bleat.
Do you have the right one?
I need your help.
Don't you like swimming?
I'm a responsible person.
We have wine.
I wrote his number down on a piece of paper.
Add more water.
How was your day?
What Tom's proposing could save us all a lot of time.
Italy is a peninsula.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy right now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
That's his car.
Sure!
>>srp_Latn<< Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
Everyone else did.
Sign here.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what it is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
This is my wife, Edith.
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Either way, you're wrong.
It’s hard to give up long-term love at once.
Tom loves extreme sports.
A strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I have a white horse.
Good luck!
Let's talk about this over lunch.
Where did you get that idea?
Say hello to your friends.
That company is on shaky feet because of bad debts.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom said Mary was driving the car.
Tom hates strangers.
Fuck you!
We must respect our personal rights.
What is that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anyone want to go to Disneyland with me?
Why is train photography so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
It was a ridiculous mistake.
What are you eating, anyway?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't run before the ore!
I feel safe with you.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom tried to convince Mary not to, but failed.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslav.
There's got to be a better way to do this.
It didn't matter to me.
Love me tomorrow!
It's too noisy for me here.
Tom must have been trying to clean this without soap.
It was raining so hard that we decided to visit the other day.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Merry Christmas!
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
>>srp_Latn<< His unkindness angered her.
She rejected my proposal.
Trains in Serbia are very slow.
In that case, let's go.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but did not send it to her.
Gymnastics is his strong point.
He has a good memory.
Tom was fired.
The limbs are numb from the cold.
Tom's not very nice.
He is a hero to a hero.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're being honest.
Come play with us.
You know Tom ever lied?
Mary is Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
I'm proud of you.
I saw Marcus' house.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy right now.
Who is this man?
Here's some good news.
Refugees are welcome.
Many economists ignore this fact.
I am proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
>>bos_Latn<< There was a list of available candidates.
How deep is this lake?
What year is your car?
What's your name?
You have three cats.
Tom never said anything about that.
You're too young.
Don't stretch out.
Tom never asked why.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We have no such example.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
I know who killed him.
Did I ask you?
You can't touch it.
I've seen enough so far.
Turn around!
Be nice.
What am I supposed to see?
It stinks.
It took four kilos of gold to win the gold medal.
I'll have dinner at seven.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to add numbers to his head.
Take care of me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to believe me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man in question?
Will you talk to Tom for me?
I bought this yesterday.
How do you say "cat" in Spanish?
We have to act now.
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
I haven't seen him in a while.
We're here to play golf.
I haven't seen her in a while.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't shout.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is hard.
Save your energy, you'll need it later.
This has been a pleasant experience.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income is down 10 percent.
You'll see her.
It can be hard to get around unfamiliar terrain.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Oh, it's a grilled cheese.
Okay, you don't have that.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After much consideration, I ended up making things at random.
That's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
They were walking along the beach.
We're shrinking.
Can you talk to me?
Turn the TV down.
In the summer, I wear short-sleeved shirts.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me poems he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's the Avis counter?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't be a road bully.
Tom could tell us how to do that.
I was just leaving.
Tell him I'm innocent.
She spends three dollars a day on lunch and dinner.
See you in your dreams.
Come on in here.
I'm going home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid for that.
I've seen enough so far.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
The lawyer's job is to prove her client's innocence.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
>>bos_Latn<< If there is no porn with it, porn will be made with it.
Canada is the mother country of ice hockey.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom's saving up so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
How about you?
This is, without a doubt, a very uncomfortable situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She jogs every morning before breakfast.
This road leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
I burned my tongue.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a big fight.
What has science ever done for us?
Stop watching TV and start studying.
Turn left.
We don't know our neighbors.
You'll find the book in the library.
The police found the stolen money.
I've never seen that before.
I got here a few minutes before you did.
Fantastic!
I didn't do it either.
How much does a bottle of beer cost?
Where's Tony?
I'd like to talk to Tony.
I'll be back later.
You smell nice.
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to kiss Maria.
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
It's a table.
Flowers are blooming.
That's too bad.
His brother is a very capable doctor.
I'm done arguing.
I've got plenty of room.
What are you going to do today?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Don't shout.
I can't stop thinking about the stolen money.
That's your train.
Come and see us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A young man is often thoughtless.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
Let's get something to eat.
You think so?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Can we agree to disagree?
I try to be careful.
Always trouble when it comes to my kid.
Not yet.
One day she wants to study abroad.
Check this out.
Come quick!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
You're absolutely right.
I do not know.
I'm convinced.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Add more water!
Music is important to me.
I've been working on it day after day.
Do you have a favorite?
Please, come.
Take it easy!
No one has a soul.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Where there's grass, there's no water, where there's water, there's no grass.
My friend got 95 on her math test.
He did not allow anyone else into the room.
Better by grace than by force.
I have a lot to do today.
You're in trouble.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
There is no such thing as “freedom” in the Russian language.
I thought you'd be busy.
It's great.
Could that be true?
Keep it down, Tom.
That bag is mine.
Tom left before I got here.
Tell us a ghost story!
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
I want to live in the city.
What are you going to do this summer?
I tried to stop doing a lot of things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
Your wish is my command.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is Mary's grandfather.
Ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
She was educated in the United States.
Tell me what I have to do.
Open your mouth!
I wasn't told anything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The fire spread to an adjacent building before firefighters arrived.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary did.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad weather prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that one's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know a gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
>>bos_Latn<< It is one of the largest summer music festivals.
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
Shut your mouth and sit down.
What's this?
He took his clothes off.
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
He's American.
Tom only talks to Mary.
Without any doubt.
The first lesson is easy.
You've put on a lot of weight.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
We're brother and sister.
I can do a lot of things at the same time.
No one is as fast as you.
I agreed to buy that.
She's in a bad mood.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Let your imagination at will.
How about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go in that room.
What have you done to me?
It's all here.
Why me?
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you do, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You are a salve for the soul.
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered in your foolish business.
The light is gone by itself.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ask the policeman!
>>srp_Cyrl<< We have five fingers on each hand.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving up to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
What does the newspaper say?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Repairs were completed on the system after three years of volunteer work.
I need your signature.
She called me very late last night.
I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
Naoko lives in a white house.
>>srp_Latn<< The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective road link to Oslo and East Norway for the entire western region.
You let me down.
Hello, how are you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< She received four e-mails.
I'm really happy about it.
Tom suspects Mary and I are up to something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I just won't do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It is their right to vote.
It's hard to put into words what I think.
Tell me where you are.
Will we see Tom again?
Turn right at the next corner.
My mother cooks for me.
I try to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I was listening to music.
Are you involved in this?
Do you know why I'm here?
I hope he doesn't notice my mistake.
I must have eaten something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Tom can't swim like he used to.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Both answers are possible.
Tom works too hard.
>>srp_Latn<< Avoid addicts on paint thinner.
I liked that one.
He did not hide his disappointment.
The boy has a horse.
Do you like roller coasters?
We're out of food.
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
It's a nice time today.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Proletarians of all countries, unite!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom was unable to attend the meeting because he was ill.
Tell me why you did it.
Italy is in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
You have the right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You have to work harder.
Why are you being so paranoid?
Tom was running around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She wonders how that's possible.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Santa lives on the North Pole.
He was born in Ohio.
Please go.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose the pretty one.
Look at the size of it!
I tried to be nice.
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have difficulty talking about my feelings.
I'll give you anything you want.
It's their book.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom will arrive.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
She can't be bribed.
Will you turn off the light?
I'll save you.
I'll keep you posted.
>>bos_Latn<< We can watch Tom in a suit, after a black grand piano with dramatic finger strokes, creating music that is very enjoyable to listen to.
The strong winds broke many branches from the trees last night.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We need to prepare the ground for negotiations.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
They laughed at his mistake.
>>srp_Latn<< The path to the male heart leads across the stomach.
Every ship needs a captain.
It's time to get up.
>>bos_Latn<< The house was built of brick.
I didn't write this.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I can't help feeling partly responsible.
People have been good to me.
I know this is weird.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried it?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dr Jackson has a good relationship with the patient.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Are you a student?
Can I get a scratch for a cigarette?
I could come with you.
Have some.
Come inside.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
How many covers are on the bed?
There's really no need to do that.
Why are you so smart?
I'm cooking lunch.
I wonder what Tom's planning to do.
I'm fat.
>>srp_Latn<< In order to join the choir, you need to be able to read notes.
Tom dozed off.
They wanted an apology.
What did I do wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
You're not finished yet?
You're very rude.
He makes good money.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for a human being to always give himself priority over the interests of others.
I eat here.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
He was named captain of the football team.
What are you still doing up?
I was at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
A dull, insensitive child can sometimes grow up to be a sociopath.
I'd like him to stay with you.
It's the police's job to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you hand me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We all work too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom learns very quickly.
You're different.
She's unfamiliar with other people's hatred.
This will make our job a lot easier.
He loves football.
What time can you be here?
The monks could play tennis in the monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I wondered if I might be dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
The game can be postponed until next week.
I have a soul.
Driving to work takes an hour and a half.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm a natural.
I turned around.
I completely forgot to do it.
Marriage is the main cause of divorce.
He's here.
I'll make something up.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
You drink coffee?
Some of us feel that such views are pure madness.
It works.
Someone could get hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary while he was gone.
We've had enough of you.
You won't be able to handle this job.
We all know Tom did it.
She's Chinese.
I don't feel like drinking vodka.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
He needs her.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom got the worst of it.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
I'm more worried about you than the future of Japan.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a little nauseous.
Is this the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's OK.
I've read about 100 books so far.
I've made it to the skin.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great difficulty.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Few people know it exists.
Did you get the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on my math test.
The worst headaches are caused by poorly understood ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Investigate this.
What's your name?
They try.
My future is in your hands.
It's a fake, isn't it?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is cold-blooded.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
Can you tell the difference between silver and tin?
Hands up!
I don't exercise as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone either.
I think that's really important.
She doesn't speak English, let alone French.
It's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
In short, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
She's a teacher.
Without water it is impossible to live.
I played the piano a long time ago, so I can still do a little.
Is this your cup or your sister's?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter have represented two generations.
We're finally here!
He's in good hands.
He told himself he had to work in the garden two hours a day.
>>bos_Latn<< Apples and pears are donated, not gold and green forests.
Resting my legs.
The professor's statement is almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like to exercise.
Love you!
I'm really proud of it.
We were in last place.
I contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
I can read German, but I can't speak it.
That's not like you.
She achieved her goal.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
The madness has crossed the line.
Isn't that black?
This is not a children's book.
You're absolutely right.
Come, sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
Like I don't know!
Let's not talk about this right now.
Have fun.
Time to split up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
The briefing report is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you eating, anyway?
I don't like to be judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man hopes as long as he lives.
Be careful.
Let's discuss the options.
Don't worry, if you help me, everything will be fine.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I was buzzing with wonder.
That was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate that.

Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll feel better in a few days.
That's what Tom would want us to do.
He tried to kill himself.
Tom said to ask you.
Everyone knows that.
She enjoyed yesterday's party.
Just tell me the truth.
The birds sing.
Be careful: we write nationalities, days of the week and languages in capital letters in English.
I love watching you work.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Birds fly.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not bitter at all.
As far as we know, it's Tom's fault.
Love you.
Tom is a bookworm.
I changed my mind.
The problem is it's too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thinking beings, if only they could get that chance.
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Did Tom pull a fat end?
>>srp_Cyrl<< I am not afraid of death, but of dying.
We like him.
That's a good answer.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
I don't need anything.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
He was running.
It's not the right thing to do.
Please write down everything I say.
Without pain there is no science.
I wish you could sleep over.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I'm mad at you.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.
I assumed you were busy.
He is not a scientist, but he is our friend.
I hear Tom's interested.
We need to move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like to eat garlic in the morning.
I think Tom is very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
Fish, please.
I think I'm fat.
I think we got lucky.
Don't talk.
Do you teach French at your school?
Come have a drink with me.
If I could understand, I would tell you so.
You're running.
I took the first step.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
>>bos_Latn<< They were evacuated to the American Field Hospital.
We'll run in the park.
How far is it from here?
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about it.
Could you read it?
Will you dance with me?
We have to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
We need more flour.
Tell me what he says here.
>>bos_Latn<< Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I'm staying.
His way of speaking annoys me.
I never thought of it that way.
I know Tom let you down.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He is eternally dissatisfied.
Tom was badly injured.
My shirt isn't dry yet.
If you need help, let me know.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
First one leaves at 5:30 and arrives at 8:25.
That was kind of weird.
Plants grow.
Does he read and write Japanese?
Tom put the card on the table.
I called him.
It was just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
Mom, I'm hungry.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked my bike.
And now a word from our sponsor.
I am not at all satisfied with the situation.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
Stay calm.
I'm armed.
Tom can't help it.
Our eyes can't see infrared rays.
Time for bed.
Tom is very intelligent.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Can I replace this?
Tom wanted to have a nicer cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring the hair dryer?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know why.
How are you feeling?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Everyone tells me I'm weird.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you can think of can help.
Many predictions do not come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I feel bitter.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Did you return the book to the library?
Fadil wanted to steal Dani's money.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows all about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man of many talents.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Tom was Mary's first love.
>>srp_Latn<< The proposal was carried out by a hand-raising vote.
>>bos_Latn<< He often quotes Shakespeare.
Keep listening.
Tom may have to stay here for a few days.
We know her.
My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
>>bos_Latn<< The accident occurred on Sunday around 3:00 p.m.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
It doesn't affect him at all.
I thought the food was great.
Fifty families live in this small village.
Tom is an activist in his community.
I'm deaf and dumb when I eat.
You look fat.
Learning a language is not easy.
Do you have a headache?
You have to learn English step by step.
Tom is better off now than he was before.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom and Mary are as different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to be fulfilled and it would be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of such desires is the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, one would become completely sick of eternal life, and would long for death.
Water is a liquid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car by myself.
She takes care of her old mother.
Italy is far from Brazil.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
My wife's father is my father-in-law.
I want to live in the city.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together
>>srp_Cyrl<< I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
The news has arrived.
No one really wants us.
They all paid.
Be careful.
Yogurt is made from milk and cream.
I'm alone.
How about you?
Do not drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
That was just the beginning.
The book was sold out.
The price of gold changes every day.
Be nice.
Look around!
Tom got married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He's a scientist.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is train photography so interesting?
I hope you like it.
Welcome back.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a slob.
We can't go back.
I'll take a shower.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Could anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
It's none of our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why do you ask?
I saw Marcus' house.
At least he's honest.
It really is pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
You too, Brutus?
The house where Ataturk is born was in Thessaloniki.
People make mistakes.
It's snowing.
I thought you needed help.
Does this make sense?
I like your glasses.
He was elected president.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
I know your name.
Let's hear your excuse.
Dad said no.
They formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom was jumping up and down.
Tom's dog has gone to bed.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
You taught us that.
No, no.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not gonna leave me, are you?
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project.
You're texting Mary?
I'll save you a front row seat.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary pushes her children to play football.
Are they here yet?
Don't forget to give me back my pen.
Small flowers bloom at night.
I counted to two hundred.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One day you should try it.
I'll stay home with my grandparents for the weekend.
What did you conclude?
I've been praying for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on edge.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Tomorrow's Christmas.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
Tom reads a lot.
It's only a few minutes away.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work at the hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You are average students.
>>srp_Latn<< In childhood, many violent criminals ruthlessly tortured animals.
I'm going to live in Cambodia.
How long are you gonna stay mad and yell at us?
Please stop here.
How much does it really matter?
Shall we have an aperitif?
Tom complains all the time.
If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
I'm used to it.
It's not that bad.
It seems she was offended by what he said to her.
I love playing music written by my friends.
Tom admitted it.
I've been there twice.
Actions speak louder than words.
Is this where Tom sits?
Enough!
It's hard working with you.
Tom's put on weight.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Guilty as charged.
Don't answer that.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the photos!
It takes a few old houses to break down.
What have you been doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
I'm so tired, I can't learn.
I've never seen his face.
Tom's very considerate.
When will you go?
This report wasn't written very well.
I want a new bike.
She said the latest move by the government has multiple meanings.
They say love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer me.
>>bos_Latn<< The five brothers worked together on the farm.
It could be a trick.
The company is known for its high quality products.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom did not attempt to deny Mary's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
Thank you for accepting my Facebook friend request.
His hair covered almost all of his face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll make it up to you.
Why is he here?
>>bos_Latn<< One student from Oslo who forged his degree to enroll in college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Tom made some vegetarian chili.
I was trying to help you.
You've been really good to me.
I'll finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not the essay itself that's the problem, it's all these pernicious questions and explanations of words that are driving me terribly crazy!
It's the weekend.
I'll be back next week.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I really want to see her.
It was a stroke of luck.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He started yelling.
I'll be there when I finish my homework.
Clean up a little.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people love chicken.
Is Tom crazy?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's have another look.
The last time I went to the beach, I burned to death.
Pull back.
>>bos_Latn<< The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We fixed some damage caused by the stones spraying on your car.
I became a pensioner after forty-five years in the office.
Why are you suddenly curious?
His wife did not offer support.
I just took a bath.
Do you suspect me?
Fortunately, Tom did not get seriously injured.
In general, children love sweets.
Tom is going to cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
Tom decided to take the day off.
How could I resist?
Gold is much heavier than water.
The phone is a wonderful device.
Tom is afraid of death.
I can't fix the car by myself.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
Let's not get into that.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
This is my question.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely got the worst of it.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
There's no match for him.
There's nothing wrong with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve. Then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; therefore, it is time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
Tom won't run away.
I'd go.
I don't take bribes.
Down!
Tom couldn't take it.
Anything you can think of can help.
You will feel better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the eye of the likes of you, but this is just pathetic.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
And what if I'm gay?
Either way, he will surely come.
Please keep this place as clean as you would like to find it.
We'll get through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
There's only so much we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's your life.
What's your name?
I understand.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I feel like crying.
I sympathize.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He'll be finished soon.
You learn by doing.
You'll never walk alone.
It's Tom you want.
The police are after me.
Did you see anyone there?
Either way, you're wrong.
They won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
Nobody said anything.
The book's on the table.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He is a true aristocrat.
I'm doing my job.
It's quiet again.
I failed.
We know.
Tom goes to graphic design school.
He lied to you.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
Music is his passion.
>>bos_Latn<< You should face reality.
Light waves pass through space and different materials.
We managed to escape just in time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Carthage must be destroyed!
How much does it cost?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
It should work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm not opposed to your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Have some.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I'm getting hungry from all this running.
I'm a translator.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was hot in every sense of the word.
The spider tickles me.
Talk about others like they'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
Seems okay to me.
Whatever do you think?
You changed my life.
We'll get through the jungle somehow.
Reaction is not always the best way to act.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to drive him to the airport.
>>srp_Latn<< The committee recommends that those who complained should be reimbursed with a proportional portion of the annual fee with interest.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
That's my money, too.
It was, it was over.
Tom's distracted.
>>srp_Latn<< Remember the filenames before trying to perform the return of deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only vodka from Russia is real Russian vodka!
I didn't get nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
A lot of things work out for me.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
Tom's always been a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
How long do you think Tom was getting ready for the exam?
A book that describes the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to throw stones in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He exhaled.
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
You can't touch that.
Don't split hairs.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
Mary is a retired nurse.
I probably won't be watching TV tonight.
Did Tom get the long end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
Those are nice shoes.
The girl sees the boy.
We also call Robert "Bob."
It is very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
They're teachers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The government fell after a vote in parliament.
You're not funny.
Tom went instead of Mary.
The notebook's not yours, it's his.
It happened right here.
He was driving the car down the street.
I don't know Latin very well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.
I'm waiting on my turn.
That's not the main question.
I was very shaken by the news.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The girl eats bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you prefer tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not like that.
They know you.
I passed every test.
What are you going to do today?
What's on your mind?
I'll kill you!
>>srp_Cyrl<< I was as cold as a spritzer.
There is no point in waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
It snowed yesterday.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I wrote this song just for you.
My house, my freedom.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
Even if I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it!
We studied all afternoon.
Are you going to send this as a mail order?
What do you suggest?
It is said that love is blind.
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch it!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
Slowly they moved forward.
Why is love so hard?
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
I'm too late, aren't I?
Don't stare.
It's blue on you.
Come visit us soon.
Have you been in an accident?
What are you and Tom doing?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
I don't know if I'll have time.
I went there voluntarily.
We're all out of alcohol.
Ticket, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
Why are we laughing?
My friend lives in the middle of nowhere.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
She shouted at him, but he didn’t hear her.
Water is life.
What are you gonna do today?
He will likely win the championship.
After silence, what most accurately expresses the unspeakable is music.
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
It's not over until it's over.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have that kind of trouble.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a busy day ahead of you.
That's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully served.
Tom and Mary would make a wonderful couple.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Don't work too hard!
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always act rationally.
I didn't do that either.
Did you pass your exams?
We'll have to walk now.
I'll set you free.
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< How about we build a group on Facebook so we can discuss learning foreign languages?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Do we agree?
It's not that bad.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Stop smoking.
Tom went that way.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
But why?
Can I see your ticket?
What happens now?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
They've rigged the library with new books.
It's clear.
>>srp_Cyrl<< How about some chocolate cheese?
Today is your daughter's birthday.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typo.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like to be.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a nice garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It's pointless to be idle during your student life.
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got naughty hair.
I've seen enough so far.
I hate that one.
We'll miss you very much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom will take a look.
Tom was eating a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I want to go.
I could come with you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cost of living is rising.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you disarm the bomb?
I think Tom could do it.
I need five more minutes.
He sleeps like a baby.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many songs have you written?
Where's your head?
We're glad to have you here.
You can write in any language. In Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
How do we manage others when we can’t manage ourselves?
Don't rush it.
She's Thai.
You can learn, regardless of age.
He dedicated his life to achieving a vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who have you helped recently?
Just close your eyes.
She doesn't like football.
Tom's a little worried.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is the best student in the class.
How is this your fault?
My phone number is 9876-5432.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
How did I overlook this?
This is a sentence.
Life is sweet.
That's my cat.
What should I write here?
I'm deeply ashamed.
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptable.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
I don't know who they are.
He's fixing electronic devices.
Sing, please.
You lose.
I'm ready, bro.
Please kick as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Pass the sugar, please.
It’s nice to be needed by someone.
I hope we can figure this out.
We all have to stand up to this.
Where's the toothpaste?
Mrs. Klein is in her 80s, but she's still very active.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
Trust me.
This is my computer.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
We know enough.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired, I can barely keep my eyes open.
Gardening is fun.
It’s never too late to learn.
Throw me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever posted a video on YouTube?
>>bos_Latn<< I was very interested in participating in building a more intensive academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Tom gave me a few books.
Don't let Tom know that.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
How much is this umbrella?
I'm so into her.
Tom did his homework in the kitchen.
I could kill you right now.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary used walking sticks that helped her on the ups and downs of her journey.
Suck my dick.
The compass points north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
On whose initiative was this done?
Finish this.
Which one should I take?
I love cable dishes.
Where's your friend?
When do we start eating?
>>bos_Latn<< The Queen and King reunited their powers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This takes forever.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I suppose you already know the answer to that.
The flowers are completely gone.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book the least.
Blue looks good on you.
How did you do this?
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said he'd be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother, John.
I'd take it.
Humans are complicated organisms.
They'll know what to do.
Why were you silent all the time?
He's undressed.
Sami saw Leila's reaction
I have a laptop.
Can I ask you a favor?
He got away.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I've dislocated my right shoulder.
Drop dead!
You really need to take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
I don't want to work under those conditions.
>>bos_Latn<< Mayuko avoided hard work.
She has short hair.
Drive slow.
My right hand is numb.
I know almost nothing about you.
Did you do something?
You taught us that.
You can't talk to her.
You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy Mother's Day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
Everyone appreciates Henry.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
A little bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
I feel safe with you.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
The Chairman opened the meeting.
It just wasn't our day.
It was raining.
Take it all.
I wish there was a God.
I resigned.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.
>>srp_Latn<< Marriage between persons of the same sex is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland as of yesterday.
Take this home with you.
She bought bread.
We'll try it your way.
Help yourself.
You deserve my congratulations.
I miss you so much.
Since the message was in French, I could easily read it.
This might hurt a little.
They can speak a little Spanish.
Finish this.
Tom tried to talk Mary out of it.
Could you pass the water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more diligently.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
Is the world unfair?
None of us saw Tom do that.
Do you love your mother?
I'm Tom's grandfather.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
The more I know people, the more I admire dogs.
You spelled my name wrong.
You're different.
Tom can't stay.
You're embarrassing her.
I have two cats.
There were about a thousand people.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend was not supportive.
I had dinner with him.
I wasn't interested in that.
>>srp_Latn<< Some of them were and still are in constant danger due to political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I don’t think the internet is a place for children.
It's been hard on me.
My teacher gave me the longest chapter.
What did you figure out?
You were made for me.
He needs her.
It's obviously a typo.
Are we done?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Am I seeing things?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a stickler.
Control yourselves.
I'm tired, but I'm fine.
Butter is made of milk.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things will happen.
You're wrong.
Several trees fell during a storm in our area.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
They all smiled.
I didn't know you were so rich.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a single word.
Do you have trouble understanding what women or young children tell you?
Cathy seems to like music.
He refused to comment.
Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove that?
We're trying.
I'm out.
You disappoint me.
Tom looked angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
Excuse me.
I wasn't home all day yesterday.
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay until tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He's everything, just not fair.
The bullet pierced the helmet.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing is going very well.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Show me the photos!
That helps us a lot.
I filled the glass.
I'm not picky.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
That morning, Mary visited the whole village.
The rumor spread quickly.
Am I that different?
Tom took the keys out and opened the door.
Heather trusts me.
I just got here.
I played with Tony yesterday.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I know him well.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Without tools there is no craft.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It helps.
Dima slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This is making me very uncomfortable.
We're from Russia.
Costs will soon rise.
I work in a language school.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
It's always been that way.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Deaf people can talk in sign language.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Jane lies sick in bed.
I'm warning you!
Tom will call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Do they suspect me?
What do you have to do?
Cows give milk.
Tom likes to drive.
I've been looking for you.
I'm a woman.
It's all important.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
The whole country is talking about it!
The winter is over. Spring has come.
Which way are you going?
It really is that simple.
With such a price, your product will not survive the competition in the Japanese market.
I met your dad yesterday.
Since those papers were about no farmer wanting to work as a tenant in Westfold, interest grew rapidly.
I'm grounded.
I have to go inside.
We're a little busy here.
All aboard.
Good luck with your work!
It's really surprising.
Have you ever seen a UFO?
You're standing on my aisle.
It got dark.
What's the big secret?
The police are after me.
I took the first step.
Elbrus is the highest mountain in Europe.
I hope Tom remembers this.
We ask the teacher questions every day.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
I'm not free today.
If the world wasn't in the way it is now, I could trust anyone.
>>srp_Latn<< Three of the wounded, for which it is currently unclear what condition they are in, have been evacuated to the U.S. Field Hospital.
I prayed for you.
When was this book published?
Ethereum and Bitcoin are cryptocurrencies.
Hello, can you hear me?
We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Every time I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, folks?
Will you help me?
It didn't get that bad.
>>srp_Cyrl<< And they lived happily ever after.
Tom is blushing.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see it work?
Is that a yes or a no?
I'm going to marry a beautiful Estonian woman.
My car's in the garage.
Give me another example.
Who sent me a telegram?
His condition has improved.
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
He doesn't know where he's supposed to be.
I'm in a hurry.
We're done for the day.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, there is a general precaution to avoid infections in this type of patients.
I'm a free man.
I don't like bigoted people.
I won't say anything.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
It could be a weapon.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Put the book on the top shelf.
He's sleepy.
I can't fix the car on my own.
I'd better go with Tom.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips burst into a sinister smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary's enthusiasm for the course declined when her favorite lecturer moved away.
I don't want to be rude.
Mary wasn't worthy of your trust.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
Tom was nervous as he started a new job.
When do you usually get up?
Help me.
The United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.
Are you reading something interesting?
You can't smoke here, you can't have your cancer anywhere else.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Simplicity is the pinnacle of refinement.
What does he live on?
I assumed you were busy.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
Call Tom.
Tom is always very nice.
I barely slept a wink.
What would I do without you?
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really that happy?
I took off my wig.
I have no one but her.
You're reckless.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom is named after his father.
That's new.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm going to take a nap.
What was I supposed to do?
Stay away from my wife.
They will know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend, I was just pretending.
Did I drop that?
Please, sit down.
I just want to get out of here.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
Why do you think that?
I am death.
Little kids like to touch everything.
She curled her hair with papillotams.
He was released from military service.
My gums are bleeding.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which one of your friends is coming?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
They work together.
You tried.
The toy store is closed.
I'm taking you dancing.
I'm a student.
This is my e-mail address.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do it.
She's making a mosquito out of an elephant.
You told me not to lie.
He used to be a member of the social elite, rather than a representative of the broad masses.
I'm terrified.
You tried.
His opinion is reasonable.
Help us to reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
Can you read that sign in front of us?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Take your time.
Give me a pen.
Your answer is incorrect.
Just tell Tom I called.
There is no answer to the question of what is best, because it is always individual and depends on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'll probably never use this again.
I don't have a ticket.
- Hey!
He's American.
You seem like a very smart person.
It's amazing.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year for training.
There's a cup of tea and an egg on the table.
>>bos_Latn<< The house burned to the ground before firefighters arrived.
You should have told Tom.
The months with the most rain are May, June, July and August.
Do I usually look happy?
Tom lives in Paris.
I've already written part of the report.
You're human.
I was ready for it.
Show me the documents.
It has something to do with...
It can be hard to do with passion, maybe it's just sex.
Are you done doing the dishes?
I pulled an ace.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
Tom will pay.
Tom lost his job.
Hunting season is over.
I love the Kabyle cuisine.
I'll start with the beer.
Oh, thank God.
Did Tom give it to you?
She's spending the holidays at her uncle's.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
The ladies have an advantage.
I'm motivated.
What's your name?
What a tragedy!
We're here.
It's mine, not his.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I'm almost never home during the day.
I live in Chile.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their innate talents.
I'd go.
You're very rude.
You let me down.
There's snow all year round on this mountain.
I don't think you should rush into anything these past few days.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Today is your daughter's birthday.
What's in nature forever, when everything is so fleeting?
He's American.
The engine's overheating.
I'll see you later!
>>srp_Cyrl<< The wind blows like a silly.
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
I'll take the car to town, so I can drop you off on the way.
This might not be enough.
Party's at Tom's house tonight.
You got that right.
Why do you need so many shoes?
Everything you have will one day have you.
No matter how busy Tom is, he never forgets to email his shirt at least once a week.
They may need a little money.
The dog is dead.
This is life.
The situation is urgent.
They had a fight.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He who wounds early, two fortune grabs.
Do we have one of those?
Is this your suitcase?
They are Spanish villages to me.
This town isn't big enough for the two of us.
Tom stopped for a second.
Due to bad weather, the plane was delayed.
Investigate them.
I'm in better shape than you are.
I'm not that worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Better a sparrow in the hand, than a pigeon on a branch.
Do you have time to have lunch with me?
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I think it's possible to do that.
Tom doesn't think I know what he said.
I'm going to take a nap in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
It's as hot today as it was yesterday.
>>srp_Latn<< He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test, before being sent for laboratory testing.
We walked in the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
Come to my house.
It's been a stressful day.
Her name is Lucifer.
Don't move!
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom watched closely.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
What is your job?
Let's continue the discussion.
How much do I get?
Who in the family wears pants?
What the fuck?
Tom's undercover.
I want to be with you.
Infidels ridiculed the bishop's interpretation.
This was refined and embodied in a personality so strange, rigid and stubborn that few dared to work closely with it.
She's pregnant.
Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited.
Don't move!
Hurry.
I could be there by 2:30.
Have fun while you can.
Merauke is the easternmost city of Indonesia.
Tom used to come here a lot as a student.
We'll take the next one.
>>bos_Latn<< He keeps his youth running.
If you act like a fool, you'll be treated like one.
Did you do your homework?
Check everyone.
Tell us a ghost story.
I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
Check everyone.
I was sick and had to stay home.
Session's over.
I baked bread.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We have to follow Tom.
Why are you acting like a child?
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
What's the Wi-Fi code?
I'm pathetic.
I can't wait until Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
He's Chinese.
>>bos_Latn<< Cut the cheese into thin slices or into small cubes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stop worrying.
We'll have to wait and see.
Have you ever been in a car accident?
I'd like to get started.
I wasn't wearing intrusive clothes.
I'm fascinated.
I'm as hungry as a wolf.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence caused a real stir.
Give food to the homeless.
I translated the song as best I could.
He left a few minutes ago.
I believe you're being honest.
I don’t know why I pay more attention.
The university was founded by his father twenty years ago.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom has an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Even though I was sick, I did my best.
Big boys don't cry.
I could go there now.
Etherium and Bitcoin are cryptocurrencies.
Tom must have had a key.
I need to write 10 pages for next Monday.
She expects us to help her.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and consciousness, and should treat each other in a spirit of brotherhood.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It will last for an eternity.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I need to sleep.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom usually comes to school before any other student in the class.
I'm touched.
Even if I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Tom will help anyone who asks for help.
Why not?
"Where should I sit?" "Anywhere."
>>srp_Latn<< Wisdom is needed in order to understand: music does not exist for a deaf audience.
You didn't answer the question.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Troubled children are often without any sense of guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.
I invited him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom's blushing.
Tell him.
How to get rid of moles in the garden?
I love Korean food.
I have confidence in you.
It's Saturn.
Stop grumbling.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I can't sit still.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
We learn to read and write at school.
I don't like it when you work at home.
>>bos_Latn<< Tatoeba: Where attention is to the details of the world, and punishment is swift.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
How was your day?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is an ex-con.
Where are you now?
It is very likely that FIFA is rotten to the core.
She gave me a contradictory answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He wears a gold chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of it.
Ataturk was born in 1881 in Thessaloniki.
At least Tom's honest.
We've been taking care of you a lot.
The children were eager for attention.
It's hers, isn't it?
I want to answer the last question first.
Is this what you told Tom?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only 5:00 in the morning, and it's already light outside.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, a crossover with that will happen eventually.
Tom's a good Frenchman.
I couldn't help Tom do it.
Get out of here!
Tom nodded.
I know this is weird.
Please continue.
He never got over his son's death.
When are you leaving?
I'm just doing my duty.
Tom's gone to hell.
They all sat down.
>>bos_Latn<< If you have nothing else to do, then the number of the Greek Islands.
She always wears bright clothes.
Good always conquers evil.
Will that solve the problem soon?
I don't care what he says.
Mary put a ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom seemed older and more mature than the other boys.
He's American.
It'll take forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She smiled.
>>srp_Latn<< The devotees of Vishnu are called Vishnuans; the devotees of Shiva are Shivans.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown.
I completely lost track of my thoughts.
Two bags of cement will do.
I never regretted doing that.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Romani?
Tom came to see me yesterday at noon.
Hello, my friend!
Tom's still at work.
Did you get enough sleep last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all along.
>>srp_Latn<< "I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in the things people make I want to see scars, failure, disorder, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I turned Tom down.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
This child continued to cry for hours.
I'd buy that one.
This transcends all boundaries.
I have a headache today.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
I want to go.
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
French is his mother tongue.
Her words made him angry.
I laughed.
It wasn't too hot.
I'm completely penniless.
I almost forgot my passport.
I've been looking for you.
Tom reads a lot.
Enough!
I hope you're not talking about me.
He who wields the sword, by the sword and by the destruction.
You're good to everyone.
I'm not usually this busy on Mondays.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom looked very confused.
I'll be home tomorrow.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The teacher explained the meaning of the word to us.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
They did an unthinkable job.
He was drinking too much again.
Just tell Tom I called.
>>srp_Latn<< "If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "If not Q, then not P."
My wedding has to be perfect.
Move over.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She doesn't like being told what to do.
We should study.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When the willow gives birth to grapes!
We have no other choice.
When the weather is like this, it's best to sit at home and not go outside.
A man’s character is his destiny.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Play it again, Sam.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom made Mary do it.
Tom, I need your help.
I brought you some coffee.
During an experiment on the power of perception, Tom could not describe a single painting from the wall of his living room, even though he had lived there for two years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I've never seen Tom this busy.
Seems like you haven't been yourself lately.
It's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
I hope that's true.
I wonder whose sentence that is.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom was buying time.
Everyone held their breath.
Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't get the name.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
That's not funny at all.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
What did you like the most along the way?
I love watching you work.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom suggested that Mary go to the doctor.
We hope to visit Beijing.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
You're my inspiration.
This time I refrained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
There's a Mr. Itoh to see you.
Be careful.
She'll pay a maximum of $50.
Did someone call me?
We'll have lunch together at 1:30.
What's his name?
I'm still a little tired.
I think I'm gonna shit myself.
I'm a vegetarian.
The picture is in this book.
To strive to maximize one’s self-interest, happiness, or safety seems very natural to one human being.
I can do it as a joke.
I don't sing.
It's strange that no one knows the victim.
We're five minutes away.
I have a few gifts.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit that.
That was just the beginning.
Have you finished your homework?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Over the last few days I've done research regarding making money using the project, but I think all options will require a sudden change in my lifestyle, which is a tricky thing.
Is everything okay between us?
I've never been camping.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the rings on the tree that we knocked down and found that it was thirty years old.
I'll see you later, Tom.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Let's make an appointment.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect something else to happen?
Tom still seems shaken.
I'm a very sad man.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people will like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
I want to show you something.
Remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're afraid of me.
Yesterday I was happy.
You are my sun.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one helped us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
She divorced her husband.
I'm here.
I want to live in Brazil.
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
Mary is Tom's only daughter.
He still has no experience for this job.
Can you help us?
You want to chill?
>>srp_Latn<< Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
I changed my mind.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Based on the data I presented to you, what story would you go out with?
Who can't be proud to be a Serb, with their historic highest achievements - the massacre of chiefs and genocides?
That makes it more unique.
Do you know how to defuse a bomb?
Will you invite her to the party?
Where did I leave my keys?
I'm a big fan of football.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom lost his touch.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
He's not missing anything.
Tom will take a look.
I wonder if someone could help me. I have a cell phone that just shows an error message.
I'm surprised.
Everyone was smiling.
I miss him.
You should spend more time outside and less time inside.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom played on the strongest card.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He left his family and moved to Tahiti.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You underestimate me.
What is your favorite YouTube video?
Millie listens to music.
The sea is green.
I don't have a guitar.
Are you gonna turn me in?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
He called off the meeting at the last minute.
We're just getting started.
My friend can speak Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't it great?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Please, move away.
I like Tom, but he doesn't like me.
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written part of the report.
I just finished it.
We're talking about the wolf, and the wolf's at the door.
Don't stop.
Please come and see me tomorrow.
I get the impression he knows a secret.
It was kind of weird.
Tom won't pass the exam.
Will you do that for me?
I really enjoyed it.
No one's died... yet.
In my beginning is my end.
Can we humans digest grass and extract nutrients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
How would you translate that?
It's almost half past three.
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom was writing on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
Who is she?
I bought this yesterday.
The odds are against me.
I'll quit.
The kids are playing outside.

Do what you want, I don't care.
She expects us to help her.
Who are you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Call me any time I always have a shoulder to cry on.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstand me.
That's good.
I'm not gonna push you.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Thanks for coming!

Are we leaving soon?
I found him a book.

I think Tom's careful.
Oh, no!
I forgot the baby monitor.
Tom's upstairs.
He's kind.

This is the beginning of a new era.
Mary looks cute whatever she's wearing.
Shit happens.
Watch it!
>>srp_Latn<< Tom failed to present any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You don't even know his name, do you?
We don't have to look down on the poor.
You have a bad temper.
Is this your phone?
I was just leaving.
>>bos_Latn<< They separated after their wedding anniversary.
This house was built by a famous architect.
He took care of the baby.

Let's find out for sure.

We could be happy here.
He's very educated.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He's back on his toes again.
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Our yacht club has ten members.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
That lady and the man are holding hands, they're very good friends, aren't they?
Can I walk you home?
I just saw the Saudi ambassador resign.
Be careful.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I had trouble solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I have one brother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do it.
I have a few friends.
I have to look for her.
I can't wait.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
One moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom wants to know when you'll be done.
Call me back.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
>>srp_Latn<< "If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(Not P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came in a little earlier than usual today.
Do you believe in eternal life?
A horse could be eaten.
I've never actually met Tom.
Which is easier?
Tom demanded an increase.
Fadil wasn't in the house.
I've never noticed that before.
This is supposed to work.
Where have you been all afternoon?
What do you have to do?
I always liked Tom better.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
>>bos_Latn<< Tom bought the newspaper and read them on the train on his way to work.
I have house spirits.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.

Work slowly.
I didn't do that either.

Answer me now.
Make yourself at home!
The students did not know how to respond.
Did you know that before?
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I tripped.
I assumed you were busy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Who are you running from?
That elegant gilded chain of hearts is the necklace that will “shake your world.”
Your answer is correct.
I love Leanne.
It all happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It was raining hard.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take some more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.
Don't argue with me.

Check, please.
Broccoli is one of the healthiest types of vegetables.
I'm terrified.
I'm doing great.

Don't worry, I'll translate it for you.
What did I do wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I've missed so many opportunities.
We heard her crying.
It helped me a lot.
You don't have to yell, I'm not deaf!
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
We have no choice.
Baseball is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She is currently violent, she should be avoided.
I was just stalling.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
Tell him I'm innocent.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
I'll visit him in a few weeks.
Italy is not Greece.
It's for my friend.

Did you go to see Tom?
What's that?
He surrendered.
I can't wait forever.
This is the beginning of a new era.
America is one big, friendly dog in a small room, every time it wags its tail, it knocks down a chair.
I don't have a ticket.
The doctor works at the hospital.
Nothing happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You'll be famous.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Welcome to Tatoeb.
Everything's different.
What's your Bosnian name?
The truth must be told.
Look how big it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Is your car blue?
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
He lied to you.

I always eat fruits and oatmeal for breakfast.
Do you think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.

Dear God, it’s really hard for people when they have to call your attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes, or your appearance, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could do better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a great nothingness.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary in a long time.
This history tells us interesting facts.
"Yes, orange juice, please," Mike said.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I interrupt you for a second?
I hate science.

Do you have a book?
He has two cars.
If you don't bother them, they won't bother you.
Good intentions are important.
I've already thought about it.
Men remain children all their lives.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.

I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
Just looking around.
Where is the beach?
Do you want to know something specific?
Welcome aboard.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
>>srp_Latn<< Interability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I don't know.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students attended the meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He called off the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's good.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters consider Maria to be the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom will not vote in this election.
I bought flowers.
I'm sure you'll do fine.
She's back from the hospital.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What happens now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Make way.
Tom is also well known in Australia.
Someone called.
Be careful.
Winter is a time of snow.
Under what name?
>>srp_Cyrl<< What are you going to do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes, they might come true.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who will come with us?
Sounds like you learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
The way it came, the way it went.
Give him time.
Who waits, welcomes.
I'll have to say, yes.
We've never been apart.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor examined her thoroughly.
At that moment, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91% of the Norwegian population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What does she drink?
These are artificial tears.
Tom is very rude.
Don't forget to write the date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
Try again.
It's perfectly normal.
How's your life going?
>>bos_Latn<< A new restaurant is said to have been built.
The price of this book is $5.
I want a sword like this.
Can you keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Move quietly.
When the fire broke out, he was asleep.
My older sister sings well.
I never thought of that.
Her childhood illness blinded her.
Some friends can't be replaced.
While the existence of this phenomenon is mere speculation it is possible that there will be evidence to support it in the future.
Quiet down there.
Tom explained it in detail, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want to eat some cheese.
That wouldn't like it.
I will have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom double-parked.
Can you speak Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back.
What are you gonna do about Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to the protection of moral and material interests arising from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the creator.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands at sea.
I've never had any trouble falling asleep.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went for a walk.
Are there other options?
The amount for the work done and interest in the invested capital were several million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who's paying.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need something to drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't completely agree with you.
It's a beautiful day.
Are you saving this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think we women have an extra sense.
>>srp_Latn<< The week has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in the southeastern part of Europe.
I'll be back late.
You're a little liar.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
I will send a letter to my brother who lives in Sapporo.
>>bos_Latn<< The politician had sticky fingers, as 5% of each contract ended up in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought it was my job.
I'm a teacher.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no need to panic.
He didn't even hear what Tom hated about us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I sent anyone a letter.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
>>bos_Latn<< American English is no better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours a day.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'll take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, not his.
We have four French lessons every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
>>bos_Latn<< Fadil demanded that Daniya give him the money.
Alone is our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
He broke into my home.
The bathroom is upstairs.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It is a typical Gothic church.
It was a presentation that pleases the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Is this your notebook?
Somehow we survived.
Tom didn't exercise.
Thank you so much!
Keep the change.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom turn himself in?
>>srp_Latn<< Europeans gained an advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It seemed to me that Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to be doing.
I will pray for your family.
Tom chased the flies away.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He abruptly stopped smoking.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
>>bos_Latn<< Tom asks Mary to refute the saying.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There's a cup on the table.
It pisses me off a lot.
Is there still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
A lot of birds are on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Don't you agree?
Would you like me to take a look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very nice of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what's it to you?
I wish I'd thought of that.
I drink milk.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw a cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom comes back safely.
I have no idea what was going on in his head to refuse such a favorable suggestion.
I just got up.
How does it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go outside and take a walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Whoa!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom is strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate hot dogs with potato salad.
Come alone.
To be a good child, you need to go to bed and get up early.
How about you?
I'm thinking of going abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where you from?
I promised.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a layabout.
This is how it was supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom's a nerd.
>>srp_Latn<< The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, having become a victim of a conspiracy, he is convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
My French sucks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like to be.
It stinks.
Can you tell Tom I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Faith can move mountains.
One foot in the grave.
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bill is two years younger than me.
I'm sympathetic.
Tom is unhappy.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy as hell.
I'm sorry I didn't respond to your letter earlier.
Do not drink water from a dirty glass.
What do you know about me?
I've been reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me in the least.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I had slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's her picture.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Who's your favorite wrestler?
Nice to meet you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
This place looks a lot different than it used to be.
Is it yours?
Why Are Rabbit Ears Big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
There are no souls.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
I shot the bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without supper.
Tom's an idiot.
Yeah.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
It's very rare.
What did I just do?
It’s best to do things on the go.
You're working too hard.
This one's pretty cool.
Not a word.
I really enjoyed it.
That can be trusted to some extent.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Kedda.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
Sorry, I'm late for the session.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this band.
It's 5:00 in the morning in Brazil.
Tom hinted that Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's pretty cool.
Tom cut the tape.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom's been arrested three times.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary said she would reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they did not increase her salary.
This is not taught in school.
Is it clear?
I don't feel like going out tonight.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish can't live out of water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy I can't help you.
I have two flowers.
Move it!
Please wait a little longer.
I won't do it!
I'm tired of arguing.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
Well done!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could be a mess.
I just want to get out of the way.
>>bos_Latn<< Dania continued to follow Fadil's example.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day, Bill goes fishing.
Don't let a chance like this slip through your fingers.
What time do you have breakfast?
Be careful.
She's in her first year of college.
I looked for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you make Tom laugh?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Due to bad weather, the plane was delayed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Can I take your dictionary?
My fluent knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not for expressing my often contradictory emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a teacher.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a nerd.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a tremor in my heart.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
Show me the photos!
>>srp_Cyrl<< She fantasized about becoming a nurse.
I'm sorry to always bother you.
Tom's risking everything.
He is a man of power.
Great!
I'm ticklish.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it on time?
It's funny the mailman hasn't come yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How do we prevent that from happening?
>>bos_Latn<< His novels are a favorite among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'm about to buy a boat.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not American, he's English.
How do you say “thank you” in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
You ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a mechanic.
His misfortune has taught me so much.
Are we ready to go?
Why not?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and take a walk.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
>>srp_Latn<< Vivaldi has written many musical works for the bassoon.
>>srp_Latn<< United States Secretary of State John Kerry broke his right femur in a bicycle accident in France on Sunday.
Where there's a lot of midwives, there's a lot of kids.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom's tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
It sounds simple, I know.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was just whipped cream on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom looked very confused.
The results were incredible.
Pick one.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
The brakes are creaking.
Have you fully recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She's drinking like a schmuck.
Don't move!
>>bos_Latn<< The accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I drop that?
Are you happy?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I'd known Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by his looks.
It's useless.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
>>srp_Latn<< The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the left side is in New York City.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be somewhat more modest this year.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Italy is a beautiful country.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
>>srp_Latn<< Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Introduce me to Tom.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After a long consideration, I ended up making things at random.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who spares words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house for dinner yesterday.
Look at the size of it!
It's true.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy one.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom's out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have gotten involved with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I’ll write it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Termites eat wood.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
You failed me.
One should not judge a man by his appearance.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the email!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll give speeches tomorrow.
What's this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me too.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans then?
The kids are asleep.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many towns in England, has a rather long history.
Tom closed the door.
It wasn't fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and wasted a lot of money.
I don’t like to socialize.
Tom is alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
That smells delicious.
Phase one is complete.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She takes care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a dozen pens today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French taught at your school?
That can't be true.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Take a picture.
Who lives next door?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom will recover.
It is important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight ahead.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to nobody liking me.
The brakes squeaked.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Just like beans.
I'm a little worried right now.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
>>srp_Latn<< Tom still knows how to recite a song he wrote when he was thirteen.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you good money to do it.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
It was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
Hopefully tomorrow will be a good day.
Maria nodded.
Let's sit.
Come take a look.
Tom does look familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm out.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom saved all the letters Mary sent him.
Go swim with Tom.
It's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A woman's chiffon isn't complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the bathroom here?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Happy Easter!
Tom helped me save a few bucks by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
>>bos_Latn<< There is nothing to be done but to admire him for his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's worked his whole life.
Drop dead!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
My watch needs fixing.
Tom will live.
Please read between the lines.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'll be late.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I had a quick lunch.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
I need you to leave a message for Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
I want what you want.
Health is wealth.
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he was never on time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a rock.
Can I call you back in 20 minutes?
The wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
>>srp_Latn<< As little as we know about its origin, at least we can be sure it is the pilot of Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
The deer is faster than the stronger.
People used to write books with typewriters.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom sees nothing wrong in allowing Maria to learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope not.
Give me an example.
How could I hate Tom?
Take this away.
How barbaric!
What day is tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I look forward to your letter.
When the cat's gone, the mice are in the water.
We need that from Tom.
Japan is ruled by the Emperor and Spain by the King.
It's Ali's book.
Will we see Tom again?
The world was on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie drinks milk.
Where did you see Tom?
It's quiet again.
I'm engaged.
Can we order please?
What does he do?
By the way, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They laughed at me.
I'm angry.
Take it easy, Tom.
Can you give an example?
I don't intend to go to Bust with you this weekend.
He stole a very precious diamond ring.
That's my cat.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom drinks like a schmuck.
Just like the good old days.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
That's not like you.
He's always here between 5:00 and 6:00.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hope I can do that.
I don't like stubborn people.
Sitting around all day is bad for you.
The rainy season begins in June.
You always do.
It's perfectly normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.
The wall looked smooth and impenetrable.
Do you hear something?
He has two cars.
Tom will probably still be angry.
He greeted us and left.
Welcome to Tatoeba.
I look, but I can't see.
I'm bleeding.
I'm glad you answered.
We're close friends.
We can't be friends anymore.
In the future, many workers will be replaced by robots.
Thomas was completely drunk.
I admit I'm wrong.
That house belongs to him.
My father listens to classical music.
Who did?
How many people live on Earth?
I'm a little worried right now.
Come back anytime.
We're from Russia.
So be it.
What am I supposed to do my free time.
We have to keep working.
We had a terrible fight.
Who ate the last doughnut?
Are you free tonight?
If I love you, what's it to you?
You don't speak English.
They shook hands.
They recognized Tom.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you don't know anything about.
I'm afraid of death.
Don't run.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Tom's my big brother.
A man has been arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter by 25-year-old Maria Thomson.
Come on, you two.
>>bos_Latn<< The film was inspired by the novella of the same title.
Peter loves Jane.
Is this a real diamond?
I don't want to be cruel.
Are you free tonight?
Do you have time to help me?
This is self-evident.
Tom's furious.
Tom's gonna make sure he gets here on time.
Tom says I'm too aggressive.
What does that all mean?
We'll never know why.
My favorite teacher was Jackson.
Tom's bored.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
I have to do what's right.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I like to watch you dance.
They replaced coal with oil.
John came to Japan yesterday.
It was snowing.
We've already decided not to do that.
>>srp_Cyrl<< How can I say that in your language?
That's not a good sign.
He's a doctor, and he's also a writer.
It's hers, isn't it?
All rights reserved.
I don't live here.
I gave my mother nineteen flowers for Mother's Day.
I hope you like it.
This ticket is valid for a month.
I didn't tell him you were here.
No one knows what's going on behind that door.
I think Tom's pretty pissed.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Turns out the price was lower than I thought.
Some people think spontaneous inflammation actually happens, but I'm not convinced.
Who's gonna read such a fat book?
It's good to see you again.
We'll visit you sometime.
I don't think so.
You have to focus on your virtues.
You taught us that.
Tom can't come to work today because he's not feeling well.
I'm a terrible writer.
We could do what we started before.
>>srp_Latn<< They live in a white house with a facade brick on the corner on the left at the end of the street.
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
It's too loud for me here.
I'm alone.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm really upset about it.
Tom's alone.
If she'd been a little more patient, she could have made it.
Whatever you do, don't laugh.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?
I don't understand why Tom would want to do that.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
I'm not sure what time I should be there.
Don't open it.
Tom's already here.
I work in a hospital.
I already told Tom that.
>>srp_Latn<< They sang Hawaiian songs.
Tom spoke almost crying.
He's not missing anything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We live in the atomic epoch.
Die!
I can't wait.
Norway surprised me.
My uncle has a big family.
I never liked biology.
There were a lot of things to do when preparing for the trip.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I had lunch with him.
I'm tired of fighting.
Little kids don't know a lot of words.
Where's she going?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mary makes her living sewing.
Do not drink water from a dirty glass.
We won!
Tom ran inside.
Where will Tom sleep?
How does Tom do that?
All their efforts were in vain.
Did you get enough sleep last night?
Tom asked me if I wanted to go to Boston with him.
>>srp_Latn<< The only word written on the page was "frog".
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Do you speak Italian?
That wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
>>srp_Cyrl<< "Do you have a nickname?" "Yes, Rick."
I stayed.
Tom ate a slice of pie.
Who told you to write with your left hand?
You should have told me.
Don't exaggerate.
Nothing is working for me today.
Oh, really?
This is Brian Rock.
You can do better than that.
Tom's not an expert.
We came to London to watch a comedy.
Why are you alone?
>>srp_Latn<< Bribery government officials fled the country.
How much blood did he lose?
I don't want to bother you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Two guys ran out of the room.
It’s never too late to learn.
Please come to my house for a moment.
We have to find them first.
This one's pretty cool.
I have strong reason to believe that my son Sérgio Melo registered today, May 11, 2014 on Tatoeba as a 20,000 member!
I think that's just great.
Tom was very scared.
I speak Bosnian.
Are we almost there?
It's snowing.
I didn't recognize the melody.
I'm from Turkey.
Just tell me the truth.
You can't blame everything on Tom.
I didn’t speak French at the time.
I spent many nights curled up in bed watching television.
There's a guard outside.
Do you have any rooms available?
Can I call around 2:30?
I'm really lucky for that.
Well, that's the kind of thing that happens.
That's a nice sweater.
I don't really like Tom that much.
I didn't really want to do that.
Tom didn't see anything.
You're stupid.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom looked much different after his haircut.
Tom invited Maria to dinner.
We're not staying here.
Interesting.
Music, after silence, is that which expresses the most unspeakable.
We walked all the way to the next station.
I have two daughters.
I really didn't have any money.
Tom bent down to hide.
Have courage.
Let's rest for five minutes.
I believe in science.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Don't complicate it, Tom.
She smiled.
Just give us a chance.
Be careful.
Tom went on stage.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
Have another one.
>>bos_Latn<< The two men were business partners.
I'm learning now.
I almost forgot my passport.
Rumor has it this house is haunted by ghosts.
Will 10,000 yen be enough?
I'm not used to it.
I've got a few things to do.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.
I read Chinese very well, but I don’t know how to write it.
I can write a note to Tom if you want.
Why don't you take off your sweater?
I wonder what Tom intends to do.
I can't cheer him up.
There was a lot to eat.
This watch is cheaper than that.
Regular use of citrus fruits will reduce pores and refresh the skin.
Eve gave Adam the apple of knowledge.
I guess most people only barbecue in the summer.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
When did you get home?
He asked me to help him.
This isn't true.
I took the first step.
This is easy.
I know as much as you do.
They're scary.
They're just trying to help.
Tom told me he wanted to be a doctor.
I owe my father what I am.
Emily's English.
I asked him a lot of questions about ecology.
What are you still doing up?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
I thought you were taking the Bostom bus.
Let's go for a walk.
Can you keep a secret?
I thought you'd already taken care of it.
I remember everything.
Don't stop.
Tom's been shot three times.
Don't cheat.
You never know what could happen.
Do good to those who hate you.
I nodded once.
Hello, how are you?
He doesn't speak English.
What's your favorite TV star?
Tom fainted.
How was your day?
He's not the kind of person who steals.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
We can talk about it in the future.
We won't let you down.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do not waste words in vain.
We don't have many visitors down here.
I love him, but he's too sensitive.
She divorced her husband.
Many languages describe death and death with eumephisms.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Did you do it on purpose?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't get hooked.
I wish I could paint like that.
I'm loyal.
Tom likes cheese.
What did you tell Tom?
I know this is going to cause you more trouble, but there's nothing you can do.
You have to let it go.
What's your job?
Tom hasn't written to me in a long time.
Tom never told me what he wanted to eat.
Could you have read it?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Bye.
Tom's gonna make it.
Tom is living proof that you don’t have to be smart to be successful.
Tom's a busy guy.
You look very pale.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is a good textbook.
I've lost my train of thought.
Do you speak Italian?
Tom took out some ID.
You're embarrassing her.
My phone will be out soon.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom convinces Mary to invite John to the party.
Wait, what are you trying to do?
Let's stretch our legs.
I'm going on a trip.
That'll be all for now.
Interesting, is he coming today?
The powerless must be protected from the powerful.
I don't know if these languages are related.
I thought you'd be busy.
I want to rent a car, please show me the price list.
How long has the turtle been alive?
Haven't you done enough?
I'm very optimistic about this.
I think Tom was trying to impress me.
>>srp_Latn<< Here they appear to enjoy a fountain with ice, beer and a picnic basket.
Tom told me not to.
We went all the way to Boston together.
How long have you been a teacher?
>>srp_Latn<< Gun manufacturers should donate their money to organizations that can help countries at war.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do you think I should write to Tom?
We don't have that kind of example.
We found footprints in the sand.
We ran out of the building.
How about you?
There is no free lunch.
Mary is a very individualistic girl.
We must not allow our emotions to interfere with our actions.
She's my teacher.
Tom and I have been close friends for years.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
Tom knows what he likes.
Tom was very sleepy.
This building will be built in the city.
Come closer.
Come on!
What are you reading?
How many phone numbers does she have?
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
Don't go out tonight.
Don't strain yourself!
Can you wake me up at 7:00 tomorrow morning?
He always goes to work at 8:00 in the morning.
No controversy is ever over, and it will always come to the surface.
I eat a lot of meat.
I'm just an average girl.
Work slow.
I'm a beginner.
This tea is good.
I miss you so much.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
I'm ready.
I'm against the war.
He's walking.
He's got a nice patina on him.
Tom didn't give it to me.
Do you know how to defuse a bomb?
I already tried that.
You're my mother.
Italy is not Greece.
I'm just not that happy.
I don't live in this town.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
I'll cooperate.
I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.
Give me an example.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It all played out at the speed of light.
Fight!
That's really nice.
I've been called worse.
How did I overlook that?
I'm not at all surprised.
I saved you a seat next to me.
Looks like the victim tried to write the killer's name in her own blood.
Being powerful is like being a lady. If you need to tell people that you are, then you are not.
Tom might have something to do with it.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they say she's only with me for the night.
What's your story?
Where's Lori?
Have you been in an accident?
I'll tell Tom if I don't forget.
I'm leaving.
I pissed him off.
That's a very rare one.
I pretended not to see.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I tried to be kind.
Can you ask her to call me?
I pretended not to see.
Have you seen my dog?
It's getting dark.
Don't yell.
You know your rights.
You can't go in that room.
That's the point.
The whole town was underwater.
I didn't know where I was from.
Don't come in, I'm naked.
What do they call him?
Tom tried the button.
Can you add salt?
I'm ashamed that my son did such a thing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Success was only partial.
He always leaves for work at 8 a.m.
I'm not 100% sure.
You wanna bet?
Tom didn't like the look of his nose, so he did a nose job.
>>bos_Latn<< Beth tells Chris to take a bath or she won't go out with him on a date.
I didn't tell her you were here.
Tom bought a drink for everyone.
He described the flight in detail.
Tom knows the secretary of state.
Tom just got home.
Stop smoking.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The insurer's blown over.
Don't answer that.
I have an aunt who lives in Kyoto.
Ladies first.
It can't be hard; otherwise, women couldn't do it.
I'm glad people saw that.
She's not ugly.
I'm sick of his preaching.
No one would talk to me.
>>bos_Latn<< Also Piotr and Lech are good friends.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I have a gun.
We're overpaid for the paper.
Tom seems very nice.
We all live under the same sky, but we don't have the same horizon.
I can't imagine doing that.
My father has a good job.
He has a good memory.
Tom has a good mentor.
I came back today.
Here's a little secret.
How much money does he make per month?
What a stupid question!
I'm restless.
We protested peacefully.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mary was furious as a lynx.
Stand up and introduce yourself, please.
We're all eager to see a movie.
You have to solve your problems alone.
Where do you live, Tom?
Satisfied he laughed.
Tom's got good notes.
That's no reason to panic.
I'm glad Tom won.
Tom celebrated his high school reunion last week.
I'll sit at the table over there.
Why are you so good at explaining things?
Turn to the left.
Who's first?
Don't make a sound!
Your book is twice as big as mine.
My third husband bought me this.
I know as much as you do.
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
I'm thorough.
Let's have a look.
Tom writes something in his diary every night, no matter how tired he is.
Did you plan anything special?
My parents died.
Most scientists believe that this is caused by man's actions, through the release of methane, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, since the time of industrialization.
Will I be replaced?
Earth is a planet.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I can resist anything, except temptation.
He just needs to practice.
I paid for it.
Louder, please.
I didn't say I did it.
They know you.
You were right to worry.
I wish you'd keep an eye on my dog while I'm out.
I'm confused.
She has a good heart.
Did you bring the hair dryer?
How much time do I have left?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
I'm not taking the job.
I'm intrigued.
Does that happen often?
You can't rely on Tom.
It reminds me a little of Tom.
Everything's normal.
If you are.
Did you get the number?
You are under oath.
I blacked out.
I wish I'd known.
I haven't seen you here before.
I don't think so.
It's about 300 miles from here to Boston.
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed.
Tom only managed to save a little money.
I'm leaving work early today.
Are you enjoying your work?
She was wearing a black hat.
Are you looking for something specific?
Her composition is very good, except for a few mistakes in the pronunciation.
English is an international language.
Don't worry!
We're going to Boston and Chicago.
I'm a monk.
I currently live in Boston.
>>bos_Latn<< Ania has black and Magdalena has blond hair.
Why did you decide to stop using Twitter?
I'm not a philologist.
Am I a suspect?
I could help.
For God's sake!
Haven't you done enough?
All animals are equal.
I doubt Tom will give you the keys.
I didn't give anything.
I have a feeling it's going to rain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Caroline is sad, because she can't get pregnant.
He has a few friends.
Did you sleep?
I don't want meat.
What are you hiding now?
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Tom looks a little dazed.
I'm really happy about it.
Drive faster.
I'm trying.
I have no idea what he's talking about.
That's certainly nothing to worry about.
I took off my wig.
My life was good.
That's my cat.
>>srp_Latn<< Here is a large amount of minor errors and petty misunderstandings that distort the meaning of the original sentence.
I haven't had any complaints so far.
I can ski.
He's standing right there.
Are you afraid of rats?
I was at the front desk.
He is known as a great painter.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
Now you're lying to me.
Did Tom ever answer you?
Go look for Tom.
Tom did his best.
Shoot the legs!
"Are you serious?" "I'm serious."
Why are you mad at me?
I'd be more comfortable with an exam in the morning.
Tom didn't like the way Mary talked to him.
We need to find out.
You're sad.
What's your name in Bosnian?
Tom needs to learn more if he's going to finish his class.
I'm tired of fighting.
I wrote a song about what happened here last year.
I can't taste it!
It's too easy that way.
How's that?
I won't tell anyone you did that.
Bears are very dangerous.
Oh, really?
We know you're a coward.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
We had to call the police last night.
I'm worried about you.
Have you ever had a car accident?
She is the Prime Minister of Finland.
Please come and pick me up.
I like the way you decorated the apartment.
She decided not to go.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom travelled on the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
You lie!
It's a fish.
Tom already knew about it.
I did it, didn't I?
No one noticed that she was away until the meeting was over.
She's honest.
Who's running the meeting today?
How did you find out where Tom was?
You're not rational.
These are my best friends.
It doesn't work with me.
Give me a day or two.
She confessed everything.
Tom used to drive the bus.
Would you like some coffee?
Many birds move south in the autumn.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
This article was written in English.
Some of you need help.
>>bos_Latn<< Sugar replaced honey as a sweetener.
You're about to make a big mistake.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll go.
What's all this fuss about?
Could you please turn off the radio for me?
There is a bus station near our school.
Don't drink the water.
I was adopted.
No one knows what will happen next.
I've made my decision.
Do you have a copy?
Monday and Tuesday are the holidays.
We're going to the movies.
I don't understand why they're such good friends, they barely have anything in common.
Dan's a linguist.
I wouldn't hurt her.
This is a book.
At this stage of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent journalist's opinion of ours. You know it and I know it.

He's always unhappy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You're staring at TV again instead of doing your homework!
It really is.
Did you see me dance?
I hate the smell of onions.
Don't call me when I'm in the office.
Tom hasn't taken anything but water since last night.
Please tell me I'm right.
My wife, who grew up in Norway, has made it clear from the very beginning that it is no longer relevant for a woman to run around her husband all day.
I bought a book.
There's no need to worry about that.
I want to see you.
I bought flowers.
I'm not getting anywhere today.
Something wonderful happened today.
You're not rational.
Let it go, Tom.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
How long is the Nile River?
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Let's stretch our legs.
Are you done?
>>srp_Latn<< It should be able to be done.
Tom hesitated for a moment.
I'm relaxed.
The sun is a star.
Where's your school?
I'm currently located in Boston.
You'll probably never see me again.
We haven't had enough yet.
You underestimated me.
Without your consent, there's nothing you can do about it.
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
He's a criminal, you know that?
What a man you are!
>>bos_Latn<< The stars shone in the sky.
Tom is getting married next month.
Bedouins live in the desert.
For what?
Are we safe now?
I remember something about that.
I don’t want to try to predict the future.
Sometimes it's too late to apologize.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Spread Esperanto!
Am I welcome here?
Tom said you were happy.
You can sit next to me.
Are you ready?
His book is red.
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
My husband lost his job.
You can't help it, can you, Tom?
I put my bike in a safe place.
Books have their destiny.
Don't lie.
I've always wondered this.
Do you drink coffee?
There goes our bus.
He's running.
You are contradicting yourself.
Do you think these letters are worth saving?
I hate mosquitoes.
The house is small but beautiful.
I'll pass.
Aren't you done yet?
I really like your music.
No one trusts him anymore.
I never liked biology.
How insightful!
I haven't forgotten it.
How did I miss this?
I'm leaving work early today.
Are you ready?
Tom and his family moved to Australia.
Tom's the only one who can do this.
I must say, I envy you.
Back off.
We have to be quiet.
Maria turned down the offer because she thought she'd be better off at the bank.
Tom couldn't say anything else.
I baked bread.
I hope you like it.
I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't commit suicide.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom uses that word often.
You were made for me.
Are you busy here?
We're out of food.
Mary made her own wedding dress.
How is married life?
Do you speak English?
Where can I buy a swimsuit?
I'm trying.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They can't get enough of each other.
It works.
I didn't care.
I fell in love with her at first sight.
We're surviving.
This building will be built in the city.
Don't fight.
Everyone knows I don't love Tom.
Tom signed the cover of his new diary.
I can't even imagine that.
Jump!
I have no intention of changing.
I'm getting good at it.
They voted.
That is absolute truth!
Who are you coming with?
I have confidence in you.
It’s amazing how many sentences you can make with five words.
I exaggerated.
Tom asked me to draw him a map.
Piss off!
They really won.
Everyone has their price.
The old teacher began to talk nostalgically about the good old days.
I know you're gonna say no.
My guess is Tom won't want that.
We're gonna have so much fun.
He's not social.
They already have one.
Tom had no such problems.
The pie Tom made was delicious.
Don't shout.
He can't stop us.
It's all right.
>>bos_Latn<< The Boston Globe gave the film a bad review.
I'd like to try this.
I opened the window.
This takes forever.
The last time you pissed off your mother.
I want to go home and cry.
That's your problem.
Too late.
I'm afraid of heights.
She made the right choice.
I haven't written anything in months.
Are we safe here?
That hurts.
How can I be of help?
Orange juice is the most popular juice in America.
It won't pass me
That fox must have killed the chicken.
We need to talk about this in private.
What a shame!
Open the door!
They stuck together.
Enjoy it while you still can!
Why is Tom wearing a coat?
Stay calm.
Turn left at the next corner.
How long have you been here?
Start counting.
I don't need anything.
I sing well.
That says a lot about you.
I don't envy her.
Tell Tom to try harder.
Tom won't let us do that.
How about you?
Life has become very difficult.
They married in secret.
Tom was my only son.
It's real.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to.
Maybe Tom isn't hungry.
I always think about it.
Excuse me.
I should never have listened to you.
Tom wanted to be okay.
I have to get used to it first.
Could you repeat that, please?
Don't you think you should tell Tom about this?
Tom eats chocolate almost every day.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
Let's sit.
Don't talk.
I could come with you.
We get closer, try to understand each other, but we just hurt each other and cry.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Someone spent a lot of money to decorate this apartment.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
It used to be quiet here.
I will not try to predict the future.
This is very easy!
>>bos_Latn<< There are many hotels in the city's business district.
We weren't tired at all.
I love bread.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You have a dirty imagination.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stop gambling.
You're the great love of my life.
Several people were killed.
Sending these letters won't take long.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Her hobby was collecting old coins.
You look pale.
Try it.
We'll stop by tonight.
Fate shuffles the cards, and we play.
What would I do without you?
Emily and Melanie are English.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He's always unhappy.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
>>bos_Latn<< We ask questions to the teacher every day.
I could go there now.
I should have waited for Tom to wake up.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Have fun while you can.
I'm really looking forward to being here.
We're of the same variety.
What's up, Tom?
Tom's going through a midlife crisis.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
You bastard!
Stop talking.
I can't forget that.
Who's knocking at the door?
I've been waiting.
Whose handwriting is this?
Be yourself.
This money will really help.
Think about death.
Everything is the same before the law.
From the moment he saw him, his heart stopped.
I don't understand the problem.
You must be new here.
Please come.
Tom broke a window.
Is breakfast included in the price?
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Just give Tom a second.
I'm used to it.
Tell Tom to try harder.
I wish I'd known Tom couldn't speak French.
I already ordered it.
I shouldn't have rushed.
Check it out.
Are you done doing the dishes?
I always thought it was weird.
The ring is tight.
All we know is that Tom is guilty.
She left her children.
Thank you very much.You should also feel free and ask for help in the future.
Excuse me, who is this woman?
Tom wasn't acting like a normal boy.
Several newspapers published the story.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Tom bowed his head.
>>srp_Latn<< We have therefore set up a small portable hut that can be divided in two and can be driven anywhere.
Everything will be fine in the end. If it's not fine, then it's not even the end.
Six divided by two is three.
I'd like you to sleep over.
Let's get acquainted!
Are you done yet?
The disadvantage is being ugly.
That can't be true.
Tom has a great memory.
Please don't say that.
Let's go to the movies.
Is it yours?
I already knew the truth.
I'm really happy about it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Stay calm.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Bad weather didn't let me go.
Tom hired a private investigator to follow Mary.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The proposal was wonderful.
I don't like Tom's writing style.
Does she like my hat?
I'm sure Tom will miss me a lot.
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt you.
My French isn't that good yet.
Can't you see Tom's upset?
He's French.
I think maybe we were too aggressive.
We're never going back there.
No one knows what she's turned into.
Fish is good for you.
They know you.
I can't.
I've been asleep since ten in the evening.
I could have killed you, but I didn't.
Bye.
What are you going to do this summer?
He put his thoughts on paper.
I'm a beginner.
I'm used to it.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.
I wasn't part of the conversation.
Tom got on the bus.
You've been very quiet.
With freedom comes responsibility.
Get him.
Come on.
What's your favorite kind of sushi?
Come and see me after work.
How did I miss this?
That boy talks like an adult.
You're staring at the TV again instead of doing your homework!
Cows eat grass.
I need a haircut.
He made up for his mistakes.
I think I'll be back in about thirty minutes.
Have you ever wanted to live on an island?
No one cares why Tom is a vegetarian.
Tom's pretty secretive.
Did you eat something?
Thomas is easily frightened.
I'll try everything once.
Tom taught me how to read.
There's a math test tomorrow.
Don't let a chance like this slip through your fingers.
Laughter is contagious.
They sell fish and meat.
It was just like that.
I recognized him at first sight.
I've never worn a nightgown in my life.
We'd better get ready.
I'm into her.
I'm sorry, the connection is still busy.
Tom just told me the opposite.
He has one son and two daughters.
Here's your bag.
You're the boss.
He took Jane out to dinner.
Who broke the cup?
You're wasting your time.
What Tom said doesn't apply to this situation.
There are several reasons.
What do you intend to do from now on?
I'm really proud of it.
Stop worrying so much.
What's the matter with you?
I like grapes.
What do you have to do?
I didn't care.
He's back from Canada.
>>srp_Cyrl<< "You talk too much," he said.
I'm really happy about it.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
We missed Tom so much.
I'm not ashamed of it.
They'll know what to do.
We failed.
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
I got off the train.
You promised you'd help me.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I feel good now.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
She can't stop us.
Are you saying you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I don't buy it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was bare-chested and barefoot.
Everyone says I look like my dad.
Come early so we can talk about our plans.
Tom, do you prefer dogs or cats?
Tom can't play guitar.
He looks young for his age.
I don't know why my head hurts.
Let's do someone a favor.
I will always remember your advice.
He cheated on his biology exam.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
Thomas is crazy about Mary.
With the money he inherited from his grandfather, he bought an engagement ring for Mary.
Who are you trying to trick?
Take care of yourself.
Me and all my brothers share a room.
Layla started crying right away.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like that diamond's real.
Learning all of these phrases by heart is out of the question.
What have you done now?
I'm sure you can do that.
You can't go in that room.
How old are you really?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You tried.
Tom decided to sell the car.
Who are you?
>>srp_Latn<< There was a new snow avalanche on the road in Ecescaret in Oda municipality in Hordaland on Tuesday night and it is not known if anyone was trapped in the avalanche.
Are you Uyghur?
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix the car on my own.
Open up!
Please hurry.
Tom nodded his head.
Do we need to tell anyone?
He's turning blue from the cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom thought.
Don't be mad.
His memory loss is more of a psychological than a physical problem.
He died.
He started yelling.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As it came, so it went.
It's not as bad as it looks.
I'm mad at Tom.
Tom could be better.
She lives a happy life with her husband near the sea in Kamakura.
Tom got fat.
The spider took your car.
So what if it's true?
He was ahead of his time.
Don't bother.
Do you speak Greek?
It meant a lot to me.
The effect was quite different from what we intended.
Fish, please.
Aren't you done yet?
I’ll have to think about that question,
Tom was talking about music.
Everything has its price.
It was warm yesterday.
There were so many people on the train, I had to stand.
Are you Uighur?
Curiosity killed the cat.
Why do people go to the movies?
I don't have homework today.
Tom and Mary are getting along fine.
When can Tom come home?
Did you do it on purpose?
In the window glass I see a reflection of my face.
Go talk to Tom.
Make up your mind.
There's no use trying to talk him into it.
I was thinking about my family.
You could have spared me coming here if you'd told me I shouldn't have been here today.
This will make it a lot easier for us.
How's the weather in New York?
I've been gone too long.
Is it true you're going to study in Boston?
Tell me where you live.
Let's go over it again.
Whatever you do, don't leave the toilet seat up.
Are we going to see Tom again?
Start now.
I have no intention of answering all the questions.
You'll have to ask Tom.
That should save us some money.
He worked 10 hours non-stop.
This one's pretty cool.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That publishing company is solvent.
Pick one.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Stop looking for a prince on a white horse, they don't exist.
It's his, isn't it?
Tom will probably still be angry.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I'm too old for something like this.
I'm not buying it.
That's a fake, isn't it?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Will we ever see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.
I want my dream to come true.
He accepted that he was a monster.
You have the right to be happy.
This model can be combined with any color.
Sugar replaced honey as a sweetener.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Enjoy it while you still can!
Can you cook?
Are we starting soon?
I will never find true love.
You can't go in that room.
I went to see my parents.
You know I don't like eggs.
I burned my tongue.
Go ahead.
Are you done?
The first step is the hardest.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary read the entire 321 page manual in her breath.
I'm thirsty.
How old is this plane?
I want to get married.
I just got here.
I went to church this morning.
What eye hurts?
Tom's not as smart as he thinks he is.
Why should I listen to you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< It never should have happened.
I'm leaving school.
How old are you?
What kind of movie is this?
Did I drop that?
Turn to the right.
It would take me forever to explain everything.
I haven't worked for many years.
What a beautiful house!
I haven't forgotten it.
Can you take me home?
What do you have in mind?
It's getting dark.
Don't get in Tom's way.
I really like to exercise.
"Are you a teacher?" "Yes, I am."
She's Japanese.
I can't believe my eyes.
You have to go to school.
That book costs 3,000 yen.
Better ever than never.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A hamless sandwich is not a sandwich.
Looks like Taro doesn't have a girlfriend.
Emily's gonna surprise me.
I just started working here today.
I don't know if I have time.
She doesn't like being told what to do.
What have you done to me?
Fashions age and die.
Mostar is a beautiful city.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
Tom never forgave me for doing that.
Speak up!
We're both not as rich as we'd like to be.
Carl showed me the gold medal.
Tom plays the piano very well.
Essentially, my dear Watson.
History is written by the winners.
I'm deeply ashamed.
The Golden Key opens everything.
You'd better come at once.
>>srp_Latn<< The writer of the book The Last of the Mohicans, James Fenimore Cooper was the first nature conservation fighter.
What do you like?
We should start over.
>>srp_Latn<< He has extensive experience and his competence has branched out into several areas.
That's enough!
I like grapes.
I bought a lot of things.
When is your birthday?
I'm devastated.
I assumed you were busy.
It's clear.
Keep digging.
What's all the fuss about?
>>bos_Latn<< Tom's confidence is shattered when his boss takes him down in front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried at all.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that for me?
I probably won't watch this.
Stop worrying.
Come in.
Did I call you?
Most people are afraid to set a big goal for themselves because of the fear that they will never reach it.
I'm naughty.
I do.
That's all I care about.
>>srp_Latn<< They sat on the grass, played ukulele and sang.
I can't imagine life without books.
I'm very tall.
This building is blue.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The house is built of brick.
I could eat a horse.
It's a really nice day out there.
My name is Jack.
I'm ready to talk.
She has Ukrainian citizenship.
I want to see what you have in the house.
Better by grace than by force.
This must be important.
Maybe they need some money.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom could speak French.
It is the third largest city in Serbia.
Tom is outstanding.
What year was your car built?
Sit still.
He's a tall boy.
I'm the one who solved the problem.
Where are they going?
Does Tom know about this?
What do I tell them?
I went into her room.
I can't sleep at all.
They didn’t manage to do the same in the second half.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
Study hard.
It takes a lot of imagination to try to add a new sentence here.
Things might have turned out better if you hadn't gone there.
I checked.
Finish this.
I have to go to Istanbul.
Tom became a hero.
He came to see you yesterday.
Your secret is safe with us.
Tom's having a bad day.
Don't answer that.
Is there a red rose?
All or nothing.
I'd like to leave.
Tom was not convicted.
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Stop trying to make me feel bad.
>>bos_Latn<< Pride tends to become hubris, which is a close relative of folly.
>>bos_Latn<< Those who have never thought of the value of life should not study medicine.
How long will Tom last?
The rainy season begins in June.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I changed my schedule.
I wish I could paint like that.
Tom was waiting for me.
This village is boring.
Vladivostok is a city in Russia.
Shut up!
Tom says this is absurd.
I never regretted it.
We limit luggage to 10 kilos apiece.
I tried to be kind.
We're never going back there.
Years have passed.
>>srp_Latn<< They established an Air Joint Command where the Director and Chief of Staff were, respectively, from the Navy and Army.
Tom took his ukulele and started singing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He started roaring.
Will we ever see Tom again?
Let's consider the worst that can happen.
Walk slowly.
She's usually late.
You're sad.
Let's try.
This place is a mess.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they don't think she's good enough for me.
Tell me what you wrote.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom went to the reunion last week.
Tom left this morning without finishing his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm so sorry, Tom.
Such a state of affairs cannot be tolerated.
We've never played football before.
You can study here.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
The dog licked the pelvis with his tongue.
It's so bright.
When's the meeting?
I could go there now.
Why would Tom want that?
I do.
I'm stubborn.
The lie got him in trouble when his boss found out the truth.
What do you mean by that?
Do I demand too much?
He looks good for his age.
Can you tell me where the bathroom is?
I really like my team members.
What did you both do?
We're in trouble now.
It looked so delicious.
I have a rock in my shoe.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.
He asked me to help him.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom has a younger sister, Mary.
I could have used that.
I was very excited.
Don't shout.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I saw Tom die.
You're in better shape than I am.
How so?
I'll do my best to find them.
I could lose my license.
This must have belonged to her.
Tom told me what to do.
He congratulated me on my success.
I know exactly what I need to do.
I'll take your proposal into consideration.
I'm still awake.
Tom's on a trip.
We'll let you know as soon as we find out.
Sign above this line.
It's simpler now.
She told me everything last night.
What can I do?
Was I really that happy?
The fuse's blown.
I can't fight it anymore.
I could lose my pension.
Tom can type really fast.
Sometimes she writes to her son.
Today's Monday.
Don't talk.
It happened right here.
Everyone changes.
I'm not too upset anymore.
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
Tom's worried about getting lost.
I think it's best to be polite.
Africa is the cradle of humanity.
Louis Braille, who had been blind since the age of three, invented a way for the blind to read.
Tom has high moral standards.
Thanks for the email!
My favorite teacher was Jackson.
I’m not the only one who didn’t like this movie.
Don't you remember the question?
I like it when it's cold.
Pick one.
You'll be completely safe.
Don't jump!
I didn't know.
I turned around.
Stay there.
This one's pretty cool.
We did everything we could.
Piotr has black hair and Lech has blond hair.
Head or letter?
We don't have much time.
Tom knew Mary was in danger.
We just need one chance.
I love the beach.
There's no point in trying anything else.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I think Tom likes baseball.
What are your ambitions?
She forgot to turn off the light.
I'm sympathetic.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
I was surprised by Tom’s response.
Do you speak Greek?
Am I a suspect?
Tom complains all the time.
Tom's a stickler, isn't he?
Better a kiss in the woods than ten in the hand.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
You need to speak up.
Tom lost his job.
Tom's thrilled.
Are you a student?
Who is this man?
I love watching you work.
Did you have lunch?
It's mine, not his.
Oh, my God!
How much is this gonna cost me?
I'm a hero.
For every male character, there is a female version.
Are you talking about us?
You're so cute.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary felt hurt when her children could not make an effort to contact her for March 8.
Tom was saving money to buy a car.
I'm not at all surprised.
How much money do we need?
>>srp_Latn<< This model can be combined with any color.
It's June 18th and Muriel's birthday.
I just got here.
I'm fine.
You just need to exercise.
Are they friends?
Do you want to hear the truth about this event?
What is your nationality?
Stand by.
I was so busy with Tatoeb again that I almost got dehydrated.
I'm kidding.
Excuse me, do you speak English?
We have to do this.
I know I'm not perfect.
Mary sat on the grass, playing the ukulele.
Before this decision takes effect, no one will lift a finger to resolve this.
Do you have anything to report?
I've always hated doing that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known Mary wouldn't want to do that.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Keep moving quietly.
I'm happy.
I miss talking to Sally.
Tom will talk.
They were all young once.
It wasn't easy for me.
Good-bye!
He's speeding up.
Things changed after that.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
I got in the habit of doing that.
It's not the right choice.
It didn't hurt.
I like the bread.
Be yourself.
It's all in the report.
>>bos_Latn<< It does not need a scholar to interpret
I have a grudge against Tom.
Fantastic!
Don't yell at me.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You must be new here.
I've met some wonderful people.
I had lunch with him.
Your house is big.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There was a heated argument.
Think again.
How's Tom doing at work?
Tom needs a doctor.
I want to be a man again someday.
Why is it so complicated?
What am I doing here?
Rome is located in Italy.
Tom often wears black.
How do you do?
Do you want to come in?
Maybe I'm missing something here.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many great thinkers who were unknown during their lives became famous after death.
Is he a doctor?
Check around.
>>bos_Latn<< Greeks also eat a lot of fish.
I appeal to the public to contact us with information.
Our school was founded in 1990.
You can sit next to me.
Danger lurks around every corner.
Are you sure this is safe?
No one agrees with you.
Tom sells cars.
Fits on one floppy disk.
Sooner or later it happens to everyone.
I'm fat.
Anyone for a beer?
My father gave me a lot of money.
We're about a wolf, and a wolf's at the door.
I'm not used to it.
I'm glad you answered.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She is a yoga instructor.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I got an idea.
Tom bought the pantyhose.
They will know what to do.
You're definitely crazy.
Are we ready to go?
I'm free.
Three times five is fifteen.
My mother planted flowers in the garden.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
Tom is not confused.
I have a feeling he's pretty arrogant.
Tell him I'm innocent.
It's not a new problem.
Have you ever used any of these?
>>bos_Latn<< Her dissertation must be written in English.
You sound very young.
I have to go now.
How hard would it be to do that?
Find yourself a place.
I'm okay.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
After winning the lottery, she went out shopping.
I am not happy with this situation.
It's getting harder for me to concentrate.
You don't have to be afraid.
Show me the pictures!
I think she's from Austria.
Please wait until I'm ready.
It's always like that.
I was just thinking about you.
I'm interested.
Sleeping on the carpet is great.
Louder, please.
Can you talk to Tom for me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep for a few hours.
I'm young.
What happened?
>>srp_Latn<< An intelligence satellite is a military satellite capable of monitoring many activities on the ground, listening in on communication lines, registering the working frequency of radar systems...
Why are you acting like this?
He married her for the money.
Cheers!
I asked you last night.
My parents died.
Let's sit here on the grass.
You're very pretty.
I doubt you'll find it difficult to get a driver's license.
Tom says I'm charismatic.
It's a depressing story.
You don't look so good.
Everyone makes mistakes from time to time.
I'm glad you're back.
I'm not talking to Tom.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom and Maria play chess with a set of hand-carved chess pieces supposedly made of ivory.
If an account already exists, a system will work that allows you to receive and send emails.
Go talk to Tom.
The dog is mine.
I'm not swimming.
I'm confident.
Why don't you take off your coat?
I'm really proud of it.
Follow him.
I think we should focus on other things.
Did your girlfriend like the flowers?
Free the slaves!
I'm a little new at this.
This should work.
What's your name?
I live in Turkey.
Nancy's from London.
I'll call.
It is the third largest city in Serbia.
FIFA consists of 209 associations.
Everyone was waiting.
There are many secrets in life.
Tom told me he lost his notebook.
I'm happy.
We've got enough here.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Give me the key, and I'll unlock the universe.
We banished him from the country.
Tom left his key on the table, as he often does.
Where's your friend?
I hate mathematics.
I'm so excited.
I'm homeless.
I don't want meat.
I thought I'd been stabbed.
I'm just thinking out loud.
I thought you were going to Boston by bus.
Is there anyone in the house?
Why tell Tom anything?
I could have used that.
I hope I can write two or three songs over the weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
It doesn't mean that something is a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom comes back safely.
I like what you wrote.
Don't bleat.
Can you stop singing so loud?
Everything's ready.
Coffee's cold.
Where did you find this knife?
They need you to help them.
Do you have anything to report?
We want complete sentences.
Get your ass over here!
I don't own it.
I really hope Tom's predictions come true.
If we'd gotten here sooner, we might have been able to save Tom.
Why are you leaving?
Gold's in the green woods.
I'm scared.
You met my sister, didn't you?
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mom transplanted flowers into the garden.
Who bought this?
>>bos_Latn<< Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
Who left the door open?
I can't live without a TV.
Tom sat very still.
We should wait for you.
Norway has a lot of old empty barns.
She worked so hard that she eventually fell ill.
I'm not the fashion guy.
I wouldn't hurt him.
I can't forget her eyes.
Show me your papers!
I've never tried to do this before.
Sugar dissolves in hot coffee.
I can't believe you lied to me.
Tom writes beautifully.
She was prescribed medical cannabis to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy.
Come and see me after work.
Are you involved in this?
So you want to learn another language.
What day is tomorrow?
Tom put down his drink.
Maybe he'll come see us tonight.
Air conditioning's broken.
I'm not like anyone else.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I've never seen her before.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Multiplying three by five gets fifteen.
Get out.
I didn't think you'd want that.
Would you like some more mashed potatoes?
And then something amazing happened.
Of course, such a project required a budget rebalancing.
I was angry.
I'm not sure where Tom is.
How much time do I have left?
I had no idea what to write.
I can write very quickly.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Swimming makes your legs stronger.
Keep trying.
I forgot to pay the rent.
I'm sleepy.
I didn't do it either.
There's a guard outside.
I'll be in my quarters.
>>srp_Cyrl<< San...I tried to explain to St. Peter, and I did it in German, because I didn't want to be too explicit.
You're sad.
We'll get over it again.
Sure.
I didn't get nervous about it.
I think all three of us know what to do.
It's fun.
Girls love to play house.
I wish I hadn't done that.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The older we get, the weaker our memory serves us.
The train arrived on time today, as always.
Will you talk to Tom for me?
Why me?
Norway is my new home.
We barely survived.
It's stuck.
You'll never catch me alive!
Tom is the youngest.
Has anyone told Tom about this yet?
Did you do the dishes?
Come closer.
Time flies.
This is my mother's computer.
Tom is not the right man for the job.
I'm a hero.
Tom took the kids to the park.
Please stop here.
Tom does look familiar.
I'm just messing with you.
I'm not ready to go.
How can anyone sleep with all this confusion?
Tom could convince Mary to do it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fate shuffles the cards, and we play.
Was I really that happy?
Are we safe now?
I have a slight pain here.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't monkey around!
I try.
He made her happy.
What did you do today?
How much will I take?
She was the only one who understood me.
I want his head.
A gluten-free diet is the most effective treatment for celiac disease.
I'll take care of the rest.
You can't just eat one.
Be careful.
Dogs are smart.
I give you what you want.
Start counting.
Get out!
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm going to leave early today.
How adventurous!
Tell me what it is.
Have you finished your homework?
Get lost!
Who's knocking?
I'm really happy to be here.
Please don't shout.
Why are you being childish?
Eat slowly.
We could have saved Tom if we'd just gotten here a few minutes earlier.
I know this is weird.
I'm glad we were there.
Do you have anything to say?
Why did you do that?
Tom was very nice.
One of you is wrong.
I want to live in the city.
I need to buy a new coat because my old one's worn out.

>>srp_Latn<< There is little doubt that cutting in an already stripped-down system will have dramatic consequences for industries and municipalities in rural areas.
>>srp_Latn<< You were offended by it, even though it didn't have that meaning at all, and it was supposed to be something funny on my part, but you didn't see it that way.
Who has time for this?
I'm still sleepy.
Tom's a day-trader.
My stomach hurts.
This will take forever.
Millie doesn't eat an apple.
We calculated that we could get to that place within two weeks.
I passed all the tests.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary works as a waitress at a nearby coffee shop.
Let me explain.
I forgot the baby-monitoring device.
She reacted to that.
Leanne lives in Leicester.
I'm naked.
We got free calls this weekend.
What do you have there?
So, what's your secret?
This one's pretty cool.
Just be quiet, please.
I don't understand what the teacher is saying.
I was happy.
Have a good week!
>>bos_Latn<< Doping is not compatible with my ideological views of sports.
I bought a book.
I'm coming to save you!
I'm wearing flannel pajamas.
I'm scared to death.
There was only one small problem.
We talked about plans for the future.
I'm all alone right now.
You deserve a reward.
That was terrible.
Why are you giving it to me now?
I wasn’t at all confident.
That's all for today.
Never say never.
I participated in the contest.
Have you eaten anything?
France is in Western Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
>>bos_Latn<< Planes land at airports.
That's all your wisdom!
I called him.
Tom was wearing a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom always looks unhappy.
We're out of money.
I think everyone's overreacting.
When are you leaving?
Tom unlocked the door.
I'm very happy about it.
I'm thirsty.
Tom turned to leave.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put it.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Maria?
He wakes up at seven in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom will be able to help us get through this.
He's not honest at all.
I'm already paid.
You have seven children.
Tom and I went to the same high school.
They're all distracted.
Did I call you?
Come back on Tuesday, if possible.
We have to be realistic.
Don't stare.
Why didn't you say so?
Forgive me, my love.
I lost everything.
They accidentally heard some suspicious activity in the bushes indicating that the bear smelled their food.
I've been all over Europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't stare.
You asked for it.
It's mine, not his.
How is this your fault?
You're sad.
Everybody's lying.
Is he a teacher?
He went to the sea to swim.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Come to my neighborhood.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm devastated.
Tom is in constant pain.
The first step is the hardest.
>>srp_Latn<< The other girls in Mary's class made fun of her for her clothes.
Everybody's either going through it or going through it.
I'll get right on it.
I'm broke.
Stop moving!
>>srp_Latn<< Tom and Mary enjoy a walk along the pilgrimage route in France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these sentences into Chinese?
Did you watch it?
Are you busy here?
I choose between two possibilities.
How do we know he is innocent?
Have you ever tried it?
We have what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Did you get a good look?
Tom asked me to wake him up at 7:30.
We didn't do it.
Did you do the dishes?
The young man is a doctor.
Please pass the salt.
The spaceship was destroyed.
How does Tom do it?
Be careful.
Do you have a paper I can write on?

Dogs bark.
She came alone.
Do you agree with that?
Where is the museum?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw a cat.
Why is love so complicated?
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of Christmas book sales, and it's unlikely that any book will take it out of office.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a fuss?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sami lacks some board in his head.
I got an old bike.
Did you wash the dishes?
He didn't come to the last meeting.
Morning!
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
Your secret is safe with us.
Am I wrong?
You need a hobby.
I assumed you were busy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At the next intersection turn right.
I told you it didn't work.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You too, Brutus?
Are you dyslexic?
If only I'd known.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I often borrow books from Tom.
Change your clothes.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything is well prepared in advance.
I don't count on it.
I don't know what that is.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
He's poor but too proud to ask for help.
"Who's in the car?" "Maria."
They gave water to their horses.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I'll give you anything you want.
>>srp_Latn<< The girls wore grass skirts and had flowers around their necks.
I'm not feeling well, can you call a doctor?
The world is unfair.
Do you know she likes animals?
Tom's the only breadwinner in the family.
He may already be gone.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He started yelling.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't be rude to me!
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
>>srp_Latn<< You can format and adjust the table for cross-calculations, insert and use plain tables, diagrams, formulas, and functions.

Tom was sophisticated.
>>srp_Latn<< This sad story was written at a time when Tom was in exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
She drinks like a fish.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Do you have anything to say?
Change your clothes.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
He dressed like a woman.
Men want to feel wanted.
She tried.
You shouldn't send that email.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if your husband left you?
Can you prove that?
Dead end.
It's so easy to write with this pen.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom named his hamster Cookie.
Are you ready for more?
Don't change your mind so often.
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me play?
I don't like to learn in this heat.
I'd rather not be involved in this right now.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
There's nothing to do in this village.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play guitar.
He is a man of experience.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what they both like.
It must have been awful.
Your plan sounds great.
You sound surprised.
I'll lend you my workbook if you promise not to write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house as me.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find him?
Are they in love?
Where to meet tomorrow?
The house is in his possession.
Tom saved Mary.
What do we want to do, learn a few languages?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is deaf as a cannon.
Latin is the language of the future.
I think everyone's ready.
"Have you seen my phone?" "It's on the table."
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Did you eat anything?
Let's get this straight.
Stiglic is a very interesting bird.
There's no point in waiting.
The relationship between personality and blood type has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
The cat came out from under the table.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
Your house is big.
Even if you spend a lot of time inside you can practice lifting your knees as high as you can while walking or while walking in place.
You're everything to me.
I want to get married.
Hold my backpack.
I did check some things.
Tom knew Maria didn't love him.
I don't sing.
It was love at first sight.
I'd like to kiss you.

Are you coming soon?
Many young Romans went to Greece.

In the beginning is my end.

I have to go to the mosque.
I mean, I am.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Sami used to talk to young women.
What am I supposed to see?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't strain yourself!
Tom can knock real fast.
I can't answer you right now.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
I want a sword like this!
Identify yourselves.
Take the money.
Tom still looks surprised.
I'm saving up to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up like that.
He soon recovered from the shock.
I give you what you want.
This is pure escapism.
Who did you write the letter to?
I might need some help.
Karin is Austrian.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm tougher than I look.
No one came.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
You're sad.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train.
Focus your camera on the flower.
I won't be home next week.
When I was a kid, I used to visit him on Sundays.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That'd be okay.
What do you call that?
Welcome back.
How does Tom know French?
I love watching you work.
Answer me now.
There is no established policy.
Write down what I tell you.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Redheads are driving me crazy!
Do you love your mother?
He finally fulfilled my request.
There was a big explosion.
Tom winked.
I didn't step outside today.
Did they give you a reason?
Can you spell your name for me?
Look at this.
I have an aunt who lives in Kyoto.
She was saving her life.
What wine do you have?
Do you think she did it?
I think we should call a doctor.
Life in Tokyo is very expensive.
You're awfully early today.
We caught Tom red-handed.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom was not happy with the results.
I hid under the table.
They're holding me hostage.
I think this is obvious.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Emma was very conspicuous at the party.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.

I'm a big fan of football.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary makes a living sewing.
Can you pass me the water, please?
Where's your friend?
The terrorists have freed the hostages.
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it at all.
Tom is used to winning.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Tom isn't sure what he wants to do with his life.
Tom asked Maria if he could borrow her English textbook.
We've come for you.
Call security!
My scarf is blue.
The earth is too small.
I'm intrigued.
What do you believe?
What do you want?
Medications should not be mixed with alcohol.
There's a bakery by the butcher shop.
Did you see who it was?
Try this.
When I woke up, it was snowing.
Some people, no matter what age they are in, don't lose their beauty.
Tom took the Russian sentence.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
That's pretty remarkable.
Tom shrugged his shoulders.
Bad things will happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Investigate her.
I'm very impressed.
She was dressed in red.
I should talk to my father about it.
What does the sovietologist study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Where's the dog?
Have you fully recovered?
We had a big fight.
Tom's still hiding.
How about you?
We're the same soy.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
Keep working.
Hope is lost when you're experiencing a difficult situation and a senseless braking.
I laughed.

You better shut up!
Tom and Mary decided to adopt John.
The baby is asleep.
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's so easy.
All men are the same.
He's not a kid anymore.
We're almost done.
Is it clear?
They haven't woken up yet.
Everything's free.
Welcome aboard.
We have no other choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
My friend was shocked when I told her.
I think Tom could do it.
I'm thinking about going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are Americans really that individual?
I asked Tony a question.
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
Tom came to Mary's birthday party.
What's your specialty?
He couldn't help but laugh at her jokes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She released the bird from the cage.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't influence that.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
I wasn't too surprised.
I saw him take something like a pot out of a box.
What's your name in Bosnian?
Do you know how this machine works?

I love France.
He's good.
Did you know that?
I think so, too.
Are you ready?
Money talks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He's my rival in business.
>>srp_Latn<< I prefer a tent with a storm cover, along with crossbars for wind stability and snow drifts, and this has to be a two-tiered tent.
Tell Tom I said hi.
That's very sensitive.
This is my wife, Edith.
I can't be something I'm not.
She lost money, family, friends.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Now present yourself using these Sentences!
My name isn't "you"; it's Ricardo.
Where will we meet?
We have to consider all options.
I hope this never happens again.
It is very likely that it will rain tomorrow.
You're driving me crazy.
You don't need my permission.
I remember everything.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
It has a beautiful flower, but it does not bear fruit.
I'm touched.
Tom told me to knock on the door.
Tom's fired.
Are you planning on going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
>>srp_Latn<< This candidate is significantly better compared to his predecessor.
Don't call me when I'm in the office.
Who bought you this?
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor examines the patient.
Tom passed his drink.

Let's hope you're right.
We parted on the corner.
Are you mad about that?
I burned my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could rely on Tom.
Open up!
When there's no news, it's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did that come out to me?
No one died.
Did you sleep?
I'm deaf and dumb when I eat.
They tried hard in court.
My name is Sally.
I'm not practicing.
Is there a reason you keep these old bottles?
We talked for a while.
I have to go now.
Can I use your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That fabric's not from India, is it?
Who are you?
I’ll buy what I need tomorrow.
I may be antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're being honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Don't yell at me.

Tom's selling cars.
I'm sick of your whining.
I've never noticed that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Mary is a bookworm.
Tom broke something again.
I'm too old for something like this.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
Yeah.
I love this store.
I'm about to come looking for you.
He leads a tumultuous life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I've lost the flow of thought.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom has the right attitude.
>>srp_Latn<< Anatomic breast implants, however, can also lead to deformation of the breast shape if they rotate to the side.
Where did you get the keys?
I won't tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little dazed.
I saw the bus.
It's no big deal.
Tom's smart enough not to do something like that.
I brought these reports for you to take a closer look at.
We're both not as rich as we'd like to be.
Can I kiss you?
Get on board.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
Tom's still pissed.
How do I know you won't turn me in after I help you?

I'm from Japan.
What is the longest river in the world?
Just stay out of this.
We need your help.
What am I doing here?
What does this mean in Arabic?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He kicked the ball in the goal!
Is Tom sitting here?
A plastic cup is better than one made of real glass.
I laughed.
Just give Tom a second.
I gave them an anniversary present.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The expensive porcelain broke into paramparchads.
Like father, like son.
I want to thank you personally.

I'm really sorry, Tom.
Where did you find this knife?
Speak for yourself, Tom.

Do you have any idea about my life?
He was tired of reading.
Can we order now?
The code is Muriel.
We can't stop here.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom did not for a moment think of trying to convince Mary to do so.
Don't argue with me.
Hey, give me a chance.

>>srp_Cyrl<< He likes to make a donkey out of a mosquito.
I completely disagree with that.
The boy is thin.
It's a routine thing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He never got over the death of his son.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than I do.
I can't do anything today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom hit the switch.
My children need me.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn’t read it because it was too small.
Of course, Tom's wrong.

Tom wasn't very energetic.
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
It won't help you if you worry.

The cat is not human.
So this is how it ends?
What's this?
I'll take the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
He sleeps like a baby.
I'm taking the day off.
Are you blaming me?
That doesn't appeal to me.
That ruined the mood at the table yesterday.
Stay in the house.
I thought you were going to Boston by bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Fuck you!
I might not sleep tonight.
You're wasting your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had any trouble falling asleep.
It's locked.
I'll think of something.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care of yourself!
I will not try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this hour?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is it all settled now?
Please send me the doctor's bill.
What's this about?
Have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new at this.
I improvised.
Magdalena's interested in geography.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No. What's the matter?"
That's what they both like.
You and I need to talk.
You were spying on me.
There's no reason to be scared.
Turn around.
The pen I'm writing with belongs to Tom.
Where did you see Tom?
Just close your eyes.
Mary lost the key.
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?

How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
Great!
How do you know so much?
Tom smiled.

I'm sorry I even tried.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A girl named Pizza and Mr. Mash were walking in the woods.
Either way, you're wrong.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Redheads are driving me crazy!
I'm not bitter at all.
A man has a lot of desires that he does not even want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite.He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment for him.Such a desire is also a desire for eternal life. Had it been fulfilled, one would have become completely sick of infinite life, and would have wanted death.
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
Jumi is one of my friends.
It amazes me.
He just needed a little time.
I didn't think Tom would do that.
Sorry I'm so late.

Education in this world disappoints me.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed.
That's encouraging news.
Pass the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Every day you read something that no one else reads. Every day you think something that no one else thinks. Every day you do something that no one else would be crazy to do. It is bad for the spirit to always be balanced.
Why are you so smart?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He escaped danger.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mayuko had a strange dream.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt you'll find it hard to get a driver's license.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Did you do it intentionally?
Is it all settled now?
>>bos_Latn<< How can it be that mathematics, which is nevertheless merely the product of human thought independent of experience, is so astonishingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
We weren't careful enough.
They armed themselves with guns.
Write something.
Did you bring coffee?
Looks like Tom's an honest person.
He was seen as the ringleader of a murder case.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Attention!
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had a quick lunch.
He risked it.
Giraffes have very long necks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Girl sees boy.
My parents died.
His wife patched up his shirt.
Someone told me about it.
Swallow your pride!
Technology can help.
To change the red meat, I cooked turkey breasts in mushroom sauce for tonight.
I'm always cranky.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom teaches French.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I've always liked horror movies.
Chances are it will rain tomorrow.
Something just came up.
I can't get over it.
You sound like you're not having fun.
I couldn't stop crying.
You've gained weight.
Works for me.
They're not mine.
I fell to the ground.
I'll be late.
I double the prices.
Could you do that?
There are also cats on Mars.
I didn't vote for Tom.
I called him.
>>srp_Latn<< A video recording of the interview was made and was released throughout the Internet.
You need money.
Tom got drunk and drowned his sorrow, after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we take a break for a while?
Go take a look.
Tom was just about to say something.
Some people like to travel alone.
It's over.
Is it true Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
You're the boss.
Someone's here.
I guess we'll never see each other again.
Is that what you think?
I didn't do that either.
Do you have anything to report?
I say it all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I just got here.
I watched Tom die.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Have you ever seen anything like this?
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
That's life!
How did I get here?
Why not?
He rarely gives up.
I've been looking for you.
Tom let out a muffled sigh.
You should have known.
There's a lot of work I have to do before I can go home.
It's snowing today.
Money is not a measure of success.
He dared to ignore my advice.
Girls work.
By the way, where do you live?
Looks like it's a pretty big museum.
Any questions?
We gave in to their demands.
It's hard for me to understand French when it's spoken fast.
The rest is irrelevant.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do I smell sarcasm?
It's almost half past three.
They'll know.
Tom bought a pair of black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Let me check.
>>srp_Latn<< Zurich is considered one of the major financial centers.
That's a very rare one.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not in a hurry.
Do you play any sports?
We weren't careful enough.
Are you okay?
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not stretch out.
I've been to more than ten foreign countries so far.
It's not getting worse.
Answer me.
People have short memories.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a tough job.
I'm happy we won.
You can't go in that room.
My mother was furious.
"Are you feeling better?" "No, I'm getting worse."
Are they friends?
Everything is fleeting, but good memories live on.
I was in the mountains.
It's heavy.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Which is easier?
Did you wash the dishes?
We had a big fight.
It was a drop that poured over the glass.
He doesn't like us.
Please, go on.
This could hurt.
We'd have saved time if we'd gone down Park Street.
A police officer arrested him for drunk driving.
It's gonna be crazy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is seen.
Tom's always daydreaming.
That would be great.
The knife's not sharp.
We hope people will like it.
We all have a price.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Why did you shave your beard?
That gave Tom an idea.
I got lucky.
Trains in Serbia are very slow.
Nobody knows me in Boston.
They lived happily ever after.
This road leads to the city.
Your time will come soon.
Tom thinks there's something wrong with some politicians.
Where is Tehran?
Because they're made in Italy, these jeans are very expensive.
>>bos_Latn<< Run over any obstacle with this monster of a truck!
We went to see turtles on the beach.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary spends a lot of time on the phone, sending messages and emails to friends.
He always wears dark clothes.
Happiness was on our side.
Tom works for his father's company.
Tom says he wants to change.
What's this about?
I want to help you.
We're not going back to Boston.
We never lose hope.
Men remain children all their lives.
We're close friends.
Mary hasn't cooked the meat yet.
Now we need the truth.
I'm supposed to be here all afternoon.
Haven't I taught you anything?
You can go to sleep now.
Why do you ask?
It's big.
It's mine, not his.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It turns out to be true.
Quick as it is, it's couscous.
Can you take me to her?
Where were you born?
Come sit next to me.
Measure it three times, cut it once.
I found him a book.
>>bos_Latn<< I was barely able to hide my indignation at her impertinence.
Butter is made from milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
He can't come because he's sick.
It's getting better.
Do you want to see something specific?
That's not the real problem.
I miss her.
I don't know the answer.
I passed the exam!
It's really hot.
Let's start right now.
Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please don't yell.
Does he still have a fever?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
Who is your teacher?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
What have you done to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
Everybody's watching the World Cup.
I'm still a little tired.
What is your blood type?
We can't go back.
We will visit you from time to time.
These headphones don't work.
Keep trying.
I couldn't take my eyes off you from the moment I walked into that room.
Tom didn't have the courage to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
