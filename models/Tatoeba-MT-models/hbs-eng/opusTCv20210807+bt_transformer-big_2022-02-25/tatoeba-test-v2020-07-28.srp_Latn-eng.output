You're sad.

It's no big deal.
How much will I take?

If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing a lot of things at the same time.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you alone?
Did you see the sunrise?
She put the ring on her finger.
He's as intelligent as his brother.
Tom's on a business trip.

I can't live that kind of life.
Tom's hungry as a wolf.
It was a tough decision.
Everybody's crying.

You're very rude.
Yesterday I went to bed without brushing my teeth.

Come run with me.
Drive faster.

I forgot.
It'll take me a while to get used to it.
I'll be there.

You're kind of right.
Even though I told Tom not to open the door, he did.
Go straight.
Piece of cake.
I'm good at a lot of things.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'm leaving school.
We will visit you sometime.

I think it was intentional.
Don't work too hard!
I am proud of this team.

Try this.
No consequences.

What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom looked angry.
I've never noticed that before.
Probably better not to eat after 7 p.m.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Give me a hand.
Which way are you going?
I like to sleep on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.
I just want to get home.

Enough already, Tom.

Come on in.
You win!
That's what they both like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
>>srp_Latn<< Most scientists rejected the theory of moving continents, because it was so difficult to imagine that plate movements were even possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you tell Tom?

Tom will change.
I reacted instinctively.
You have to do it somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you post videos on YouTube?
Do you know who Tom killed?

I'm just very grateful.
You got it all wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's a bad kisser.
Start counting.
You must never come back.

What do you think this phrase means?
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
Sorry, I didn't follow up.
Tom knows the drill.
If a man is promoted in front of a woman - this is called favoritism. If she is promoted, in front of a man, it is called equality.

Come back in an hour.
Tom uses that word a lot.
Tom was staring at his feet.

How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would rather stay.

Are you sure this thing is safe?
You're the reason I came.
We are what we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.

Are you going back now?

Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved the dog very much.
You're absolutely right.
They can never do it any other way than by force.
I thought I'd get another shot at it.
He'll understand.
That's not why I'm here.
I assumed you were busy.
She's finally asleep.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom laughs at Mary.
It's almost half past three.
I don't know if that's gonna be enough money for me.
Can you close the curtains?
Have you tried it before?
That seems inhuman to me.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little kitty?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?

Just be careful, Tom.
I'll understand.
I'm in better shape than you.
Maybe they're around the pond somewhere.
I wish I'd known.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's out of shape.
I don't have enough time to explain it to you in detail.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
I'll call her tonight.
It's been a crazy year.
Forget it, Tom.
It is impossible to say with certainty.

I'm surprised you didn't know Tom could speak French.
These are my best friends.
I swim in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?

Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
Sami was Layla's dance partner.

Tom is still frustrated.
Tom made it clear he wasn't going to do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are types of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but in the long run even the best teacher gets angry if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's really no need to do that.
Hopefully it will be dry weather.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches the next day?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind that door.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Let's see you, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
I’ve read about 100 books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never been camping.
I'm only listening to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
Did you do the dishes?
>>srp_Latn<< When he returned from duty in Afghanistan, Tom was haunted by nightmares.
I've made my decision.
Thank you so much!
It won't have any effect.
Don't bleat.
Do you have the right one?
I need your help.
I'm a responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom's proposing could save us all a lot of time.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy right now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
Everyone else did.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what it is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Either way, you're wrong.
It’s hard to give up long-term love at once.
Tom loves extreme sports.

We must respect our personal rights.
What is that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anyone want to go to Disneyland with me?
Why is train photography so interesting?

Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom tried to convince Mary not to, but failed.

There's got to be a better way to do this.

I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but did not send it to her.
He has a good memory.
The limbs are numb from the cold.
Tom's not very nice.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're being honest.
Come play with us.
You know Tom ever lied?
Mary is Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy right now.
Here's some good news.
I am proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
>>bos_Latn<< There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about that.
Don't stretch out.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.

Did I ask you?
I've seen enough so far.
Turn around!
It took four kilos of gold to win the gold medal.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to add numbers to his head.
Take care of me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to believe me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man in question?
Will you talk to Tom for me?
We have to act now.
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
We're here to play golf.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't shout.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is hard.
Save your energy, you'll need it later.

You just got shot.
My income is down 10 percent.
It can be hard to get around unfamiliar terrain.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After much consideration, I ended up making things at random.
That's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
We're shrinking.
Can you talk to me?
Turn the TV down.
In the summer, I wear short-sleeved shirts.

See you in your dreams.
Come on in here.
I'm going home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid for that.
I've seen enough so far.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?

I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is, without a doubt, a very uncomfortable situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She jogs every morning before breakfast.
This road leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.

I've never seen that before.
I got here a few minutes before you did.
I didn't do it either.
How much does a bottle of beer cost?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's too bad.
I'm done arguing.
I've got plenty of room.
Don't shout.

That's your train.
Come and see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I try to be careful.
Check this out.
Come quick!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
Music is important to me.
Do you have a favorite?
Please, come.
Take it easy!

Could that be true?
Keep it down, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
What are you going to do this summer?
I tried to stop doing a lot of things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what I have to do.
I wasn't told anything.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary did.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad weather prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that one's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know a gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
What's this?
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom only talks to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You've put on a lot of weight.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
I can do a lot of things at the same time.
No one is as fast as you.
I agreed to buy that.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go in that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered in your foolish business.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving up to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
>>srp_Latn<< The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective road link to Oslo and East Norway for the entire western region.
You let me down.
I'm really happy about it.
Tom suspects Mary and I are up to something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
I just won't do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It is their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Will we see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I try to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I was listening to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
>>srp_Latn<< Avoid addicts on paint thinner.
I liked that one.
Do you like roller coasters?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom was unable to attend the meeting because he was ill.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you being so paranoid?
Tom was running around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She wonders how that's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose the pretty one.
Look at the size of it!
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have difficulty talking about my feelings.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom will arrive.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
>>bos_Latn<< We can watch Tom in a suit, after a black grand piano with dramatic finger strokes, creating music that is very enjoyable to listen to.
The strong winds broke many branches from the trees last night.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
>>srp_Latn<< The path to the male heart leads across the stomach.
It's time to get up.
>>bos_Latn<< The house was built of brick.
I didn't write this.
I can't help feeling partly responsible.
People have been good to me.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried it?
I could come with you.
Have some.
Come inside.
There's really no need to do that.
I wonder what Tom's planning to do.
>>srp_Latn<< In order to join the choir, you need to be able to read notes.
Tom dozed off.
They wanted an apology.
What did I do wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for a human being to always give himself priority over the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
What are you still doing up?
I was at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
A dull, insensitive child can sometimes grow up to be a sociopath.
I'd like him to stay with you.
It's the police's job to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you hand me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We all work too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom learns very quickly.
You're different.
She's unfamiliar with other people's hatred.
This will make our job a lot easier.
He loves football.
The monks could play tennis in the monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I wondered if I might be dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Driving to work takes an hour and a half.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm a natural.
I turned around.
I completely forgot to do it.
Marriage is the main cause of divorce.
He's here.
I'll make something up.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us feel that such views are pure madness.
Someone could get hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary while he was gone.
We've had enough of you.
We all know Tom did it.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom got the worst of it.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a little nauseous.
Is this the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's OK.
I've read about 100 books so far.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great difficulty.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you get the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on my math test.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Investigate this.
My future is in your hands.
It's a fake, isn't it?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone either.
I think that's really important.
It's so sad.
How clever!
In short, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
I played the piano a long time ago, so I can still do a little.
Is this your cup or your sister's?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter have represented two generations.
He told himself he had to work in the garden two hours a day.
>>bos_Latn<< Apples and pears are donated, not gold and green forests.
Resting my legs.
I really like to exercise.
I'm really proud of it.
We were in last place.
I contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're absolutely right.
Come, sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this right now.
Time to split up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The briefing report is ready.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you eating, anyway?
I don't like to be judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
A man hopes as long as he lives.
Be careful.
Let's discuss the options.
That was a funny movie.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate that.
>>srp_Latn<< "This came for you." "Uh..." "But, do you remember the one she sent you when you asked her to give you pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write a review of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a review to Mac." "...Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from that?" "But I realized that Phillips's a no-good-s-for-good-for-looking-for-to-to-to-be-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-be-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-be-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-be-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-be-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-be-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-do-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-do-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People have been nice to me.
How did I overlook that?
I only go to church out of respect for my mother.
It is better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don’t need to eat right away before you go to sleep.
Tom will wait.
The students did not know how to respond.
I'm not a night owl.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm the one who should be doing this.
Tom will call.
>>srp_Latn<< He lit the torch before entering the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's some truth to what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of you whining.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
The horse must have tripped and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm looking into it right now.
She's achieved her goal.
Tom can do whatever he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what they both like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never takes the train.
The two sides will be making speeches this week.
I'm planning on giving my son the computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw a cat.
I'm in a cast.
Mom just went shopping.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
Tom needs help.
Defend yourselves.
He took a taxi to the hospital.
Can you juggle?
Don't touch the lion while he's sleeping.
Tom is unfit.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
To be honest, I don't know.
These are your choices.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw a puppy.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient died.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I that different?
Whose handwriting is this?
Feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad to be leaving.
The eagle is the king of birds.
The fire hit the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you've got this all wrong.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to information.
I'm grounded.
The cat lay stretched out the entire length in the sunlight that penetrated the window.
Do you walk or bike to school?
Tom isn't much happier.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I am proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't very impressed with that.
I left Tom in 2013.
Maria knows that her main weapon, a beautiful face and a young body, are of transitory value.
I saw a mouse.
He's trying.
The two countries negotiated a peace treaty.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me now.
They seemed to know what they were looking for.
You tried.
We'll just follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
Tom needs sleep.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that town.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Tom's not a kid anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm in the habit of doing that.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll keep you posted.
I instinctively responded.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was bare-chested and barefoot.
She's just out of my league.
What exactly are we looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
>>bos_Latn<< Schools and roads are tax-paying services.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like it's just the two of us.
Today things are very different.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old way.
Where is Tehran?
Let's look at it again.
Sounds like a betrayal to me.
This needs to be practiced.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
>>bos_Latn<< Under the drawing, he wrote "Grab the wieners!".
Drive slow.
What a man you are!
Measure twice, cut once!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why this language? Because it is beautiful and stimulates our learning. International language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. After all, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you get some sleep?
I'll take you to Tom's.
Could it have been Tom?
I have three beautiful grandchildren.
Don't argue.
She grabbed her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom pointed to the sky.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything strange.
You're never on time.
That sounds like treason to me.
I'll try not to disturb you while you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
>>bos_Latn<< All participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom will make progress.
Tom was absolutely terrified.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt a bit.
We have to escape.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not picky.
That's what I'm used to doing.
Tom's still at work.
You think better when you close your eyes.
Are we all here?
I feel dizzy.
Tom was moaning in pain.
All or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I contributed.
I'll sign.
You're embarrassing him.
Exactly.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom is rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
That's not really my job.
I turned around.
To be honest, I don't know.
I hope he's all right.
The wind has calmed down.
I have a mirror in my bedroom from floor to ceiling.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Don't say a word.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
>>bos_Latn<< The cheque-check festival took place in Latvia.
We are what we are.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
No one's coming to save you.
I have no desire to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She is proud of her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How is this your fault?
Security has increased in the city.
Cheers!
Tom will stay.
That boy's talking like he's an adult.
Carrots cost three dollars.
My bike is new.
Tom told me today that he loves me.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I walk you home?
I've tried that before.
Go upstairs.
Parking is not allowed there.
>>bos_Latn<< Biegam early.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's how he shows off.
How long did you stay?
Tom is an avid cyclist.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.
I'm too busy at work.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom's family moved frequently.
We liked the food, especially the fish.
And they lived happily ever after.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
Don't stare.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom was accidentally made.
Is the handsome man Arab or Hindi?
Let's meet for a drink.
I forget where I put my hat.
He's done it again.
I want to see the ocean too.
Don't make a sound!
Who doesn't?
Tom does that sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
What do you say I do that?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said he was innocent.
All the girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
>>bos_Latn<< Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing, or yawning.
Tom's nibbling on his nails.
He was a man who never hesitated to stand up.
>>srp_Latn<< Probably the periodic appearance of rabies occurs because floating ice from Siberia can carry polar foxes on them.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I've been having memory problems lately.
I'm Canadian.
I'll try.
Am I ever wrong?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's official business.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Is he your new boyfriend?
Forget him.
I agreed to buy it.
What do the newspapers say?
>>bos_Latn<< The surface temperature of the sun is about 6000°C.
Sami asked a lot of questions about Islam
If we leave now, we'll be in Boston by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where will Tom sleep?
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to tell what really happened.
She ran her fingers through her hair.
Tom is working hard to support his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
Let's see what Tom says.
I'm starving.
Don't argue.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I'm not afraid of getting old.
I don't completely agree with you.
There are many possible answers to this question.
Let's have ice cream now, before it melts.
I'm just doing my duty.
I took the first step.
I love watching you play.
It’s hard to put what we said into practice.
How long have you had a headache?
Ole, the world's oldest eel, just died.
Come to the meeting.
I am proud of this team.
I overslept.
Your mother put a collage on the top shelf.
Did you see anyone there?
My father's so old he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I wish I knew how to paint like that.
I'll try to find them.
I had trouble solving that problem.
I don’t know what isn’t, yet or just before, was good, but more than once when I tried to log into the site today, I couldn’t do it.
Do I usually look happy?
I went there of my own free will.
You think better when you close your eyes.
They really meant it.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptable.
>>bos_Latn<< The fugitive from prison was quickly caught again.
Everything seemed possible at the time.
I faxed the map to Tom.
I have memory problems these days.
Tom might not make the meeting.
Tom died almost instantly.
The judge hit her with a hammer.
>>srp_Latn<< They also found that the same miscalculation was made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We need to find Tom.
I hope this never happens again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed a few days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do anything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was only a matter of time.
Don't stare.
It should be able to change.
Does Tom have cable?
Those who want to stay can stay.
If the rental period is extended beyond the agreed period, a proportional fee will be charged.
Why should I tell Tom?
Let your imagination run wild.
Tom knows the names of all his customers.
Tom keeps over 80% of what he earns.
Are we safe now?
We are what we are.
He's not honest at all.
Great!
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm dyslexic.
You've been very helpful.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about it.
It just has to be that way.
I come when I can.
Don't stretch out.
It's not all gold that shines.
Are we all here?
We need to focus on our virtues.
How fast!
Faith can move mountains.
I'm not giving up!
Tom fell off a truck while feeding reindeer.
Tom became a plseach even though his parents wanted him to.
I think we've met before.
I've made mistakes before.
Can you tell us more?
Tom knows it's over.
It's treason.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
You don't remember anything?
Tom drinks a lot.
I'm not from here.
Tom was sitting on the grass under a coconut tree.
Everyone laughed.
I'm tougher than I look.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Do you have a copy?
Come and help me.
I could barely get out of the house when it started to rain.
Tom likes to be busy.
First things first.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little bummed.
Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any evidence?
You have to be strong!
Are you ready for more?
Tom turned on the blinker.
Tom always makes me laugh.
She rarely, perhaps never, goes to bed before 11 a.m.
Are they all crazy?
What are you eating, anyway?
He's so weird.
This is where I draw the line.
Pay attention to the school rules.
Keep digging.
What school did you go to?
Can I hear another one?
They all ran away.
I've already written to Tom.
Tom had to re-write the composition.
You want to get involved?
I knew I shouldn't get involved in your crazy business.
Tom asked me for permission to use my computer.
Was I really that happy?
Tell me what this says.
I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get lost.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
>>bos_Latn<< His younger brother is a well-known footballer.
I was just too busy.
I already ordered it.
How does that work?
Will we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
That's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what it is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It would be difficult.
She makes him meals.
Where did you learn English?
Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.
How are you feeling today?
Tom needs a reason.
Okay, what's the secret?
Are we starting soon?
Did you see me dance?
I'm starving.
Naoko lives in a white house.
Tom plays the piano very well.
Tom managed to escape just in time.
I don't know anything about her.
You just got shot.
You're the reason I came.
I'm not rich enough.
Seniors should pay for their hats and dresses.
Am I seeing things?
Don't move!
It was all Tom's fault.
I've been training for months.
What was the plan, anyway?
You're supposed to be here at 1:30 at the latest.
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
I saw a hippo at the zoo.
I think about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
Don't go out tonight.
It's not easy to entertain Tom.
He's a man of his word.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke in two.
Muriel is now 20.
Have you eaten anything?
Did you go to see Tom?
Tom's gonna make it.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
The window is made of glass.
Are you done already?
Does Tom have a key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll feel better in a few days.
That's what Tom would want us to do.
Tom said to ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not bitter at all.
Tom is a bookworm.
I changed my mind.
The problem is it's too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thinking beings, if only they could get that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
It's not the right thing to do.
Please write down everything I say.
I wish you could sleep over.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We need to move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like to eat garlic in the morning.
I think Tom is very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
I think I'm fat.
I think we got lucky.
Don't talk.
Come have a drink with me.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
>>bos_Latn<< They were evacuated to the American Field Hospital.
We'll run in the park.
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about it.
Could you read it?
We have to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom let you down.
Tom was badly injured.
If you need help, let me know.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
First one leaves at 5:30 and arrives at 8:25.
That was kind of weird.
Does he read and write Japanese?
Tom put the card on the table.
It was just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now a word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't help it.
Time for bed.
Tom wanted to have a nicer cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring the hair dryer?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know why.
How are you feeling?
Bitcoin and Ethereum are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you can think of can help.
Many predictions do not come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I feel bitter.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows all about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man of many talents.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Tom was Mary's first love.
>>srp_Latn<< The proposal was carried out by a hand-raising vote.
Tom may have to stay here for a few days.
My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
I thought the food was great.
I'm deaf and dumb when I eat.
You look fat.
You have to learn English step by step.
Tom is better off now than he was before.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom and Mary are as different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to be fulfilled and it would be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of such desires is the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, one would become completely sick of eternal life, and would long for death.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car by myself.
She takes care of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together
The news has arrived.
No one really wants us.
They all paid.
Be careful.
I'm alone.
Do not drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold changes every day.
Tom got married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is train photography so interesting?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a slob.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
Do you like costumes?
I saw Marcus' house.
It really is pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
The house where Ataturk is born was in Thessaloniki.
People make mistakes.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
Let's hear your excuse.
They formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom was jumping up and down.
Tom's dog has gone to bed.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
No, no.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project.
You're texting Mary?
I'll save you a front row seat.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary pushes her children to play football.
Are they here yet?
Don't forget to give me back my pen.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What did you conclude?
I've been praying for you.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
It's only a few minutes away.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You are average students.
>>srp_Latn<< In childhood, many violent criminals ruthlessly tortured animals.
How long are you gonna stay mad and yell at us?
How much does it really matter?
Shall we have an aperitif?
If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
I'm used to it.
It's not that bad.
I love playing music written by my friends.
Tom admitted it.
It's hard working with you.
Tom's put on weight.
Guilty as charged.
Don't answer that.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the photos!
It takes a few old houses to break down.
What have you been doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
Tom's very considerate.
When will you go?
This report wasn't written very well.
She said the latest move by the government has multiple meanings.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom did not attempt to deny Mary's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
His hair covered almost all of his face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll make it up to you.
>>bos_Latn<< One student from Oslo who forged his degree to enroll in college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Tom made some vegetarian chili.
I was trying to help you.
You've been really good to me.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not the essay itself that's the problem, it's all these pernicious questions and explanations of words that are driving me terribly crazy!
It's the weekend.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
It was a stroke of luck.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
Clean up a little.
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people love chicken.
I didn't do that either.
Let's have another look.
The last time I went to the beach, I burned to death.
Pull back.
>>bos_Latn<< The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We fixed some damage caused by the stones spraying on your car.
His wife did not offer support.
Do you suspect me?
Fortunately, Tom did not get seriously injured.
Tom is going to cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
How could I resist?
Tom is afraid of death.
I can't fix the car by myself.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
Let's not get into that.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely got the worst of it.
There's no match for him.
There's nothing wrong with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve. Then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; therefore, it is time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
Tom won't run away.
I'd go.
Down!
Tom couldn't take it.
Anything you can think of can help.
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the eye of the likes of you, but this is just pathetic.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
Please keep this place as clean as you would like to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
There's only so much we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I sympathize.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
You learn by doing.
You'll never walk alone.
It's Tom you want.
They won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
It's quiet again.
I failed.
Tom goes to graphic design school.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
>>bos_Latn<< You should face reality.
We managed to escape just in time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It should work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Have some.
Talk about others like they'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Find Tom.
Seems okay to me.
Whatever do you think?
You changed my life.
Reaction is not always the best way to act.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to drive him to the airport.
>>srp_Latn<< The committee recommends that those who complained should be reimbursed with a proportional portion of the annual fee with interest.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's distracted.
>>srp_Latn<< Remember the filenames before trying to perform the return of deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
I didn't get nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
A lot of things work out for me.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
Tom's always been a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
How long do you think Tom was getting ready for the exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to throw stones in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
Don't split hairs.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I probably won't be watching TV tonight.
Did Tom get the long end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
The girl sees the boy.
It is very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
It happened right here.
I don't know Latin very well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting on my turn.
I was very shaken by the news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you prefer tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I passed every test.
There is no point in waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
It snowed yesterday.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I wrote this song just for you.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
Even if I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this as a mail order?
What do you suggest?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch it!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
Slowly they moved forward.
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Don't stare.
It's blue on you.
Come visit us soon.
Have you been in an accident?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
We're all out of alcohol.
Ticket, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives in the middle of nowhere.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Tom doesn't have that kind of trouble.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a busy day ahead of you.
That's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully served.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always act rationally.
I didn't do that either.
Did you pass your exams?
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Do we agree?
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went that way.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
Can I see your ticket?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
It's clear.
Today is your daughter's birthday.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typo.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like to be.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a nice garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got naughty hair.
I've seen enough so far.
I hate that one.
We'll miss you very much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom will take a look.
Here's what I think.
I could come with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you disarm the bomb?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many songs have you written?
We're glad to have you here.
You can write in any language. In Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
How do we manage others when we can’t manage ourselves?
Don't rush it.
You can learn, regardless of age.
He dedicated his life to achieving a vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who have you helped recently?
Just close your eyes.
Tom's a little worried.
How is this your fault?
How did I overlook this?
What should I write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptable.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
He's fixing electronic devices.
You lose.
I'm ready, bro.
Please kick as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Pass the sugar, please.
It’s nice to be needed by someone.
I hope we can figure this out.
We all have to stand up to this.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired, I can barely keep my eyes open.
Throw me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever posted a video on YouTube?
>>bos_Latn<< I was very interested in participating in building a more intensive academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Don't let Tom know that.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you right now.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary used walking sticks that helped her on the ups and downs of her journey.
The compass points north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
On whose initiative was this done?
Finish this.
Which one should I take?
I love cable dishes.
Where's your friend?
When do we start eating?
>>bos_Latn<< The Queen and King reunited their powers.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I suppose you already know the answer to that.
The flowers are completely gone.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book the least.
Blue looks good on you.
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said he'd be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother, John.
I'd take it.
They'll know what to do.
Why were you silent all the time?
He's undressed.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I've dislocated my right shoulder.
You really need to take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
Drive slow.
My right hand is numb.
I know almost nothing about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
A little bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take it all.
I resigned.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.
>>srp_Latn<< Marriage between persons of the same sex is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland as of yesterday.
Take this home with you.
She bought bread.
We'll try it your way.
Help yourself.
You deserve my congratulations.
Since the message was in French, I could easily read it.
Finish this.
Tom tried to talk Mary out of it.
Could you pass the water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more diligently.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us saw Tom do that.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
You spelled my name wrong.
You're different.
You're embarrassing her.
I have two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend was not supportive.
I wasn't interested in that.
>>srp_Latn<< Some of them were and still are in constant danger due to political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I don’t think the internet is a place for children.
It's been hard on me.
What did you figure out?
You were made for me.
He needs her.
It's obviously a typo.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a stickler.
Control yourselves.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things will happen.
Several trees fell during a storm in our area.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
They all smiled.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I'm out.
Tom looked angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing is going very well.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
That helps us a lot.
I filled the glass.
I'm not picky.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
That morning, Mary visited the whole village.
The rumor spread quickly.
Am I that different?
Tom took the keys out and opened the door.
I just got here.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It helps.
Dima slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This is making me very uncomfortable.
Costs will soon rise.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom will call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Do they suspect me?
What do you have to do?
Tom likes to drive.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
The winter is over. Spring has come.
It really is that simple.
Since those papers were about no farmer wanting to work as a tenant in Westfold, interest grew rapidly.
I'm grounded.
I have to go inside.
We're a little busy here.
All aboard.
It's really surprising.
Have you ever seen a UFO?
You're standing on my aisle.
It got dark.
What's the big secret?
The police are after me.
I took the first step.
I hope Tom remembers this.
We ask the teacher questions every day.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
If the world wasn't in the way it is now, I could trust anyone.
>>srp_Latn<< Three of the wounded, for which it is currently unclear what condition they are in, have been evacuated to the U.S. Field Hospital.
I prayed for you.
Ethereum and Bitcoin are cryptocurrencies.
Hello, can you hear me?
We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Every time I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, folks?
Will you help me?
It didn't get that bad.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see it work?
Is that a yes or a no?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for the day.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, there is a general precaution to avoid infections in this type of patients.
I'm a free man.
I don't like bigoted people.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
It could be a weapon.
I can't fix the car on my own.
I'd better go with Tom.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips burst into a sinister smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary's enthusiasm for the course declined when her favorite lecturer moved away.
I don't want to be rude.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
Tom was nervous as he started a new job.
Help me.
The United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.
Are you reading something interesting?
You can't smoke here, you can't have your cancer anywhere else.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom is always very nice.
I barely slept a wink.
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really that happy?
I took off my wig.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom is named after his father.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm going to take a nap.
What was I supposed to do?
Stay away from my wife.
They will know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend, I was just pretending.
Did I drop that?
I just want to get out of here.
Why do you think that?
Little kids like to touch everything.
She curled her hair with papillotams.
He was released from military service.
My gums are bleeding.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which one of your friends is coming?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
You tried.
I'm taking you dancing.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do it.
She's making a mosquito out of an elephant.
You told me not to lie.
He used to be a member of the social elite, rather than a representative of the broad masses.
I'm terrified.
Help us to reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Take your time.
Give me a pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There is no answer to the question of what is best, because it is always individual and depends on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
You seem like a very smart person.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year for training.
>>bos_Latn<< The house burned to the ground before firefighters arrived.
The months with the most rain are May, June, July and August.
Do I usually look happy?
I've already written part of the report.
I was ready for it.
Show me the documents.
It has something to do with...
It can hardly be about passion, maybe it's just sex.
Are you done doing the dishes?
I'm the only one here who can do that.
Tom will pay.
Hunting season is over.
I love the Kabyle cuisine.
I'll start with the beer.
Oh, thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I'm almost never home during the day.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their innate talents.
I'd go.
You're very rude.
You let me down.
There's snow all year round on this mountain.
I don't think you should rush into anything these past few days.
What's in nature forever, when everything is so fleeting?
The engine's overheating.
I'll see you later!
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
This might not be enough.
You got that right.
Everything you have will one day have you.
No matter how busy Tom is, he never forgets to email his shirt at least once a week.
The dog is dead.
This is life.
Do we have one of those?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom stopped for a second.
Due to bad weather, the plane was delayed.
Investigate them.
I'm in better shape than you are.
I'm not that worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'm going to take a nap in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
>>srp_Latn<< He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test, before being sent for laboratory testing.
We walked in the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
It's been a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom watched closely.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
What is your job?
Let's continue the discussion.
How much do I get?
I want to be with you.
This was refined and embodied in a personality so strange, rigid and stubborn that few dared to work closely with it.
She's pregnant.
Don't move!
I could be there by 2:30.
Merauke is the easternmost city of Indonesia.
Tom used to come here a lot as a student.
We'll take the next one.
Did you do your homework?
Check everyone.
Tell us a ghost story.
Check everyone.
Session's over.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We have to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
I'm pathetic.
I can't wait until Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
>>bos_Latn<< Cut the cheese into thin slices or into small cubes.
Have you ever been in a car accident?
I'd like to get started.
I wasn't wearing intrusive clothes.
I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence caused a real stir.
Give food to the homeless.
I translated the song as best I could.
He left a few minutes ago.
I believe you're being honest.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom has an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Even though I was sick, I did my best.
Big boys don't cry.
I could go there now.
I need to write 10 pages for next Monday.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I need to sleep.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom usually comes to school before any other student in the class.
I'm touched.
Even if I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Why not?
"Where should I sit?" "Anywhere."
>>srp_Latn<< Wisdom is needed in order to understand: music does not exist for a deaf audience.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Troubled children are often without any sense of guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.
I invited him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom's blushing.
Tell him.
How to get rid of moles in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
Where are you now?
It is very likely that FIFA is rotten to the core.
She gave me a contradictory answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He wears a gold chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of it.
Ataturk was born in 1881 in Thessaloniki.
At least Tom's honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Is this what you told Tom?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only 5:00 in the morning, and it's already light outside.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, a crossover with that will happen eventually.
Tom's a good Frenchman.
I couldn't help Tom do it.
I know this is weird.
He never got over his son's death.
I'm just doing my duty.
They all sat down.
>>bos_Latn<< If you have nothing else to do, then the number of the Greek Islands.
She always wears bright clothes.
Will that solve the problem soon?
Mary put a ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom seemed older and more mature than the other boys.
It'll take forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She smiled.
>>srp_Latn<< The devotees of Vishnu are called Vishnuans; the devotees of Shiva are Shivans.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown.
I completely lost track of my thoughts.
I never regretted doing that.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Romani?
Tom came to see me yesterday at noon.
Hello, my friend!
Tom's still at work.
Did you get enough sleep last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all along.
>>srp_Latn<< "I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in the things people make I want to see scars, failure, disorder, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I turned Tom down.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that one.
This transcends all boundaries.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom reads a lot.
I hope you're not talking about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm not usually this busy on Mondays.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom looked very confused.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
>>srp_Latn<< "If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "If not Q, then not P."
My wedding has to be perfect.
Move over.
We should study.
We have no other choice.
When the weather is like this, it's best to sit at home and not go outside.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During an experiment on the power of perception, Tom could not describe a single painting from the wall of his living room, even though he had lived there for two years.
It's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
Everyone held their breath.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I love watching you work.
We hope to visit Beijing.
You're my inspiration.
This time I refrained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did someone call me?
We'll have lunch together at 1:30.
I'm still a little tired.
To strive to maximize one’s self-interest, happiness, or safety seems very natural to one human being.
I can do it as a joke.
I don't sing.
It's strange that no one knows the victim.
We're five minutes away.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit that.
That was just the beginning.
Have you finished your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never been camping.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the rings on the tree that we knocked down and found that it was thirty years old.
I'll see you later, Tom.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Let's make an appointment.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect something else to happen?
Tom still seems shaken.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people will like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
I want to show you something.
Remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're afraid of me.
Yesterday I was happy.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one helped us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
He still has no experience for this job.
Can you help us?
You want to chill?
>>srp_Latn<< Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
Who can't be proud to be a Serb, with their historic highest achievements - the massacre of chiefs and genocides?
Do you know how to defuse a bomb?
Where did I leave my keys?
I'm a big fan of football.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom lost his touch.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom will take a look.
I wonder if someone could help me. I have a cell phone that just shows an error message.
I'm surprised.
Everyone was smiling.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You underestimate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can speak Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written part of the report.
Don't stop.
Please come and see me tomorrow.
It was kind of weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one's died... yet.
Can we humans digest grass and extract nutrients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom was writing on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
The odds are against me.
I'll quit.
She expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstand me.
That's good.
I'm not gonna push you.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Are we leaving soon?
They sell sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does that sometimes.
Thank Tom for his help.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
Photos of nature and animals, taken in complete silence and tranquility, are real masterpieces.
My mother died the day I got married.
I'll never mention this again.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
We have two children.
I think Tom's careful.
The white family will arrive in Tokyo at 11:30.
What have you done to me?
Enjoy.
Let me write you some steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute whatever she's wearing.
Watch it!
>>srp_Latn<< Tom failed to present any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad temper.
I was just leaving.
I bought this yesterday.
I've had a very bad day.
The whole country is talking about it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made an omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm naughty.
Yesterday I was happy.
>>srp_Latn<< From the way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Now's not a good time.
He's not a kid anymore.
I try to ventilate the futon at least twice a week.
My education has made me who I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I am there.
You want to join?
Put the book on the top shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw the Saudi ambassador resign.
Be careful.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I had trouble solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do it.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
One moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
>>srp_Latn<< "If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(Not P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came in a little earlier than usual today.
A horse could be eaten.
I've never actually met Tom.
Which is easier?
Tom demanded an increase.
I've never noticed that before.
This is supposed to work.
I always liked Tom better.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
>>bos_Latn<< Tom bought the newspaper and read them on the train on his way to work.
I have house spirits.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary Really Married?
Let me try another one.
Work slowly.
I didn't do that either.
Snorri Sturluson's stories, among other things, show that Christianity in Norway was spread by violence.
Answer me now.
Make yourself at home!
The students did not know how to respond.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I tripped.
I assumed you were busy.
That elegant gilded chain of hearts is the necklace that will “shake your world.”
It all happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It was raining hard.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take some more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.
Dinner was held at the White House.
You should leave the planning to me.
You can avoid a lot of problems if you just do it right the first time.
Marie jumped into the river from the window.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm terrified.
I'm doing great.
Did you expect something else to happen?
John and Mary always walk hand in hand.
What did I do wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I've missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
Baseball is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
I was just stalling.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We're lost, aren't we?
We're not gonna let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a ticket.
Nothing happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth must be told.
Look how big it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
I always eat fruits and oatmeal for breakfast.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
>>srp_Latn<< We suggest that the water quality is checked once a year in pipes, twice in wells.
Dear God, it’s really hard for people when they have to call your attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes, or your appearance, for example.
What did you say?
Tom could do better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a great nothingness.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary in a long time.
"Yes, orange juice, please," Mike said.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I interrupt you for a second?
The students did not know how to respond.
Good intentions are important.
I've already thought about it.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
Just looking around.
Do you want to know something specific?
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
>>srp_Latn<< Interability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I don't know.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students attended the meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He called off the meeting at the last minute.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's good.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters consider Maria to be the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom will not vote in this election.
I'm sure you'll do fine.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Make way.
Tom is also well known in Australia.
Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes, they might come true.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who will come with us?
Sounds like you learned an important lesson.
We've never been apart.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
At that moment, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91% of the Norwegian population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
What does she drink?
Tom is very rude.
Don't forget to write the date.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
It's perfectly normal.
>>bos_Latn<< A new restaurant is said to have been built.
The price of this book is $5.
Can you keep secrets?
I assumed you were busy.
When the fire broke out, he was asleep.
I never thought of that.
Quiet down there.
Tom explained it in detail, but I still don't understand.
That wouldn't like it.
I'm really curious.
Tom double-parked.
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do about Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands at sea.
I've never had any trouble falling asleep.
I didn't see anything.
Are there other options?
The amount for the work done and interest in the invested capital were several million.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need something to drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't completely agree with you.
Are you saving this place for someone?
How are you these days?
>>srp_Latn<< The week has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back late.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no need to panic.
He didn't even hear what Tom hated about us.
I don't want any beans.
It's been a long time since I sent anyone a letter.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom works about nine hours a day.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
I'll take a shower.
We have four French lessons every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Alone is our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation that pleases the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't exercise.
Thank you so much!
Keep the change.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom turn himself in?
>>srp_Latn<< Europeans gained an advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
I will pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
It pisses me off a lot.
Is there still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
A lot of birds are on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I assumed you were busy.
Don't you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very nice of you.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw a cat.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom comes back safely.
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Whoa!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom is strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate hot dogs with potato salad.
Come alone.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where you from?
I promised.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a layabout.
I eat a lot of meat.
Tom's a nerd.
>>srp_Latn<< The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, having become a victim of a conspiracy, he is convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like to be.
Can you tell Tom I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
One foot in the grave.
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
I'm sympathetic.
Tom is unhappy.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy as hell.
What do you know about me?
I've been reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me in the least.
How old are you really?
Tom asked me if I had slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Nice to meet you.
This place looks a lot different than it used to be.
Why Are Rabbit Ears Big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
Tom sent his son to bed without supper.
Tom's an idiot.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
It's very rare.
What did I just do?
It’s best to do things on the go.
This one's pretty cool.
I really enjoyed it.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Kedda.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this band.
We hate Tom.
This one's pretty cool.
Tom cut the tape.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary said she would reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they did not increase her salary.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a little longer.
I won't do it!
I'm tired of arguing.
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
I was definitely lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could be a mess.
I just want to get out of the way.
Don't let a chance like this slip through your fingers.
Be careful.
She's in her first year of college.
I looked for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Can you make Tom laugh?
My fluent knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not for expressing my often contradictory emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a tremor in my heart.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
I'm sorry to always bother you.
He is a man of power.
Great!
I'm ticklish.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it on time?
It's funny the mailman hasn't come yet.
How do we prevent that from happening?
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'm about to buy a boat.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
You ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
>>srp_Latn<< Vivaldi has written many musical works for the bassoon.
>>srp_Latn<< United States Secretary of State John Kerry broke his right femur in a bicycle accident in France on Sunday.
Where there's a lot of midwives, there's a lot of kids.
It sounds simple, I know.
Tom looked very confused.
The results were incredible.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
The brakes are creaking.
Have you fully recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom spoke very loudly.
Don't move!
>>bos_Latn<< The accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I drop that?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I'd known Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
It's useless.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
>>srp_Latn<< The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the left side is in New York City.
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be somewhat more modest this year.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
>>srp_Latn<< Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who spares words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house for dinner yesterday.
Look at the size of it!
It's true.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy one.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom's out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have gotten involved with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I’ll write it.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
One should not judge a man by his appearance.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the email!

Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
I'm a little worried right now.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?

Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?

I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's worked his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
Tom will live.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.

I'm really upset about it.
Tom's alone.
Whatever you do, don't laugh.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?
I don't understand why Tom would want to do that.

At this stage of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent journalist's opinion of ours. You know it and I know it.

I regularly get my own salary in order to keep my honest opinion out of the newspapers that I work for. Many of you would also be paid so much for similar things, and any of you

Haven't you done enough?
Tom can't do anything about it.
What school did you go to?
We managed to escape just in time.
Did you write a letter to Tom?
>>bos_Latn<< Can you crack an egg with one hand?
Tom made an appointment.
I might need some help.
Tom's caused a lot of trouble.
They never spoke to us.
We'll stop by tonight.
You promised you'd help me.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
I think it's really important.
What are you doing again?
Can you make it?
It happened right here.
Hopefully it will be dry weather.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Victory or death!
>>srp_Latn<< Tom's design saved the company millions of dollars.
>>bos_Latn<< The archaeologist explores the old Roman ruins.
I really like your music.
I don't like it.
Begin.
I'm worried about this mole.
That's enough for now.
You won't believe what happened to me today.
Tom's not bad.
It's her first day of school.
I've never noticed that before.
I could be a suspect.
You and I have a history.
I remember.
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
Have you seen Tom's room?
I'm waiting for my mom.
Tell Tom what Mary did.
I've seen enough so far.
Do you have cheaper rooms?
Tom felt excluded.
I need an honest girl.
The apple fell from the tree.
Can I have a glass of wine?
Did Tom find them?
He's got a big mouth.
Tom asked Mary to answer the phone.
Tom's tightened the crank.
Take a closer look.
When was the last time we met?
Did you write this?
They're being evacuated.
Let's have a drink.
I could talk to Tom.
Tom may not have a choice.
What am I missing here?
It's too easy.
We had a little drink.
I admire your courage.
I'll probably be here all afternoon.
I'm the only one who can do it.
Ignore them.
I panicked.
Don't go in that room.
No words needed.
Tom's old school.
I am a citizen of the world.
That gave Tom an idea.
Tom was sweeping the floor.
What are you gonna do today?
What a beautiful car!
I need to get my hair cut.
I checked some things out.
Tom's not afraid of us.
She's a hundred years old.
I want to meet Maria.
I can't answer you right now.
Put your hands on your head!
I come in peace.
How deep?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
I do.
Are my ears red?
The book is missing chapters two, five and thirteen.
I don't know who they are.
I'm not afraid of getting old.
He has a deep voice.
Get out of there.
Forget him.
I didn't like it very much.
Do you know who killed Tom?
I'm not a traitor.
What are you hiding now?
I'm a pretty honest guy.
I doubt Tom will ever come back.
Everything's gonna be okay in the end, and if it's not okay, it's not over.
I'm proud of my family.
The horse got scared and ran away.
Are you involved in this?
Please, give it to me.
Why can't you stay?
You're my friend.
I didn’t want to disappoint my parents.
I think what Tom did was intentional.
I'm still awake.
I'm immune.
Tom's car has a hundred horsepower.
You're not allowed in that room.
Tom was wearing black jeans and a white T-shirt.
Works for me.
I actually really like it.
Sapporo is the fifth largest city in Japan.
I asked you last night.
Don't say a word!
I was afraid to ask because I didn't want to look stupid.
It was a good day.
We're never going back there.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Tom is right this time.
Have you seen Tom's room?
What did you both do?
>>srp_Latn<< The biggest challenge the project will face is the availability of workers with the abilities needed for the project to flourish.
I'll learn a lot from you.
We'll never get back there.
I'm happy about it.
What year is your car?
Pass it along, Tom.
I hope you like it.
Give me a break.
Tom can't write well.
He left a few minutes ago.
Keep working.

Can you disarm the bomb?
He was late for school, as usual.
Well, things like that happen.
Tom's a wonderful kid.
How would you translate that?
That was horrible.
There are a lot of lions in Africa.
Who cares?
I'm a really simple guy.
Am I safe now?
I could kill you right now.
Am I ever wrong?
Be careful what you wish for, it might come true.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Are you involved in this?
For example, parents should teach their children how to be gentle.
Tom was sitting behind me.
It's dark.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Thank you for the warm words.
What am I doing here?
I can't believe you lied to me.
We've already decided that.
How exciting!
I've been looking for you.
>>srp_Latn<< Frost caused great damage to the crops.
Mary is a spender when it comes to money.
Just tell me you're okay.
I didn't know you were worried.
Where will we meet?
Tom's recovered.
Tom will be here for a few days.
Come out with us.
Tom writes better than me.
He likes to turn a mosquito into a donkey.
This isn't your problem, it's mine.
I'm only a first year.
I've had a very bad day.
I saw a mouse.
Let me sit down.
What have you got there?
It's great.
Who are you trying to trick?
Bears are pretty dangerous.
It's obviously a typo.
Put it on Tom's tab.
He lied to us.
It's finally Friday.
I already ordered it.
Have you ever seen one?
Tom knows what's coming.
The doctor did what he had to do without the little princess even being heard.
Oh, thanks.
Sitting all day and looking at the computer screen is bad for you.
Tom threw in the disk.
I say it all the time.
I'm not signing that.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
>>srp_Latn<< He lashes out at Tom with arguments.
If you try, you will succeed.
What's the name of that restaurant?
We're done talking for now.
Tom hates your guts.
They tortured Tom.
Have you seen Tom's room?
I'm actually a nice guy.
Haven't you done enough?
My kids don’t have their own rooms.
Yours was better.
You should have killed them when you had the chance.
To upgrade the firmware, go to the download page and drag the latest version.
Come in, Tom.
We're both rich.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Tom will wait.
Does that happen often?
He's always unhappy.
It really is.
Did you see me dance?
I hate the smell of onions.
Don't call me when I'm in the office.
Tom hasn't taken anything but water since last night.
Please tell me I'm right.
My wife, who grew up in Norway, has made it clear from the very beginning that it is no longer relevant for a woman to run around her husband all day.
I bought a book.
There's no need to worry about that.
I want to see you.
I'm not getting anywhere today.
Something wonderful happened today.
You're not rational.
Let it go, Tom.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
How long is the Nile River?
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Let's stretch our legs.
Are you done?
>>srp_Latn<< It should be able to be done.
Tom hesitated for a moment.
I'm relaxed.
The sun is a star.
Where's your school?
You'll probably never see me again.
We haven't had enough yet.
You underestimated me.
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
He's a criminal, you know that?
Tom is getting married next month.
For what?
Are we safe now?
I remember something about that.
I don’t want to try to predict the future.
Sometimes it's too late to apologize.
Am I welcome here?
You can sit next to me.
Are you ready?
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
My husband lost his job.
Don't lie.
I've always wondered this.
There goes our bus.
You are contradicting yourself.
Do you think these letters are worth saving?
The house is small but beautiful.
I'll pass.
Aren't you done yet?
I really like your music.
How insightful!
How did I miss this?
I'm leaving work early today.
Are you ready?
Tom and his family moved to Australia.
Tom's the only one who can do this.
I must say, I envy you.
We have to be quiet.
Maria turned down the offer because she thought she'd be better off at the bank.
Tom couldn't say anything else.
I baked bread.
I hope you like it.
I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't commit suicide.
You were made for me.
Are you busy here?
We're out of food.
Mary made her own wedding dress.
How is married life?
It works.
I didn't care.
We're surviving.
This building will be built in the city.
Don't fight.
Everyone knows I don't love Tom.
Tom signed the cover of his new diary.
I can't even imagine that.
I have no intention of changing.
I'm getting good at it.
They voted.
Who are you coming with?
I have confidence in you.
It’s amazing how many sentences you can make with five words.
I exaggerated.
Everyone has their price.
We're gonna have so much fun.
He's not social.
Tom had no such problems.
The pie Tom made was delicious.
Don't shout.
>>bos_Latn<< The Boston Globe gave the film a bad review.
I'd like to try this.

I haven't written anything in months.
Are we safe here?
Orange juice is the most popular juice in America.
It won't pass me
We need to talk about this in private.
They stuck together.
Enjoy it while you still can!
Why is Tom wearing a coat?
Start counting.
I sing well.
That says a lot about you.
Tell Tom to try harder.
Tom won't let us do that.
Life has become very difficult.
Tom was my only son.
It's real.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to.
Maybe Tom isn't hungry.
I always think about it.
I should never have listened to you.
Tom wanted to be okay.
I have to get used to it first.
Could you repeat that, please?
Don't you think you should tell Tom about this?
Tom eats chocolate almost every day.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
Don't talk.
I could come with you.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
It used to be quiet here.
I will not try to predict the future.
This is very easy!
We weren't tired at all.
I love bread.
You're the great love of my life.
Sending these letters won't take long.
You look pale.
Try it.
We'll stop by tonight.
Fate shuffles the cards, and we play.
Emily and Melanie are English.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
>>bos_Latn<< We ask questions to the teacher every day.
I could go there now.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
I'm really looking forward to being here.
What's up, Tom?
Tom's going through a midlife crisis.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
You bastard!
Stop talking.
I can't forget that.
Who's knocking at the door?
I've been waiting.
This money will really help.
Everything is the same before the law.
From the moment he saw him, his heart stopped.
I don't understand the problem.
You must be new here.
Please come.
Is breakfast included in the price?
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Just give Tom a second.
Tell Tom to try harder.
I wish I'd known Tom couldn't speak French.
I already ordered it.
Check it out.
Are you done doing the dishes?
I always thought it was weird.
The ring is tight.
All we know is that Tom is guilty.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Tom bowed his head.
>>srp_Latn<< We have therefore set up a small portable hut that can be divided in two and can be driven anywhere.
Six divided by two is three.
I'd like you to sleep over.
Let's get acquainted!
The disadvantage is being ugly.
That can't be true.
Please don't say that.
I already knew the truth.
I'm really happy about it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Bad weather didn't let me go.
Tom hired a private investigator to follow Mary.
I don't like Tom's writing style.
I'm sure Tom will miss me a lot.
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt you.
My French isn't that good yet.
Can't you see Tom's upset?
He's French.
I think maybe we were too aggressive.
We're never going back there.
No one knows what she's turned into.
Fish is good for you.
What are you going to do this summer?
I'm a beginner.
I'm used to it.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.
Tom got on the bus.
You've been very quiet.
Get him.
Come and see me after work.
How did I miss this?
That boy talks like an adult.
You're staring at the TV again instead of doing your homework!
I need a haircut.
I think I'll be back in about thirty minutes.
Have you ever wanted to live on an island?
No one cares why Tom is a vegetarian.
Tom's pretty secretive.
Did you eat something?
Thomas is easily frightened.
I'll try everything once.
Tom taught me how to read.
There's a math test tomorrow.
Laughter is contagious.
They sell fish and meat.
I recognized him at first sight.
I've never worn a nightgown in my life.
We'd better get ready.
I'm into her.
Tom just told me the opposite.
You're the boss.
He took Jane out to dinner.
Who broke the cup?
You're wasting your time.
What Tom said doesn't apply to this situation.
There are several reasons.
I'm really proud of it.
Stop worrying so much.
I didn't care.
I'm really happy about it.
We missed Tom so much.
I'm not ashamed of it.
They'll know what to do.
We failed.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
Are you saying you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I don't buy it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?
Everyone says I look like my dad.
Come early so we can talk about our plans.
Tom, do you prefer dogs or cats?
He looks young for his age.
I will always remember your advice.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
Who are you trying to trick?
Me and all my brothers share a room.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like that diamond's real.
What have you done now?
I'm sure you can do that.
You can't go in that room.
How old are you really?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You tried.
>>srp_Latn<< There was a new snow avalanche on the road in Ecescaret in Oda municipality in Hordaland on Tuesday night and it is not known if anyone was trapped in the avalanche.
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix the car on my own.
Open up!
Please hurry.
Tom nodded his head.
Do we need to tell anyone?
He's turning blue from the cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom thought.
His memory loss is more of a psychological than a physical problem.
He died.
He started yelling.
Tom could be better.
Tom got fat.
The spider took your car.
So what if it's true?
He was ahead of his time.
Don't bother.
It meant a lot to me.
The effect was quite different from what we intended.
Aren't you done yet?
I’ll have to think about that question,
Tom was talking about music.
There were so many people on the train, I had to stand.
I don't have homework today.
Tom and Mary are getting along fine.
When can Tom come home?
In the window glass I see a reflection of my face.
Go talk to Tom.
I was thinking about my family.
You could have spared me coming here if you'd told me I shouldn't have been here today.
This will make it a lot easier for us.
I've been gone too long.
Is it true you're going to study in Boston?
Tell me where you live.
Let's go over it again.
Whatever you do, don't leave the toilet seat up.
Are we going to see Tom again?
You'll have to ask Tom.
That should save us some money.
He worked 10 hours non-stop.
This one's pretty cool.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Tom will probably still be angry.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I'm not buying it.
That's a fake, isn't it?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Will we ever see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.
He accepted that he was a monster.
Can you cook?
Are we starting soon?
You can't go in that room.
You know I don't like eggs.
Go ahead.
The first step is the hardest.
>>srp_Latn<< Mary read the entire 321 page manual in her breath.
How old is this plane?
I just got here.
What eye hurts?
How old are you?
Did I drop that?
It would take me forever to explain everything.
I haven't worked for many years.
What a beautiful house!
Can you take me home?
What do you have in mind?
It's getting dark.
Don't get in Tom's way.
I really like to exercise.
You have to go to school.
That book costs 3,000 yen.
I just started working here today.
She doesn't like being told what to do.
Fashions age and die.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
Tom never forgave me for doing that.
We're both not as rich as we'd like to be.
Tom plays the piano very well.
Essentially, my dear Watson.
History is written by the winners.
I'm deeply ashamed.
>>srp_Latn<< The writer of the book The Last of the Mohicans, James Fenimore Cooper was the first nature conservation fighter.
We should start over.
>>srp_Latn<< He has extensive experience and his competence has branched out into several areas.
That's enough!
I bought a lot of things.
I'm devastated.
I assumed you were busy.
It's clear.
Keep digging.
What's all the fuss about?
>>bos_Latn<< Tom's confidence is shattered when his boss takes him down in front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried at all.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that for me?
I probably won't watch this.
Come in.
Did I call you?
Most people are afraid to set a big goal for themselves because of the fear that they will never reach it.
I'm naughty.
I do.
That's all I care about.
>>srp_Latn<< They sat on the grass, played ukulele and sang.
I can't imagine life without books.
This building is blue.
I could eat a horse.
It's a really nice day out there.
This must be important.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom could speak French.
It is the third largest city in Serbia.
What year was your car built?
Sit still.
He's a tall boy.
I'm the one who solved the problem.
Where are they going?
Does Tom know about this?
What do I tell them?
I can't sleep at all.
They didn’t manage to do the same in the second half.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
Study hard.
It takes a lot of imagination to try to add a new sentence here.
Things might have turned out better if you hadn't gone there.
I checked.
Finish this.
He came to see you yesterday.
Tom's having a bad day.
Don't answer that.
Is there a red rose?
I'd like to leave.
Stop trying to make me feel bad.
>>bos_Latn<< Pride tends to become hubris, which is a close relative of folly.
How long will Tom last?
The rainy season begins in June.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I changed my schedule.
I wish I could paint like that.
Tom was waiting for me.
Shut up!
Tom says this is absurd.
I never regretted it.
We limit luggage to 10 kilos apiece.
We're never going back there.
Years have passed.
>>srp_Latn<< They established an Air Joint Command where the Director and Chief of Staff were, respectively, from the Navy and Army.
Tom took his ukulele and started singing.
Will we ever see Tom again?
Let's consider the worst that can happen.
Walk slowly.
Let's try.
This place is a mess.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they don't think she's good enough for me.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning without finishing his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm so sorry, Tom.
Such a state of affairs cannot be tolerated.
We've never played football before.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
It's so bright.
When's the meeting?
I could go there now.
I'm stubborn.
The lie got him in trouble when his boss found out the truth.
He looks good for his age.
I really like my team members.
What did you both do?
We're in trouble now.
It looked so delicious.
I have a rock in my shoe.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.
He asked me to help him.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom has a younger sister, Mary.
I could have used that.
I was very excited.
Don't shout.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I saw Tom die.
You're in better shape than I am.
How so?
I'll do my best to find them.
I could lose my license.
Tom told me what to do.
I know exactly what I need to do.
Tom's on a trip.
We'll let you know as soon as we find out.
She told me everything last night.
What can I do?
Was I really that happy?
The fuse's blown.
I can't fight it anymore.
I could lose my pension.
Tom can type really fast.
Sometimes she writes to her son.
Don't talk.
It happened right here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Tom's worried about getting lost.
I think it's best to be polite.
Africa is the cradle of humanity.
Tom has high moral standards.
My favorite teacher was Jackson.
I’m not the only one who didn’t like this movie.
Don't you remember the question?
I like it when it's cold.
Don't jump!
I didn't know.
This one's pretty cool.
We did everything we could.
We just need one chance.
I think Tom likes baseball.
What are your ambitions?
I'm sympathetic.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
I was surprised by Tom’s response.
Do you speak Greek?
Am I a suspect?
Tom's a stickler, isn't he?
Better a kiss in the woods than ten in the hand.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
You need to speak up.
Tom lost his job.
Tom's thrilled.
Did you have lunch?
How much is this gonna cost me?
I'm a hero.
For every male character, there is a female version.
Are you talking about us?
>>srp_Latn<< Mary felt hurt when her children could not make an effort to contact her for March 8.
Tom was saving money to buy a car.
I'm not at all surprised.
How much money do we need?
>>srp_Latn<< This model can be combined with any color.
It's June 18th and Muriel's birthday.
I just got here.
You just need to exercise.
I was so busy with Tatoeb again that I almost got dehydrated.
We have to do this.
I know I'm not perfect.
Mary sat on the grass, playing the ukulele.
Before this decision takes effect, no one will lift a finger to resolve this.
Do you have anything to report?
I've always hated doing that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom will talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's speeding up.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
I got in the habit of doing that.
It's not the right choice.
It's all in the report.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
I've met some wonderful people.
I had lunch with him.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try.
Think again.
How's Tom doing at work?
Tom needs a doctor.
I want to be a man again someday.
Why is it so complicated?
What am I doing here?
Tom often wears black.
Do you want to come in?
Maybe I'm missing something here.
Check around.
Our school was founded in 1990.
You can sit next to me.
Danger lurks around every corner.
Are you sure this is safe?
No one agrees with you.
Tom sells cars.
Anyone for a beer?
My father gave me a lot of money.
I'm not used to it.
I'm glad you answered.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I got an idea.
Tom bought the pantyhose.
They will know what to do.
You're definitely crazy.
Are we ready to go?
I'm free.
Three times five is fifteen.
My mother planted flowers in the garden.
Tom is not confused.
I have a feeling he's pretty arrogant.
Tell him I'm innocent.
It's not a new problem.
Have you ever used any of these?
>>bos_Latn<< Her dissertation must be written in English.
I have to go now.
How hard would it be to do that?
Find yourself a place.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
After winning the lottery, she went out shopping.
It's getting harder for me to concentrate.
Show me the pictures!
I think she's from Austria.
Please wait until I'm ready.
It's always like that.
I'm interested.
Louder, please.
Can you talk to Tom for me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep for a few hours.
What happened?
>>srp_Latn<< An intelligence satellite is a military satellite capable of monitoring many activities on the ground, listening in on communication lines, registering the working frequency of radar systems...
I asked you last night.
You're very pretty.
I doubt you'll find it difficult to get a driver's license.
It's a depressing story.
You don't look so good.
I'm glad you're back.
I'm not talking to Tom.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom and Maria play chess with a set of hand-carved chess pieces supposedly made of ivory.
If an account already exists, a system will work that allows you to receive and send emails.
Go talk to Tom.
I'm confident.
Why don't you take off your coat?
I'm really proud of it.
I think we should focus on other things.
Did your girlfriend like the flowers?
I'm a little new at this.
This should work.
Nancy's from London.
I'll call.
It is the third largest city in Serbia.
FIFA consists of 209 associations.
Everyone was waiting.
Tom told me he lost his notebook.
We've got enough here.
We banished him from the country.
Tom left his key on the table, as he often does.
I'm homeless.
I thought I'd been stabbed.
I'm just thinking out loud.
I thought you were going to Boston by bus.
Why tell Tom anything?
I could have used that.
I hope I can write two or three songs over the weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
It doesn't mean that something is a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom comes back safely.
I like what you wrote.
Don't bleat.

Tom wants to know if you're planning on coming to his party.
Did you see me dance?
Why would Tom want that?
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
Tom is very idiosyncratic.
I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any harm.
I was the only man in the tourist group, the rest were Arab women living in Istanbul.
Investigate that.
Tom's not the right person for the job.
We have to get better.
They demanded an increase in salary.
Let me see your prescription.
Tom came to help.
Sometimes family feuds spread through generations.
It's all upside down.
Tom thinks fast.
Comments have to be about the topic.
Don't bother.
The program sets the conditions for the development and implementation of projects.
We should start again.
Do you feel okay today?
We won.
Give me the spoon.
Can I find you on Facebook?
I was trying to be nice.
It would be confusing.
Here we are.
You can sit next to me.
That's what pulled the lever.
Tom was a great manager.
Everybody claps.
You just need to practice.
Have you ever milked a cow?
There's a lot of orange fishermen on the river.
You just need to write a few sentences about what you did yesterday.
I didn't get on the train because there were so many people.
Could you please turn off the radio for me?
Come again.
She's walking.
What are you still doing up?
Tom was a scout.
What's all the fuss about?
Tom counted the change.
I studied hard when I was in school.
I turned it down, Tom.
Should we tell someone?
After five hours on the hot sand, he saw on the horizon what looked like a desert mirage.
When are you coming to the station?
Are you being honest?
We'll try it your way.
Are you a maniac?
I'll be better now.
And that's it!
I made apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
Nobody was looking.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could be lying.
Good luck.
I never regretted it.
Tom was angry as hell.
Tom might have a point.
Am I welcome here?
What did you both do?
Don't yell.
What an experience!
Tom's learning to program.
Are we done?
Tom's a little eccentric.
Mary came home from school in tears because her friends teased her.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.
I write very fast.
We all did.
Maybe you're wrong.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I have to pay off my debt.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
His speech was, to put it mildly, a disaster.
We have to save money to buy a new car.
Bad things will happen.
I thought you'd already taken care of it.
What year is your car?
You have to believe it's possible that it's going to change.
She translated her sentence.
Did you even ask Tom to help himself?
I could go there now.
They were all cheering.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive safe.
Let's see.
Do you have perfume?
Don't play the monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
Make such a face that you want to hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.
Tom wanted to know what we were doing.
>>bos_Latn<< When yelling doesn't help, shout louder!
I think you should talk to Tom about it.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom arrived on time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I was reckless.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom wanted to take Mary's phone number, but she refused to give it to him.
I'm beaching someone to do it for me.
You're still inexperienced.
We're gonna have so much fun.
Not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's hot in here.
Have you fully recovered?
Tom was wearing black jeans and a white shirt.
The book cost five dollars.
Is it that simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Listen to this.
What's it worth?
I was lucky to survive the accident.
No one I know goes there anymore because it's too crowded.
I'm learning Korean.
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him again.
I'm glad Tom's gone.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
Drive slow.
Tom must have had a key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came.
Tom probably hates me, too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray kitty, please, don't purr.
Just give me a chance.
What makes you smile?
How many people were there?
Everybody's quiet.
Pass me the sugar, please.
I'm stunned.
I want a sword!
Don't talk.
Remarkable!
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
Tom had a little help.
Tom was more than ready.
I don't think about it.
You are average students.
Tom is as old as Mary.
Why don't you come by sometime?
We all did.
What have you done now?
Answer me right now.
Why are you mad at me?
Don't forget to do your homework.
It would be nice if you'd wait for me.
They were sitting in a circle.
I want to meet Tom.
We're just in time.
Norwegian prisons are the most luxurious in the world.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
It happened.
You need a hobby.
Keep working.
I'm terrible with kids.
We need to get another bottle of wine.
Where did you find this knife?
The news came out of the blue.
I have to go now.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'm not married to Tom.
It was a little weird.
What does this word mean?
I'm bluffing.
Tom promises the Scots hills and valleys.
I'm not sure when Tom will arrive.
It's not connected.
Tom used to be afraid of dogs.
We finally have all the names of the fields in Norwegian and it will be of great help to our users.
Tom will talk.
I want to see you!
It's on your left.
Where's the bathroom?
That's not like you.
I'll call her tonight.
This will make our job a lot easier.
Tom got involved with people who had a very bad influence on him.
Where did I leave my keys?
I got 100 points on my math test.
Am I in love?
How do you know so much?
I'm replaceable.
It's up to you to choose.
>>srp_Latn<< The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by Tom Berners Lee.
Maybe Tom will agree to do it.
Don't put your elbows on the table.
It's not over until it's over.
It's a big day, son!
Tell me what you wrote.
Keep an eye on him.
Be home by 7:30.
That's not all we have.
Stay where you are, Tom.
I recommend you visit the British War Museum in London.
For his birthday, Dan got a cat figurine for good luck from a work colleague.
I know everything.
Bring the food.
Are you free on Sunday?
That's a fake, isn't it?
Oh, thanks.
I can't just give up.
Do you like it or not?
Life goes on!
"Do you like costumes?" "I hate costumes!"
I liked that one.
It must be scary.
Men want to feel important.
Can we just start over?
Do you know what this phrase means?
Looks like he lives in Britain.
A boom-boom is an example of an ideophone.
You pay me well.
Tom said okay.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom opened a new restaurant, but failed to make money from it during the first twelve months.
Tom's right this time.
You lose.
A lot's happened.
Bergen is the second largest city in Norway.
I'm out.
What's on your mind?
I gave them an anniversary present.
This is not drinking water.
Tom showed me how to read.
Was I really that happy?
Is it just me?
That's how I figured it out.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom has written several hundred articles and several books.
Come here.
What do you mean by that?
Tom wrote down Mary's phone number.
There's a good chance we'll win.
The meeting lasted an hour.
I can only walk three miles at a time.
You told me not to lie.
Tom was a garbage man.
Beer's good.
Don't you ever do this again.
Tell Tom what Mary did.
I'm naked.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Don't be scared.
Tom used to be afraid of snakes.
He has a big family.
>>srp_Latn<< The effect of climate change is much less pronounced on Antarctica than in the northern polar regions.
Tom's blinds are down.
Tom will cry.
Tom wanted to give a very special gift to his girlfriend.
What is the retail price of eggs?
They're broken.
I know you don't want to talk to me.
Can you talk to Tom?
He has a big family.
You look a little better today.
At least Tom's honest.
We will live like kings.
I didn't write this.
I'm not ready to go.
I need you to stay with me.
I'm glad you answered.
Nine FIFA officials have been arrested and charged with bribery and corruption.
You said you were ready.
They couldn't escape.

I'm early.
Does Tom have any experience?
That's really beautiful.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Food is essential for survival.
These are my best friends.
I made a complete fool of myself.
I've been there before.
I'm mad at Tom.
Can you hand me the remote?
Her name was Maria.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom was probably born in Australia.
Tom's stalled.
If you don't understand, you have to say it.
My parents died.
It's really nice.
I'll yell.
Don't cheat.
Second of all!
Tom broke something again.
It's not that simple.
Do you want to keep it?
We'll take the next one.
I don't need directions.
Go upstairs.
It doesn't matter.
I'll teach you how to write.
>>bos_Latn<< The mileage depends on the conditions on the road.
Don't fight.
What have you done now?
The sun was shining, and yet it was cold.
Maybe it's not possible.
Tom will remember.
Tom could get lost.
He begged me to help him.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom used to be a football player.
I owe you an apology.
I pissed him off.
Tom will go.
Tom spoke in a strong voice.
>>bos_Latn<< The investigation found that despite his denial, the boss had to know everything about illegal developments in his company.
We might as well go.
There's no freebies at Grandma's.

Would you rather have tea?
What is the longest river in the world?
Just stay out of this.
We need your help.
What does this mean in Arabic?
Is Tom sitting here?
A plastic cup is better than one made of real glass.
I laughed.
Just give Tom a second.
I gave them an anniversary present.
I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
Everyone tells me I'm weird.
I'll get some rice for my collage.
I'm very proud of it.
What did you tell Tom?
We strongly recommend that you use one of the three predefined regimens to achieve optimal results.
That's encouraging news.
You shouldn't be going out right now.
It wasn't fun, so I went home early.
Have you ever written a computer program?
Projects like this never end.
I prefer apples to oranges.
Here's a secret.
Could it be true?
Don't let it get to your head.
I really want to find something to eat.
What year is your car?
You're absolutely right.
I apologize to those of you who may have been offended; that was not my intention.
I told you it would work.
I'm tired.
Nothing can stop me.
Criminals should be punished.
Who knows what that was?
It's been a long time.
Tom seems a little squeamish.
I shot a bear.
I've been looking for you.
Tom was severely beaten.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote for myself.
You didn't commit a serious offense.
I don't like to write.
You ask me questions that you already know the answers to.
I didn't see anything.
>>bos_Latn<< Several men get angry at Tom at the bar and Tom tells them that he is not afraid to face them.
Did Tom really want Mary to do that?
>>srp_Latn<< Tom failed to present any evidence to support his statement.
I'm not that happy.
Anyone want a beer?
If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
I won't say anything.
You're good to everyone.
Come and see me after work.
How do I call a taxi?
Tom signed Mary as a check payer.
Open it.
Tom is very sophisticated.
When you start, you'll never stop.
That's really nice.
Neither can I.
Do you like roller coasters?
Everything's gonna be all right in the end, and if it's not all right, then it's not over.
Let's go, folks.
Are you being sarcastic?
Where did you find this knife?
Speak for yourself, Tom.
We shouldn't make fun of others.
Have you fully recovered?
I'm proud of it.
Where did I put the keys?
There is an obvious difference between the good and the best.
I don't sing.
Am I ever wrong?
Mind your own business!
She licked the spoon.
What did you conclude?
We know that's not true.
We're all gonna die.
Tom has two kids.
Is that far from here?
I'm very happy about that.
Tom had no choice but to laugh and endure.
Cigarettes cost two marks.
I know I'm not perfect.
This is how it was supposed to be.
Tom got nervous because of you.
What's wrong with you?
We haven't met yet.
I'm not old.
Can I take your dictionary?
Tom ate a whole box of chocolates by himself.
Can we do this later?
The truth must be told.
Do you like costumes?
Haven't you done enough?
What do you know about me?
I think Tom's very smart.
Does that mean you love me?
This will never end.
We have a serious problem.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Explain it in simple words.
Tom only drinks decaf.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
We need to get another bottle of wine.
Now we need the truth.
Tom sleeps all the time.
I really like your music.
This is Copacabana!
I'm learning a few languages.
When you hurt others, you hurt yourself.
You're dead.
You can't make us leave.
Tom said I could stay.
Who else uses this room?
You'll save time if you listen carefully to my instructions.
He was tired of reading.
Can we order now?
We can't stop here.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom did not for a moment think of trying to convince Mary to do so.
Hey, give me a chance.
>>bos_Latn<< There is also an ethical question that has been asked about this.
It just happened again.
They all survived.
Bad things will happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of it.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I completely disagree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than I do.
I can't do anything today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom hit the switch.
My children need me.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn’t read it because it was too small.
I didn't wash my hair.
Are you hungry?
Tom is still frustrated.
If you try, you will succeed.
We have enough seats for everyone.
It was a false alarm.
Tom's learning programming.
Anyone can get lice.
Tom wouldn't let me answer Mary's question.
Whenever I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
I want Tom gone by noon.
Tom looked stunned.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
It won't help you if you worry.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go to see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
I'll take the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking the day off.
Are you blaming me?
That ruined the mood at the table yesterday.
I thought you were going to Boston by bus.
Tom still has a little time.
I might not sleep tonight.
You're wasting your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had any trouble falling asleep.
It's locked.
I'll think of something.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care of yourself!
I will not try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this hour?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is it all settled now?
Please send me the doctor's bill.
What's this about?
Have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new at this.
I improvised.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No. What's the matter?"
That's what they both like.
You and I need to talk.
You were spying on me.
The pen I'm writing with belongs to Tom.
Where did you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We help each other.
Tom and Mary remained good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom smiled.
I'm scared.
In what name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom's the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's going.
I didn't spend anything.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
Tom loves sports.
Tom took off his wig.
I guess I was right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom ready.
Stay away from my girl.
I'm sorry I even tried.
I'm not bitter at all.
Jumi is one of my friends.
He just needed a little time.
I didn't think Tom would do that.
Sorry I'm so late.
Mary began to take off her clothes.
As above, so below.
Life without love makes no sense.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
I'm firmly against this.
You underestimate me.
>>bos_Latn<< Tom almost never makes mistakes when writing in French.
Police did not rule out the possibility of suicide.
This was on the list.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Come here, young man.
This should work.
The hard work paid off.
Tom asked me if he should help Mary or not.
I was just thinking about you.
>>srp_Latn<< Signal lights are used to transmit Morse code.
It doesn't go any further than Main Street, but you can get number 31 from there.
The worst is yet to come.
I was home last night.
Men talk about women all the time.
A lot of people already hate you.
If I'd known your e-mail address, I'd have written to you.
Tom could kick anybody's ass.
I'm doing the best I can here.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
The government has fallen.
Tom took a sip of wine.
This will take forever.
I'm so excited.
I'm here to play baseball.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Don't stop.
Close the window.
Tom missed the target.
I completely disagree with you.
Get away.
Let me do it again.
They live there.
>>bos_Latn<< This book will help you write effectively.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I work in Milan.
Come back in a day.
It had a very different effect than intended.
I was surprised by Tom’s response.
Everybody's laughing.
I loved going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all stopped.
The book is sold out.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
Tom needs the truth.
I loved going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You were supposed to be my friend!
People need to stop hating.
I have no doubt he will succeed.
I never advised you to do that.
I don't intend to change.
Tom started the car.
My grandmother, after her father, is enjoying a tea ceremony.
She smiled.
They've misled everyone.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it a secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
In accordance with our rules, all participants must show their ID, registration papers and license when inspecting.
Tom looks like a little girl.
Do we have one of those?
How do you put that together?
We don’t get along well with our neighbors.
Do you like to write?
They decided to get married.
What does Tom drink?
Exercise has many benefits.
That's what the learned argue about.
He's trying.
Tom told me his father passed away.
Tom told me I should stay home.
It's too loud for me here.
I want to be sweeter.
>>srp_Latn<< Tom has a strong German accent.
Tom asked Mary to scratch him on the part of his back that he couldn't reach.
He's over there.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Just stay with me.
I forgot to write my name on the exam.
Does Tom have a key?
Tom's prepared.
You always do.
>>srp_Latn<< In chess, there are situations where it pays to sacrifice a figure to gain an advantage in the long run.
Young children should learn to empathize with animals.
You're not done yet?
You're not the one who died.
It's hard to imagine.
Are you being sarcastic?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
She's walking.
My mother loves music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw a sketch of your house.
Tom put down his drink.
I'm pretty shocked by this.
The pantry is empty.
Tom decided against it.
I'm grateful.
I couldn't have done this without your help.
Don't answer that.
If you would do that for me, it would help a lot.
He was bare-chested and barefoot.
Tom might be honest.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They need to drink water.
Now I'm a little worried.
What's in it, Tom?
Help yourself.
I'm completely penniless.
Tom hates Mary.
Can I borrow your pen for a second?
Don't let it get into your head.
My right arm is numb.
That's enough!
I sell coffee.
Tom worked with me once.
Stop it!
Tom jumped into the water and didn't take his clothes off.
I'm a little crazy.
I'm happy to say yes.
Each bird flies its own flock.
Do you want to see a total solar eclipse that will leave Svalbard in the dark on March 20, 2015?
I sleep soundly.
Did you eat something?
Emma was very conspicuous at the party.
What did you just write in your notebook?
I know it's illegal.
I studied hard when I was in school.
They wanted to punish me.
Don't talk.
You look fat.
Do you live there?
I'm kidding.
Why am I here?
They are as different as heaven and earth.
Tom was all alone.
The cavalry has arrived.
Everyone's asleep.
Tom begged Mary not to tell his parents.
Would you like to come with me?
Tom's family lives in Boston.
I liked that one.
>>srp_Latn<< Al lived in the Soviet Union, the one large and multi-national, in the large Tver region, by size equal to several English countries.
Tom can be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What have you done to me?
Don't jump!
>>srp_Latn<< When he was six years old he learned to type on a typewriter, and he told the teacher that he should not learn to write by hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'm gonna go outside and eat.
Can I talk to you outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I did a good job.
Am I safe now?
Please write it down.
We didn't have this planned for you.
Tom's selling cars.
He started screaming.
Tom was visibly shaken.
Did you see who it was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We kissed last night.
Was I really that happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't often hear someone buy a hat for a thousand dollars.
Come here.
That's what I'm used to.
Do you doubt me?
Tom's worked his whole life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what they both like.
Something's come up.
Help, police, help!
I already ordered it.
I'm sure Tom will miss me a lot.
What's your name?
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this mess.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
>>bos_Latn<< The government fell after a vote in parliament.
I want to be a swimmer.
Are we going to see Tom again?
When did you have time to do that?
I don't have many friends.
We don't know what tomorrow will bring.
What was the first instrument you learned to play?
I'm stunned.
There's nothing left.
Have you ever written a computer program?
I'm not losing hope.
I have a plan.
You took my place.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
Do you think Tom would want to go camping with us next weekend?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Drive safe.
Did I ask you?
How long did Tom stay?
People tell me things.
To health!
Tom's in his pajamas.
Did Tom believe your story?
I was so tired that I went to bed early.
It's hard.
Tom thought I was lying.
I don't want anything from you.
How's that going?
Don't argue with me.
Tom is also a salesman.
I want to feel important.
We'd give anything to make sure that didn't happen.
I think Tom needs help.
Switzerland needs better apples.
Are you involved in this?
They're all standing.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
You can never gild a piece of shit so it doesn't stink.
Don't rush it.
No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'll leave early today.
Are my ears red?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
>>srp_Latn<< Employees can be motivated by good, fair wages, a chance to work in a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and chances of advancement.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed.
That's encouraging news.
Pass the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt you'll find it hard to get a driver's license.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Is it all settled now?
>>bos_Latn<< How can it be that mathematics, which is nevertheless merely the product of human thought independent of experience, is so astonishingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Looks like Tom's an honest person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had a quick lunch.
He risked it.
His wife patched up his shirt.
Someone told me about it.
Swallow your pride!
To change the red meat, I cooked turkey breasts in mushroom sauce for tonight.
I'm always cranky.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I've always liked horror movies.
Something just came up.
I couldn't stop crying.
You've gained weight.
They're not mine.
I double the prices.
Could you do that?
>>srp_Latn<< A video recording of the interview was made and was released throughout the Internet.
Tom got drunk and drowned his sorrow, after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we take a break for a while?
Go take a look.
Tom was just about to say something.
It's over.
Is it true Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Is that what you think?
I didn't do that either.
Do you have anything to report?
I say it all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I just got here.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why not?
Tom let out a muffled sigh.
There's a lot of work I have to do before I can go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when it's spoken fast.
It's almost half past three.
They'll know.
Tom bought a pair of black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
>>srp_Latn<< Zurich is considered one of the major financial centers.
That's a very rare one.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not in a hurry.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not stretch out.
It's not getting worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a tough job.
I'm happy we won.
You can't go in that room.
"Are you feeling better?" "No, I'm getting worse."
Everything is fleeting, but good memories live on.
I was in the mountains.
It's heavy.
Which is easier?
Did you wash the dishes?
We had a big fight.
It was a drop that poured over the glass.
He doesn't like us.
We'd have saved time if we'd gone down Park Street.
A police officer arrested him for drunk driving.
It's gonna be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife's not sharp.
We hope people will like it.
We all have a price.
That gave Tom an idea.
I got lucky.
Nobody knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks there's something wrong with some politicians.
Where is Tehran?
>>bos_Latn<< Run over any obstacle with this monster of a truck!
>>srp_Latn<< Mary spends a lot of time on the phone, sending messages and emails to friends.
He always wears dark clothes.
Happiness was on our side.
Tom works for his father's company.
I want to help you.
We never lose hope.
Men remain children all their lives.
Now we need the truth.
I'm supposed to be here all afternoon.
Haven't I taught you anything?
Why do you ask?
It's big.
Quick as it is, it's couscous.
Come sit next to me.
I found him a book.
>>bos_Latn<< I was barely able to hide my indignation at her impertinence.
Butter is made from milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
It's getting better.
Do you want to see something specific?
I miss her.
I passed the exam!
Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please don't yell.
Does he still have a fever?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
What have you done to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We will visit you from time to time.
Tom didn't have the courage to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
