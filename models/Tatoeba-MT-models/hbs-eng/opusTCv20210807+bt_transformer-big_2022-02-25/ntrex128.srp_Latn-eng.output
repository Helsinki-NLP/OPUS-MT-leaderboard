Welsh members of the assembly are concerned about "similarity with Muppets"
>>srp_Latn<< Some Members of the Assembly (AM) are outraged by the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
>>srp_Latn<< This came about because the name of the assembly is planned to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all political parties worry that they may become a laughingstock.
A Labour Party member said his party was concerned that the abbreviation "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
>>srp_Latn<< For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means wacky, and pwp means droppings.
A member of the assembly from the Plaid political party said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that MWP is pronounced similar to Muppets.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary commission, which is currently working on the draft law on the introduction of name changes, made the following statement: "The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of the members of the assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
>>srp_Latn<< The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
>>srp_Latn<< In June, the Commission announced the results of public consultations on generally accepted proposals for the appointment of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
>>srp_Latn<< With regard to the title of members of the assembly, the Commission opted for the option of Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the widest support in public consultations.
Members of the assembly are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could give headaches to the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on change within a few weeks.
>>srp_Latn<< Reform laws will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualification of assembly members and a plan of the board system.
>>srp_Latn<< Members of the assembly will eventually vote for their own title during the debate over the said bill.
Macedonians vote to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether they accept the new name of the country "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organised in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of the neighboring northern state is a claim to its territory and has steadfastly opposed its EU and NATO membership requirements.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognise the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent, and the churches of Harlem are fighting for survival.
“The old people I talked to say that there used to be cafes and churches on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“There’s no one or the other today.”
He understands the disappearance of the bar.
“People are different now,” he says.
“The cafés no longer have the role of living quarters from the neighborhoods where people regularly go.”
As far as churches are concerned, he fears that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as executives expect “and sooner or later it will be back to square one.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of the kind of people who would not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that will speed up the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that most of those people who move into these apartment buildings will become their members."
>>srp_Latn<< Both churches built communities made up of whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
>>srp_Latn<< The original white Methodist community moved away in the 1930s.
>>srp_Latn<< A black community performing worship nearby took ownership of the building.
>>srp_Latn<< St. Martin's was taken over by the black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
>>srp_Latn<< The 1939 fire caused major damage to the building, but since Father Johnson's parishioners decided to restore it, they ordered an organ.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the organ “the organ of the poor”.
An expert who played the organ in July called them different: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, said it was the first organ in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger organ at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
>>srp_Latn<< Mr Meriveder stated that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in the last few months in Saint Martin is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of whom were brought in by world leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
>>srp_Latn<< The parish administration - the administrative body of the parish, composed of world leaders - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would seek to transfer costs" to the parish administration, although the parish administration was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
>>srp_Latn<< Some parishioners have complained of non-transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old during lobster hunt in California
>>srp_Latn<< On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving in search of lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
>>srp_Latn<< The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in the town of Encinitas.
>>srp_Latn<< Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he overheard the boys' distress calls, and then rowed along with the group to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just the excitement of the lobster catch, but then “he realized he was yelling ‘She bit me!
It bit me!”
>>srp_Latn<< He was stripped of his entire clavicle," Hamel said he noticed that when he reached the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘The shark is in the water!’”
>>srp_Latn<< The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
>>bos_Latn<< It is not known what type of shark attacked him.
Rescuer Larry Giles said in a press release that a few weeks earlier, the shark had already been spotted in the area, but was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
>>srp_Latn<< Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper part of the hull.
>>srp_Latn<< Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Karlsbad to the Swami's area in the city of Encinitas for 48 hours due to the investigation and security.
>>srp_Latn<< Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Trade Chain Plans to Enter the UK Beauty Market
>>srp_Latn<< Sainsbury's becomes a competition for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores with departmental beauty products in the style of department stores where professional assistants work.
>>srp_Latn<< As part of a significant breakthrough in the UK cosmetic products market which is spinning 2.8 billion pounds, with the figure rising as sales in the fashion and home equipment markets are falling, larger cosmetic products departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will open in more stores next year if they prove to be successful.
Investment in cosmetic products comes from supermarkets finding ways to take advantage of shelf space after lawsuits for TVs, microwaves and home equipment.
The Sainsbury's retail chain has announced it will double its range of cosmetic products to as many as 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
>>srp_Latn<< The existing range of products by L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with areas for certain brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching the Boutique makeup palette to make most products suitable for vegans - as demand for younger customers grows.
>>srp_Latn<< Additionally, the Fragrance Shop perfume store will test outlets at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, a southern part of London, last week, and the second opens in the Selly Oak settlement, Birmingham, later this year.
>>srp_Latn<< Shopping online and switching to the daily supply of small amounts of food in local stores means supermarkets must make an extra effort to attract people to visit them.
>>srp_Latn<< Mike Coop, CEO of the Sainsbury's trade chain, said that the department's outlet would be increasingly reminiscent of self-service as the supermarket chain tries to strike back at sales facilities with large discounts to Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
>>srp_Latn<< The Sainsbury's retail chain has opened Argos outlet departments in hundreds of stores and numerous Habitats departments since it purchased both of these chains two years ago, which it says has increased sales of food products and procurement profitability.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to modernize its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments ended infamy.
>>srp_Latn<< The Sainsbury's retail chain tested a joint venture with Boots Store in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended after taking victory in the division of revenue from pharmaceutical stores in their supermarkets.
>>srp_Latn<< The new strategy takes effect after Sainsbury's sold the pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to the Celesio company, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
>>srp_Latn<< Lloyds was said to have a role in this plan by presenting an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of our beauty department to provide our customers with a better environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at your service to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations make us an indispensable destination for cosmetic products that sets new standards for how to shop."
Peter Jones ‘infuriated’ after pulling Holly Willoughby out of a 11-million-pound deal
Peter Jones, star of Dragons Dan, is “infuriated” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11 million-dollar business with his personal brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
>>bos_Latn<< Willoughby does not have time for their brand of home and accessories Truly.
>>srp_Latn<< This couple's company collaborated with Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old announced her departure on Instagram this morning.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, star of Dragons Dan, by withdrawing at the last minute from the profitable business with their brand to focus on her new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “infuriated” when a TV screen favorite during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that the new offerings costing up to 1.5 million pounds no more time to devote to their home and accessories brand, Truly.
>>srp_Latn<< The company collaborated with Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and was predicted to double Willoughby's estimated fortunes of 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced via Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his cottages.
According to the source, “Holly was putting the Truly brand at the top of its priorities.
This was going to be her long-term plan for the next few decades.
>>bos_Latn<< Her decision to withdraw stunned everyone involved.
>>srp_Latn<< No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch date.
>>srp_Latn<< The warehouse at the Marlow headquarters is stocked with merchandise ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of one of Britain’s most profitable stars, This Morning, could cost the company millions due to large investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home equipment, as well as possible further delays to the launch date.
It could also mark the end of a long friendship.
>>srp_Latn<< Willoughby, who is the mother of three children and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
>>srp_Latn<< In 2016, Willoughby founded Truly with Capov, and in March they were joined by Jones, 52, as the company's CEO.
>>srp_Latn<< These couples spend the holidays together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for the M&S brand and will replace Ent McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity TV channel ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business."
After the harsh words “compassion”
He joked about the criticism in the media over comments that some say are "not worthy of a president" and about the positive attitude of the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump retiring so much?
>>srp_Latn<< Trump said by imitating the voice of a TV commentator.
“I’m not backing out of anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump praised their initial June meeting in Singapore as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
>>srp_Latn<< However, negotiations on denuclearization have died down.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that there was no “appropriate reaction” from the United States to North Korea’s initial disarmament steps.
Instead, he stressed, the United States does not lift sanctions that exert continuous pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are making great progress with North Korea,” he said.
“We were one step away from a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: missile tests have ended, hostages have been freed and the remaining U.S. troops have returned home.
>>srp_Latn<< He defended this unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be a decent president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing there,” Trump said.
>>srp_Latn<< Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia wreak havoc on the island, leaving hundreds dead behind
>>srp_Latn<< After the Lombok Island earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok island's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a precondition for receiving international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international help, so we are facing some difficulties,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pale, it’s still unclear if foreign personnel can work in the field.
>>srp_Latn<< Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Pal to determine whether international agencies will be allowed to participate in providing assistance.
Given the constant earthquakes that shake Indonesia, it is sad how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
>>srp_Latn<< Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other shores.
>>srp_Latn<< The loss of life was also likely contributed to the apparent non-advertising of the tsunami warning siren in Palu even though the warning was in effect.
Travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed on the island of Lombok to assist earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new accident.
>>srp_Latn<< President Yoko Vidodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's aging infrastructure and spared no money for roads and railways.
>>srp_Latn<< However, the lack of funding has hit Mr. Yoko's administration, and he is due to re-election the following year.
>>srp_Latn<< Mr. Yoko also faces pressure creating protracted sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim population have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other crude weapons.
Daniel Staridge, Liverpool player, manages to score a tie against Chelsea
>>srp_Latn<< Daniel Staridge saved Liverpool's Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
>>srp_Latn<< Staridge received a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri on 27 yards from a Chelsea goal when his team was losing 1–0.
First he turned the ball to the left, then kicked it to the far post.
>>srp_Latn<< The ball went high above the goal in the right upper corner of the net.
>>srp_Latn<< She eventually flew over goalkeeper Kep Arizabalaga who jumped to catch her and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to set myself up for the kick, and players like Shaqiri are always playing forward as much as possible, so I just tried to fight for as much time as possible,” he told LiverpoolFC.com.
>>srp_Latn<< I saw Kante approaching, I touched the ball once and just kicked it, without much thought."
>>srp_Latn<< Chelsea led 1–0 at half-time after a goal by Belgian star Eden Azar in the 25th minute.
>>srp_Latn<< The Blue striker returned the ball to Mateo Kovačić on the fifth, and then turned in the middle of the field and ran for half of Liverpool.
>>srp_Latn<< Kovačić exchanged several short kicks in the middle of the field.
>>srp_Latn<< He then directed a brilliant centre-kick, leading Azar to goal.
>>srp_Latn<< Azar overtook the defense and put the final kick with his left foot into the far net alongside Allison Becker, a Liverpool player.
>>srp_Latn<< Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
>>srp_Latn<< Chelsea meet Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Tuesday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
>>srp_Latn<< The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia jumped to 832, according to a statement from the disaster management agency on Sunday morning.
Numerous reports have arrived for people trapped in the rubble of buildings hit by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit Indonesia on Friday and triggered waves up to 20 feet high, a spokesman for the Sutopo Purvo Nugroho news agency said at a news conference.
>>srp_Latn<< The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was buried by the remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
>>srp_Latn<< A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Berkenhead, in Merseyside County.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed to death at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Music on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
>>srp_Latn<< Police called people in the area who had seen or heard anything to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would call everyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead and see or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
>>srp_Latn<< I would also invite all, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a camera on the dashboard to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
>>srp_Latn<< A police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body was found lives in Berkenhead and was found on the property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know this woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
>>srp_Latn<< An investigation is ongoing, and police have stated that they are currently notifying the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Music had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that everyone was banned from entering and exiting the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told they would not be allowed to return for several hours.
>>srp_Latn<< Word got out that a police officer had told a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
She kept saying, “This is terrible.”
>>srp_Latn<< At 2 p.m. two police vans were in a cordon with another van outside.
>>bos_Latn<< Several police officers stood in the cordon overseeing the apartment blocks.
Anyone with information to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and provide a record of 247 as of September 30th.
Cromwell's statue in front of parliament becomes the subject of the latest monument debate over a dispute over "falsifying history"
>>srp_Latn<< Its removal would be poetic justice for its destruction in the style of the Taliban of many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
>>srp_Latn<< However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "madness" and "an attempt to falsify history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “The figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster was an inevitable goal in the ongoing debate on the removal of the statue.
>>srp_Latn<< Cromwell neither issued an order nor enforced iconoclasts during the English Civil Wars.
>>srp_Latn<< Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed because of the work of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
>>srp_Latn<< The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo of Turnicroft testifies to a 19th-century opinion and is part of the historiography of a figure who, according to many, still deserves to be glorified.
Mr. Goldsmith made the following statement to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, consider Cromwell to have defended parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
>>srp_Latn<< The credibility of this description has been the subject of constant debate throughout history.
What is certain is that this conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell as an individual is a recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
>>srp_Latn<< His successes as a Lord Protector titleholder also deserve to be praised and kept from oblivion."
A pig-killer caused fatal injuries to a Chinese farmer.
>>srp_Latn<< According to local media reports a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his last name, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty at a market in the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.
>>srp_Latn<< A pig farm owner is preparing to inject pigs in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
>>srp_Latn<< He reportedly came with a cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning and noticed that the door to the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the pigsty that had blood on its mouth.
>>srp_Latn<< A forensic investigation has confirmed that a 250kg pig caused fatal injuries to a farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” said a relative named Wu, according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Juan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged to neither Juan nor his cousin.
>>srp_Latn<< The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so it wouldn't attack anyone else, while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
>>srp_Latn<< Juan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, there are already recorded cases of swine attacks on humans.
>>srp_Latn<< In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, causing a man critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig held a Welsh farmer pinned to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a farmer from the province of Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can be a “trigger” to them.
“They’re just playing.
They like to nibble, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants will bring widespread downpours to the southwest of the United States
>>srp_Latn<< According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
>>srp_Latn<< However, Rosa will bring showers in the coming days to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States that will lead to flooding.
>>srp_Latn<< Rosa, with winds of 137 km/h, on Saturday from 5 a.m. Eastern time, was a Category 1 hurricane and was located 620 kilometers southwest of the settlement of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
>>srp_Latn<< Meanwhile, a low pressure field is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and heading east, towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push high tropical moisture northwards, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
>>srp_Latn<< Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity due to contact with a low pressure field approaching will lead to widespread showers in the southwest.
The amount of rain from 2.5 to 10 cm in local areas will cause dangerous torrential floods, the spreading of water and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause precipitation of about 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
>>srp_Latn<< It is also expected to rain from 5 to 10 cm in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
>>srp_Latn<< Flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the unrestrained nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely reckless on foot to head into the desert as the threat of tropical rains looms.
Due to heavy rainfall, canyons can turn into frantic rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to tumultuous winds and dust in the air.
>>srp_Latn<< A low pressure field approaching will bring locally heavy rain in certain parts of the southern California coast.
>>bos_Latn<< Rainfall amounts of over 1.5 cm are possible, which can cause minor debris dispersal by water and slippery Augusts.
>>bos_Latn<< It will be the first rain in the region for their rainy season.
Local tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, and on Monday night and Tuesday precipitation will hit the wider area.
>>srp_Latn<< The showers will spread to the area of southwest part of Colorado, southeast part of Utah, northeast part of Arizona and northwest part of New Mexico on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
>>srp_Latn<< In October, large fluctuations in temperature across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, while in tropical regions, fairly warm weather will be maintained.
>>bos_Latn<< This sometimes causes huge differences in temperature over small distances.
>>srp_Latn<< A great example is the dramatic temperature differences in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
>>srp_Latn<< Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees.
The long-lasting summer heat will rise and expand again in the next few days.
>>srp_Latn<< In the greater central and eastern parts of the United States, a warm start is expected in October with a temperature of 27 degrees Celsius in much of the country, from the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
>>srp_Latn<< The temperature in New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television channels on Thursday.
>>srp_Latn<< Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with television outlets terminating a regular Friday programming scheme for last-minute trades: a deal drafted by Arizona Senator, Jeff Flake under which the FBI is to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh had felt her up and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
>>srp_Latn<< Kavanaugh, in glowing testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people watched it Friday, according to a Nielsen report.
>>bos_Latn<< She has counted average television ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
>>srp_Latn<< The figures were not immediately available for other networks that featured it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of viewers in offices.
By comparison, this number of spectators can match the audience that follows the football game of the playoffs or the Oscars.
>>srp_Latn<< The Fox News Channel, with the hosts of the Opinion show who strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, recorded the highest ratings of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing, according to Nielsen Agency.
>>srp_Latn<< ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
>>srp_Latn<< CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen news agency.
This process aroused great interest even after the hearing.
>>srp_Latn<< Flake was a central figure of the drama that took place on Friday.
>>srp_Latn<< After making a statement from the office of a moderate Republican to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, cameras of CNN and CBS television on Friday morning filmed protesters yelling at him while he was trying to take an elevator ride to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood there for a few minutes with his eyes down as they insulted him, which CNN broadcast live.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said to him, ‘You have power, and so many women are helpless.’
>>srp_Latn<< Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he said he had more to bring up at the committee hearing.
>>srp_Latn<< All cable and television outlets broadcast live events hours later when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to forward Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate in full.
>>srp_Latn<< However, Flake said he agreed to it only on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the nominee over the next week, which was insisted upon by a minority of Democrats.
>>srp_Latn<< Flake was partially convinced of this by a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
>>srp_Latn<< After talking to Coons and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
>>srp_Latn<< Flake's choice had weight because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “playing politics” in Brexit case
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with Sunday Times, accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the UK’s future and undermining the national interest.
>>srp_Latn<< British Prime Minister Theresa May is coming to the Conservative Party conference on 29 September 2018 in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Checkers plan for Brexit, calling the proposal for a single UK-EU customs zone "completely meaningless".
>>srp_Latn<< Wade Simms' murder: Police arrest suspect Dajon Simpson for Louisiana University player's death
>>srp_Latn<< Police arrested the suspect in the murder with the gun of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old University of Louisiana basketball player.
Dajon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and placed behind bars on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
>>srp_Latn<< Officials released video footage of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a WAFB channel attached to the CBS network.
>>srp_Latn<< After interrogating Simpson, police stated that he confessed to fatally wounding Wade with a pistol shot.
>>srp_Latn<< He was set bail at $350,000, the lawyer said.
>>srp_Latn<< On Friday, the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report citing a gunshot wound through the head to the neck as the cause of death.
>>srp_Latn<< Credits for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest are credited by the department to the Louisiana State Police Task Force for the capture of fugitives, the state crime lab, the Southern University Police Department, and local residents.
The director of the Louisiana State University athletics department, Joe Alleva, thanked local law enforcement authorities for their “advocacy and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20.
>>srp_Latn<< A six-foot-tall winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana University.
>>srp_Latn<< Last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shaken" and "in shock" by Wade's death.
“It’s something we’re constantly worried about,” Wade said.
Volcanoes throwing ash at Mexico City
>>srp_Latn<< Ashes ejecting the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
>>bos_Latn<< The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from volcanoes due to increased activity in the crater and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
>>srp_Latn<< This center has recorded more mild seismological activities.
>>srp_Latn<< In pictures by social networks, thin layers of ash could be seen on the windshields of cars in Mexico City municipalities, such as Hochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in a volcano 72km southeast of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
>>srp_Latn<< Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence supporters clashed with riot police, while thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations on the first anniversary of the Catalan secession vote that divided the population.
A group of masked separatists, who were being restrained by riot police, threw eggs at them and threw powdered paint, and dark clouds of dust were created on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
>>srp_Latn<< Later in the day there was also a brawl that police officers restrained with batons.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “No forgetting, no forgiveness” in the face of Unionist protestors shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people received aid for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media reports.
Tensions are not waning in the independence region even a year after the October 1 referendum, which is celebrated by separatist Catalans, although Madrid has declared it illegal.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, though the turnout was small as a mass of anti-detachment people boycotted the election.
>>srp_Latn<< According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region, leading to violent clashes.
>>srp_Latn<< Independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of national police forces.
>>srp_Latn<< Demonstrations were held, but the route had to change.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who came with his wife to protest the separatists, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of the brightest moments.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we are in a hopeless situation," he said.
Despite achieving a key but narrow victory in the December regional elections, Catalan parties pushing for independence have struggled to continue in the same spirit this year as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and declaring independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest on the phone in support of police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he said.
Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since the end of last year, has announced he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"To highlight the candidacy for the European elections is the best way to condemn the collapse of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after car slamming into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after crashing into a house in Londonery.
>>srp_Latn<< This incident took place on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent Street at around 7:30pm British summer time.
>>bos_Latn<< Detective Inspector Bob Blemings stated that the entrance and the building itself were damaged.
It is also possible that at some point a crossbow was fired on the house.
>>srp_Latn<< Menge's scoring brings Livingstone victory over Rangers by 1-0
>>srp_Latn<< Dolly Menga secured the victory with the first goal for Livingston
>>srp_Latn<< Livingston surprised Rangers upon his move to the higher leagues by forcing Stephen Gerard to concede only his second loss in 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox Stadium.
>>srp_Latn<< Dolly Manga brought changes with his goal as Gary Holt's team tied with Hibernian in second place.
>>srp_Latn<< Gerard's team remains winless away in the Premier League this season, and next week meets leaders on the Harts table, who are eight points behind.
>>srp_Latn<< Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
>>srp_Latn<< Meanwhile, Livingston extended the streak without a loss in the division to six games, with head coach Holt not yet experiencing a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
>>bos_Latn<< Livingston missed chances against uninspired guests
>>srp_Latn<< Holt's team was to lead long before the scoring he scored, since he was making trouble for Rangers with offensive play at all levels.
>>srp_Latn<< Scott Robinson broke through, but carried the ball in front of the goal, for Alan Litgou to kick it past the net after slipping to take a headbutt by Craig Halket in front of the goal.
>>srp_Latn<< The hosts were happy to let the Rangers players play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties for the visiting team with playable actions.
That’s how they scored the key goal.
>>srp_Latn<< Rangers made the offense, and Livingston opened the game after taking a free kick by having Declan Gallagher and Robinson combine to employ Mengo who passed the ball into goal from mid-scholar.
>>srp_Latn<< In the previous part of the game, Rangers had dominated ball possession, but could not break through the host defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems,
>>srp_Latn<< The same style continued in the second half, although Kelly had to defend one shot by Alfred Morelos.
>>srp_Latn<< Alan McGregor, Rangers goaltender, deflected Scott Pittman's attack and Litgou kicked past goal in Livingston's second game action.
>>srp_Latn<< Livingston defended several centre-kicks, and two penalty kicks were also denied - after Halket's objection to replacing Glen Middleton and one for playing with his hand.
"The Phenomenal Game" by Livingston - analysis
>>srp_Latn<< Alasder Lamont from BBC Scotland Television at Toni Macaroni Stadium
>>bos_Latn<< A phenomenal performance and score for Livingston.
All players, without exception, were outstanding and again exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Since returning to the front lines, they have hardly changed the style of the game and people, but one should give great credit to Holt for the way he has brought vivacity to the team since his arrival.
There were so many heroes.
>>srp_Latn<< Captain Halket was unsurpassed in leading a top organized defense, while Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warall on standby the whole time.
>>bos_Latn<< However, Rangers were not inspired.
As good as he used to be under Gerard, he fell way below that level.
>>srp_Latn<< They couldn't score - they only broke through the host's defense once - and it's a sort of alarm bell for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne.
The meeting between the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29th) during breakfast in Berlin was accompanied by mixed reactions.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They differed on issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to most of the Turkish population outside of Turkey.
>>srp_Latn<< Police blocked a gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque citing security reasons, but many supporters found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him home.
The conflicting protests reflect a split in opinion about a visitor who is berated by some Turks in Germany as a hero, while others accuse her of being an autocrat.
Road accident in Depford: iclist killed in car crash
In a car crash in London, a cyclist was killed.
>>srp_Latn<< The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at around 10:15 a.m. British summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics gave him help, but the man died on the spot.
>>srp_Latn<< A few months before this collision, another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the collision that occurred on Saturday, which the driver hit and fled.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
>>srp_Latn<< The roads are closed and bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in rioting
>>srp_Latn<< Six prison officers were injured in the unrest in a men's prison with a high degree of security, according to the prison facility.
>>srp_Latn<< The riots still ongoing occurred at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. British summer time.
A team of Tornado specialists was brought in to deal with the unrest, which was reduced to one wing and involved eight prisoners.
Police officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison officials have been brought in for the ongoing incident at Her Majesty’s Long Lartin Prison.
>>srp_Latn<< Six staff members received assistance due to injuries.
>>srp_Latn<< We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear our position that responsible persons will be reported to the police, which is why they could stay behind bars longer."
>>bos_Latn<< In Her Majesty's prison Long Lartin has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the state.
>>srp_Latn<< In June, it was announced that the warden of the prison was undergoing hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
>>srp_Latn<< In October last year, riot police were called to prison for serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
The cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened by Hurricane Rosa with torrential flooding (which can come in handy in drought-affected areas).
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but it is likely to occur early next week as Hurricane Rosa moves across the desert in the southwest, carrying with it the risks of torrential flooding.
>>srp_Latn<< The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
>>srp_Latn<< Rosa is expected to reach Phoenix directly on Tuesday, and her approach will be heralded by rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status at 200 miles [320 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
>>bos_Latn<< Hurricane Katrina (1967) struck a region 64 km away from the Arizona border."
>>srp_Latn<< The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 5 to 10 cm, with amounts of up to 15 cm in isolated places, such as Mogolon Rim in Arizona.
>>srp_Latn<< In other areas of the desert in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin (Great Basin), it is likely to be 2.5 -5 cm, with possible totals in isolated places up to 10 cm.
For areas where there is no fear of torrential flooding, the rains Rosa will bring can be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious cause for concern, rain will be welcome in some parts as droughts are currently raging in the southwest.
>>srp_Latn<< According to the U.S. drought surveillance agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been affected by at least extreme drought, a second-class category," Weather.com reports.
>>srp_Latn<< Hurricane Rosa's trajectory first leads to landslides in Mexico's Lower California Peninsula.
Rosa, who still had hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 135 kilometers per hour, is currently 620 kilometers south of the village of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and heading north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
>>srp_Latn<< The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it lost power.
>>srp_Latn<< That is why landslides in Mexico are expected to occur when the storm reaches the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
>>srp_Latn<< In parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is possible which brings a significant risk of flooding.
“A total rainfall of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Lower California to the northwestern part of Sonora State, with possibly as much as 10 cm,” Weather.com reports.
>>srp_Latn<< Rosa will then move northward through Mexico as a tropical storm, to reach the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move upwards through Arizona and arrive in southern Utah late at night on Tuesday.
“The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rain in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the American desert in the southwest,” the National Hurricane Monitoring Center said in a statement.
This rain is expected to lead to torrential, life-threatening floods and the spreading of water in deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
>>srp_Latn<< After a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
>>srp_Latn<< The injured teenager was found on Excelsior Terrace Street in the town of Midsomer Norton, Saturday at around 04:00 British summer time.
He was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.
>>srp_Latn<< During the night, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the area of the city of Radstock, according to the Avon and Somerset Police Service.
Police have asked anyone who may have footage of this event on their mobile phones to contact her.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the spite and anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a speech in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the spite and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh, in an energetic and emotional testimony before Congress on Thursday, denied claims by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At this hearing, Ford also testified to her claims.
On Saturday, the president said that “the American people saw all the genius, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh.
>>srp_Latn<< A positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class biography in public service," he said before gathered supporters in West Virginia.
>>srp_Latn<< The president briefly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination during a speech on the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
>>srp_Latn<< Although I'm not running personally, I'm actually running," he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump concluded that the Democrats were on a mission to “provide resistance and distraction.”
>>srp_Latn<< The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, according to a statement by the senior assistant to the GOP leadership for CNN.
Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami have left hundreds dead, and the number continues to rise.
>>srp_Latn<< At least 384 people have died, with many being swept away by giant waves crashing into the beaches when the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a major earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on Friday for a beach festival when six-meter-high waves hit the shore, taking many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach, instead of running away immediately and therefore becoming victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a press release in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses and hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
>>srp_Latn<< Some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and thus survived, he said.
>>srp_Latn<< Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palu.
>>srp_Latn<< Air photos released by the disaster mitigation agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges distorted and demolished, and a mosque surrounded by water.
>>srp_Latn<< The accompanying quakes struck the coastal city again on Saturday.
2.4 million people were affected by the earthquake.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said Friday’s earthquake energy was about 200 times higher than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical characteristics of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, contributed to the development of a greater tsunami," he said.
Nugroho said the damage was “tremendous” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
>>srp_Latn<< The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
>>srp_Latn<< Nugroho stated that greater losses and damage along the coast are possible 300 km north of the city of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely cut off and there was no information" from Dongala, Nugroho noted.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” the statement said.
>>srp_Latn<< On Saturday, the agency received criticism from various sides that it had not issued a notification that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of the building is heard shouting from the heel, warning people on the street of the approaching tsunami.
>>bos_Latn<< Within minutes a wall of water hit the shore, taking buildings and cars away.
>>srp_Latn<< Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused communications to be cut off around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
Authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still needed food and other basic supplies.
>>srp_Latn<< The city's airport has only been reopened for assistance arriving and will remain closed until October.
>>srp_Latn<< President Yoko Vidodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
>>srp_Latn<< The balance of victims of the Indonesian tsunami impact exceeded 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
>>srp_Latn<< The staff of the World Vision humanitarian organization arrived safely from Dongala to the city of Palu where employees hide in shelters made of waterproof material placed in the office yard and on their way to the city were greeted with scenes of destruction and devastation, Mr Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is extremely bad.
>>srp_Latn<< Even as relief groups began to take the first steps in mitigating the disaster, there were complaints that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were not allowed to travel to Pale.
>>srp_Latn<< According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of overseas funds, supplies and people is only possible if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't come to that yet.
"It continues to be characterized as a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When state institutions declare a national disaster, we can provide international assistance, but so far there is no such status.”
When the second night fell on Pale after the earthquake and tsunami that hit it on Friday, friends and family of the missing still harbored the hope that their loved ones would miraculously escape the sad fate of the victims of natural disasters.
The little boy was pulled out of the sewers on Saturday.
>>srp_Latn<< On Sunday, rescuers released a woman from under the rubble who had been trapped next to her mother's body for two days.
>>srp_Latn<< Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
>>bos_Latn<< The others trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
>>srp_Latn<< Mr. Gendon recounted how, hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse reached the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
>>srp_Latn<< However, his messages carried only one grey mark, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
>>srp_Latn<< Thieves took in $26,750 during an ATM charge at the Newport on the Levee facility
The thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s employee who was filling an ATM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at an amusement complex and preparing to throw in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “ran behind the back of a Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money he was supposed to put in an ATM.
>>srp_Latn<< According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
All those with information about their identities are urged to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing this change on Saturday on Twitter, he wrote: “It will once be known as Kanye West.”
>>srp_Latn<< West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, so he used it to name his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He was invited to the show instead of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's author said.
>>srp_Latn<< Apart from representing the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that this word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible and means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with a radio host named Big Boy.
“I’m you, I’m all of us, that’s us.
From the name Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, I have passed to ‘Ye’ (you) alone, which is the personification of all the good, the bad, and the obscure in us.
>>srp_Latn<< This album is, essentially, a reflection of who we are."
He's just one of many famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs, who is known by the nicknames Puff Daddy, Pi Didi or Didi, said this year that he would like to be referred to as "Love" and "Brother Love".
>>srp_Latn<< Formerly West's associate, J.J.-Z., used the nickname with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians.
On Saturday, Lopes Obrador made a promise in Tlatelolk Square that he would "never use the military to carry out repression against the Mexican people".
>>srp_Latn<< On October 2, 1968, troops fired on peaceful protesters gathered in the square and killed as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were based in Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial aid each month to those studying and opening more free state universities.
He said unemployment and the inability to get an education were pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in AI development, the U.S. needs to double the amount it spends on research in this area, according to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
>>srp_Latn<< These comments came after various foreign governments of the United States announced the development of artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy for doing so.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“To begin with, it would be good to double the budget for AI research, since all other countries are so behind schedule for the U.S., and we are striving for new progress in this domain,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next major AI breakthrough happening in the United States, Li told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, works as CEO of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
>>srp_Latn<< In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later was the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's branch in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge of the U.S. Department of Defense Agency responsible for the development of new technologies (DARPA) and asked when the next one would take place, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state scholarships, Li said.
"It's not the academic leaders going to China, it's the big corporations," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed prominent minds from universities to work on the development of artificial intelligence.
>>srp_Latn<< Lee points out that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its aspirations in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be automatically offered to doctors in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council outlined a plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence.
China's National Foundation for Natural Sciences is funding people in academic institutions much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are giving money to U.S. researchers, with the quality of academic work being lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence that will include partners from the sector and academia, while the White House announced the formation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the “Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation” initiative.
>>srp_Latn<< On the other hand, the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the establishment of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been active for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", ending a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their EU and NATO membership bids.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the neighbouring northern state's name is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would jeopardise the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slovenian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the turnout would reach the minimum 50 percent it would take for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question on the ballot reads: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece.”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying in exchange for membership in alliances such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgievska, 79, said in Skopje.
>>srp_Latn<< While not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said they will comply with the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
>>bos_Latn<< The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been reported by 1pm.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters went to the polls.
"I went out to vote for my children, because we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev voted in a referendum in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia with his wife Zorica and son Dusko on changing the name of the country that should open the country's path to membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tent set up by opponents of the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the upright heads, not through the service entrance," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be ‘for’ because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after the vote.
He added that the result “for” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will vote in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
A second poll, conducted by Macedonian television Thelma, concluded that 57 per cent of voters would vote in the referendum.
Of these, 70 percent voted yes.
In order for the referendum to succeed, half of the registered voters must vote plus one.
Failure in the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes the entire defence of Brighton and scores a goal
>>srp_Latn<< Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defence on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England by taking a 2–0 victory for Manchester City.
>>srp_Latn<< This seemed too easy when Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
>>bos_Latn<< The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield from where he started the attack.
>>srp_Latn<< He ran between three Brighton defensive players, then mowed everyone in the open field.
Then Aguera was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
>>srp_Latn<< He outplayed one defense player, then overtook several others on the edge of a Brighton goal.
He then kicked the ball to the left, finding Sterling.
>>srp_Latn<< The English winger immediately returned the ball to Aguer, who overcame Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan by kicking into the right side of the net with his right boot.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what it was.
>>srp_Latn<< We were lucky to have scored a goal at that point."
>>srp_Latn<< However, the SkyBlues' initial advantage in the Premier League meeting was brought by Sterling.
>>bos_Latn<< He scored in the 29th minute.
>>srp_Latn<< Aguero took the ball deep in Brighton territory in that action.
He made a wonderful pass to Leroy Seine on his left flank.
>>srp_Latn<< Shane had several contacts with the ball before hiring Sterling on the second tripod.
>>srp_Latn<< The SkyBlues striker threw the ball into the net, then slid right out of the field limits.

>>srp_Latn<< Scherzer wants to play a game against Rocky with no competitive significance to the Nationals
>>srp_Latn<< Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoff competition, there were not many reasons to insist on another game.
>>srp_Latn<< However, the competitive Scherzer hopes to take the position on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have one game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers, are still in the playoffs game.
The Rockies secured a wild card victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to win their first division title.
“While we can’t get anything, at least we can get out on the court knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be at the highest level against any point I would play this year.
Why shouldn't I participate in such a contest?"
>>srp_Latn<< Nashnals has not yet announced a starter for the week, but they are reportedly considering letting Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
>>srp_Latn<< Scherzer, to whom this would be the 34th time he opens a game, held a practice session on Thursday and will pitch on Sunday when he normally rests.

Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
The president briefly addressed the situation of his Supreme Court nominee, Bret Kavanaugh, during a speech on the significance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
"Everything we have achieved will be put on the line in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
"These are some of the biggest ones - even though I'm not running personally, I'm actually running and that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continues: “Look at this terrible radical group of Democrats, look what’s happening now.
>>bos_Latn<< They are determined to regain power by not choosing the means, you see spite, dirty games.
>>srp_Latn<< They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “provide resistance and distraction.”
“You could have seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, spiteful, heinous and dishonest.”
>>srp_Latn<< He mentioned Democratic Senator and Justice Committee member Diane Feinstein by name, causing a loud public outcry.
“Do you remember her answer?”
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, what.
>>srp_Latn<< No, no, I'm waiting for him -- it was very bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
>>srp_Latn<< The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
There is no tolerance for those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for my censorship, it almost didn’t surprise me.
I am just the latest in a series of Labour MPs to be told they are not welcome - just because we expressed our opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan River, went through the same thing because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
>>srp_Latn<< In my case, the censorship initiative followed criticism for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe - the irony is that these are similar topics that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting at the Labour Party in East Nottingham on Friday said that “we want meetings to be comprehensive and productive.”
Of the eight years I've been a member of Parliament from the Labour Party, the meetings of the general committee on Friday nights have generally been just that.
Unfortunately, meetings are rarely held in this spirit today, and the promise of a “nobler, more moderate” policy has long been forgotten, if ever there were any such aspirations.
>>srp_Latn<< It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed according to whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared similar political views began expecting me to change them and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with - be it national security or the EU single market.
Every public address I make, regardless of what I say, is accompanied by a tirade of abuses on social media, calling for the annulment of my election, condemning the politics of the centre, saying that I have no place in the Labour Party.
I’m not the only one with that experience.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
>>bos_Latn<< I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis without ever being distracted by it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that various types of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The real truth is that we no longer accept different views and with each vote of no confidence or change in the rules of elections, the party becomes more and more stale.
Over the past two years, I have been frequently advised, asking me to lower my head, keep my opinion to myself, and then “be fit.”
But it's against my political agenda.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago from the school bench, caused by the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government who allowed my school classroom to literally collapse, I have strived to provide better public services to those who need it most - whether as a local councillor or a minister in government.
I never hid my political affiliations, not even in the last election.
>>srp_Latn<< No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political beliefs and topics on which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this initiative on Friday, I would only say that, at a time when our country is heading for a Brexit that will endanger households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
Yet my only message is not to the Nottingham Momentum organization, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rescinding my election or political ploy will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

>>srp_Latn<< Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
>>srp_Latn<< The two late essays may have somewhat distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ire won a well-deserved victory in this exciting game of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
>>srp_Latn<< They are now at the top of the table, being the only undefeated side out of a total of ten.
>>srp_Latn<< In the end, the home team took the upper hand thanks to superior defense, as well as a greater number of used chances and coach Peter Murchi had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested at the games so far and we haven’t yet experienced a defeat, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose team said: “All the praise for Ayr, they took their chances better than we did.”
>>srp_Latn<< Grant Anderson's 14th minute essay, turned by Frasier Climo, brought Ira an advantage, but a yellow card for Scotland captain, Rory Hugh, who had been taken out of the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Bagot grabbed the unconverted essay.
>>srp_Latn<< Climo increased Ire's lead with a penalty, before, at half-time, he scored and converted a solo essay to make Ire score 17-5 on the break.
>>srp_Latn<< However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Bagot, reduced the backlog to five points.
>>srp_Latn<< There was then a lengthy setback due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was brought out on a stretcher, and Ire further increased the lead with an essay by Stafford McDowell, who was converted by Climo.
>>srp_Latn<< Then Ira's deputy captain, Blair McPherson, was given a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the players more by Bruce Colvin failing to convert the essay, after a brief hard pressure.
>>srp_Latn<< However, the host side returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for wrestling Klima without a ball, from the penalty line, McPherson entered a touchdown behind the Ira pier in the attack.
>>srp_Latn<< Klimo converted the essay, which he did again almost immediately below, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth essay of the home side.
‘Still Game’ star set for new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan is preparing to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been appointed as the CEO of a company that holds licensed restaurants.
>>srp_Latn<< The 56-year-old plays the character Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, in which she is screenwriter and stars along with long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemfill.
>>srp_Latn<< The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last season of the show's broadcast and Kiernan seems to be making plans for life after Craiglang.
>>srp_Latn<< By official record he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source at the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow's "successful restaurant sector".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has been stripped of its access to the sea, hopes that the court will allow it back into the Pacific
>>srp_Latn<< Sailors patrol at the naval headquarters in La Paz.
>>srp_Latn<< The ocean-colored flag is flown at public facilities.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: “We have full right to the sea.
We have a duty to bring him back."
Bolivia, which has been stripped of access to the sea, still has memories of losing its shores in a bloody conflict over resources with Chile in the 19th century, and with it longing for another voyage across the Pacific Ocean.
>>srp_Latn<< These hopes may be the greatest in decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia's current development is in the hands, it is dominated by a spirit of unity and tranquility and, of course, expects the outcome in a positive spirit," said Roberto Calsadilya, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
For Eva Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of indigenous origin - who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year - Monday's ruling also carries a lot of risks.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor - and that little would change if it did.
The Dutch-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has said it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And not only has the case of Bolivia not progressed, but the previous four years may have set it back.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized upon by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has killed any affection for Chile, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
>>srp_Latn<< Former President Edwardo Rodrigues Velce, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagreed with the claim that the court had unusually quickly made a decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
He also denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the issue of the sea as a political foothold.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“This judgment is an opportunity to see the necessity of overcoming the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it doesn’t trust the US
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never lift their nuclear weapons program if they don’t have confidence in Washington.
>>srp_Latn<< Ri delivered a speech before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
>>srp_Latn<< He urged the United States to deliver on the promises made during the Singapore summit in talks between the conflicting leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be about to restart stalled diplomatic talks on nuclear weapons more than three months after meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says it’s only a dream that continuing sanctions and opposing the U.S. declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not ready to accept the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps in the disarmament process.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang’s renunciation of its nuclear arsenal, which its country likely sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
In Paris fashion shows are presented the latest lines of bulky headcovering accessories that you will soon see in the nearby main street
>>srp_Latn<< If you want to enrich your hat collection with bulkier models or block the sun completely, the search is over.
>>srp_Latn<< Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented on the runway a series of wacky huge head accessories from their Spring/Summer 2019 collection that overshadowed everything at Paris Fashion Week.
Incredibly impractical hats set fire to Instagram this summer, and these designers showcased their impressive creations on the catwalk.
>>srp_Latn<< Among Valentine's pieces, the over-emphasized beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like brim that swallowed the heads of the model with its size.
Other bulky accessories include jewelry-decorated watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks at the right time for Halloween.
>>srp_Latn<< Many colorful masks had sewn lips and were more suited to Hannibal Lecter than to high fashion.
>>srp_Latn<< One creation resembled a diving kit complete with a snorkel and a mask, while the other looked like melted ice cream in a cone.
And if you build on the trend of attracting attention to bulky fashion details - you're in luck.
>>srp_Latn<< Those following trends predict that huge hats could soon be worn on nearby main streets.
The bulky hats follow the appearance of the popular straw hat “La Bomba” with a six-foot-wide rim that has been walked by many celebrities - from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
>>srp_Latn<< The cult label on this impractical hat, which flooded social networks, stood behind another large creation featured on the runway - straw beach bags almost the same size as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
In the Jacquesmus collection La Riviera for spring/summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week, the most prominent was the bag made of burnt orange raffia, lined with raffia and with a white leather handle at the top.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect the big hats and beach bags to arrive on Main Street next summer, because the designer has made such a boom, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for bulky accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of language is crucial for global citizens
>>srp_Latn<< Independent schools in Scotland can boast outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new set of outstanding test scores, further strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
>>srp_Latn<< With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of services for students and parents.
>>srp_Latn<< Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and higher education, a chosen career, and a place in society as global citizens.
>>srp_Latn<< As an education sector that can devise and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject of choice for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it will get into their head.
>>bos_Latn<< If you talk in his native language, it will reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
>>srp_Latn<< Based on the recent results of this year's tests we see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest passing scores in independent schools.
>>srp_Latn<< A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
>>srp_Latn<< Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher A grade from Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63% of those learning Spanish also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland value foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
>>srp_Latn<< Languages are now, as a subject of choice, given the same importance as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
>>bos_Latn<< The 2014 UK Commission on Employment and Skills poll cited employers as the underlying problems when filling vacancies, 17 percent attributed to language ignorance.
That is why language skills are increasingly important in order to prepare young people for future careers.
Given the multiple potential business opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future because they possess a skill like this for life.
>>bos_Latn<< The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a person who speaks multiple languages above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent said they did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of respondents, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
>>srp_Latn<< Knowing multiple languages, especially those spoken in developing countries, will give children a greater chance of finding significant employment.
Each school in Scotland will be taught different languages.
>>srp_Latn<< Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom viewed in advance in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be more languages available in independent schools to choose from, with teaching staff who are proficient in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It cannot be denied that today, in the global business environment, languages are still crucial to the future of the country, so they must also have a place in education.
Modern languages, in fact, should be considered the “skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice, diversity and exceptional achievements.
>>srp_Latn<< Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
It’s nearing the end of the wait for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
>>srp_Latn<< Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But his exact minutes have yet to be determined.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to have limited minutes.
>>srp_Latn<< After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game Lakers preseason schedule.
“I don’t need preseason games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
>>srp_Latn<< Time to hold Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallies tonight as part of the election campaign in Willing, West Virginia.
>>srp_Latn<< This is the first of five planned Trump rallies for next week, with stays in friendly venues, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote delayed to confirm his nominee for a vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm election because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when it comes to voting in November.
What time will Trump hold a rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week's Supreme Court hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over allegations of sexual harassment, with an expected vote to confirm his admission to the Senate delayed by a week until the FBI completes the investigation.
>>srp_Latn<< However, this series of rallies is held primarily to help Republicans gain support in the face of the November election.
As part of President Trump’s campaign, the five rallies are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“The importance of Congressional control is so great for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of the crowded election campaign season,” a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing, could rally supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, along with the Pittsburgh media,” reports the West Virginia Metro News.
Trump's visit to West Virginia, the country where he won the 2016 election with more than 40 percent of points, will be his second on Saturday in a month.
>>srp_Latn<< Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come in to try to raise him in the polls,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows determination in fight to stay in game to meet singles matches on Sunday
>>srp_Latn<< After three one-sided sessions, the pair's Saturday afternoon tournament is perhaps just what the Ryder Cup needs.
Although momentum variability is a fictional sports concept, players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
So, whose side would you say the momentum is on now?
“They had a six-point lead and now four, so you can say momentum is on our side,” Jordan Spitt said as he left.
Europe, of course, is ahead of us with four points advantage and another twelve in the game.
Although Americans, according to Spit, get a little wind in the back and have a lot on their side, especially the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each has three points out of four.
>>bos_Latn<< The Spit was killer from the first to the last kick and gave everyone a homework assignment.
>>srp_Latn<< The cheers grew louder during his round, to eventually play a key final kick and get a fourth match with the same result when he and Thomas fell behind two after two.
>>srp_Latn<< His final kick with which they won the match with 15 holes was greeted with a similar scream, reflecting the faith that the American team was not falling out.
“Basically, we just have to do our best and take care of our own match,” Spitt said.
That’s all these players can do.
>>bos_Latn<< 18 holes to leave a stamp.
>>srp_Latn<< The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are no doubt the story of the Ryder Cup.
>>srp_Latn<< An unusual and at the same time charming European pair won all four matches and played without error.
"Mollywood" was the only couple that did not play a God-damaged game on Saturday afternoon, but they were also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the second half on Friday morning.
The game they’ve shown so far and the way they exchange energy with a noisy crowd solidified them as top favorites on Sunday, and there’s no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take a potential European sunset victory over Le Golf National.
>>bos_Latn<< Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the European celebration.
>>srp_Latn<< Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly overcame Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The gods and double gods in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they never even managed to spring.
On Sundays, though, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
>>srp_Latn<< The four-ball game and the doubles tournament are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the tips they give and which they don't give and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has a great lead before the final day, but this session of the doubles tournament also showed that the U.S. team has a desire for a fight that some have suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe lead by 10-6 ahead of final day in Ryder Cup
>>srp_Latn<< Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, having gained a 10-6 advantage over the United States after Saturday's matches in a four-ball game and in a doubles tournament.
The inspired pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led with two victories over the moody Tiger Woods, increasing the score so far on the grounds of the Le Golf National club to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, which struggled to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the imprecise American side in a four-ball morning game and won the series 3-1.
>>srp_Latn<< The U.S. put up more resistance in the doubles tournament, winning two matches, but could not reduce the backlog.
>>srp_Latn<< Jim Furick's side must score eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari were named "Mollywood" after a fantastic weekend, only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four matches.
>>srp_Latn<< After running over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then blended in great and overcame the pumped Woods and American debutant Bryson Deschamps with an even more convincing 5-4.
>>srp_Latn<< Woods, who had slipped through two matches on Saturday, shone for moments, but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in a four-ball game and in a pair tournament and seven in a row.
>>srp_Latn<< Justin Rose, who had rested during the four-ball morning game, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the pair's tournament and suffered a 2–1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka - first and third in the world rankings.
But not everything went according to plan on this pleasant, clear day southwest of Paris.
>>srp_Latn<< Three-time Majors tournament winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
>>srp_Latn<< They won a 2-1 victory over John Ram and Jan Pulter in a four-ball game, to come back later and beat Pulter and Rory McElroy 4-3 in the doubles tournament, after losing the first two holes.
>>srp_Latn<< Only twice in Ryder Cup history has some team returned after a four-point behind before single matches, although Furick's side, which defends the title, is enough of a draw to keep the trophy.
>>srp_Latn<< However, after already being in second place for two days, it appears that Sunday's counterattack would be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says 'no talk' of unilateral disarmament if no confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extending sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances, the country would by no means unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant measures over the past year to demonstrate goodwill,” such as cutting off nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and promising not to replicate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But there is no appropriate reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no question that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri repeated North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization that would have rewarded North Korea for its gradual steps, his statement was of significance because he did not put unilateral denuclearization out of play as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current U.S. president and North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work to “denuclearize the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also ignored calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States does not give up on 'denuclearization in the first place' and increases the level of pressure from sanctions to achieve their goal by force, even opposing the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The fact that they think sanctions can bring us to our knees is just the dreams of people who don’t know anything about us.
>>srp_Latn<< But the problem is that prolonging sanctions deepens our distrust."
>>srp_Latn<< Ri made no mention of plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader spoke about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If we were negotiating this problem of denuclearization with South Korea, not with the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come to such a deadlock."
Despite this, the tone of Rio’s speech differed drastically from last year’s, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that striking the U.S. mainland with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
>>srp_Latn<< Trump said on Wednesday that he had not set a time frame for this, saying, "If it's to last two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Security Council sanctions must continue to be strictly and without relenting until there is complete, definitive, confirmed denuclearization.”
The U.N. Security Council has unanimously backed sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio outside the U.N. General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made and that North Korea would condemn him after just hours for making "gangster demands".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile range as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim told him they were “appropriate measures” seeking security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on How to Get Enough Sleep
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to force students to get more sleep in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho culture of learning “all night long with the help of caffeine.”
>>srp_Latn<< One academic observed that university students are the number one in the world often ignorant about basic self-care.
Charles Chysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has devised a course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
>>srp_Latn<< He got the idea of this course after a speech he held about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing this now, in my last year of study?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
In this course, which is held for the first time this year, students are presented with the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports results, as well as improving their overall well-being.
>>srp_Latn<< Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at this university, says the university has decided to introduce this course after it was observed that students suffer from serious sleep deprivation during the week.
>>srp_Latn<< The one-hour course covers a range of interactive tasks.
>>srp_Latn<< In one section is a picture of a dorm room and students need to click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of sleep routines.
In the second part, participants listen to how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
>>srp_Latn<< Then the campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
“But we believe they have a right to know that, just as everyone has a right to know the consequences of smoking cigarettes for their health.”
A culture of pride about “not sleeping all night” continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students has led to sleep deprivation becoming a growing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and of good quality, should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even against excess weight, since due to lack of sleep, the brain goes into starvation mode, and therefore they are constantly hungry.
>>srp_Latn<< Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Chyzler devise the course, after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
>>srp_Latn<< He says this course opened his eyes and encouraged him to advocate for its maintenance at the campus level.
>>srp_Latn<< The next step, as he hopes, would be to ask all postgraduates to undergo a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chyzler recommended that students consider setting alarms in time for sleep and waking, and that they take into account the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus lead to sleep problems.
>>srp_Latn<< Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeats Gerard's team with goal
>>srp_Latn<< Rangers suffered another downturn in the away game when Dolly Menga sent a shot-out displaced Stephen Gerard's team into a 1–0 loss to Livingston.
>>srp_Latn<< The Ibrox Stadium team sought to take their first away win after a February 4–1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerard as manager only a second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unattainable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premier League, Harts.
>>srp_Latn<< Menga kicked seven minutes before half-time, and the uninspired Rangers lineup never came close to a tie.
>>srp_Latn<< As Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third behind Hibernian only because of the goal difference.
>>srp_Latn<< Rangers can face additional problems after line judge Calum Spence had to be shown help due to a head wound after being hit on the side by some object.
>>srp_Latn<< Gerard made eight changes to the team that outscored Ire and placed in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
>>srp_Latn<< Holt, on the other hand, opted for the same eleven Livingston players who took the Harts' point last week and would have been delighted with the way his well-trained team was pressuring opponents at every turn.
>>srp_Latn<< Rangers may have dominated the property, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
>>srp_Latn<< He was a little short of scoring just two minutes after Meng's first pass into the empty space sent Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed a great chance and kicked past the goal.
>>srp_Latn<< Kegan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halket with a deep free kick, but his defensive partner Alan Litgou kicked past goal at the second putt.
>>srp_Latn<< Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last line gave off more hope than faith in themselves.
>>srp_Latn<< Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Loules collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
>>srp_Latn<< Rangers made only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox Stadium goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, defended the blow with the head of Lasana Koulibali without major problems and tamed the shot put by Ovie Ejaria.
>>srp_Latn<< Although Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the real power-to-power ratio during the game, no one can dispute that he was deserved if for nothing else, then for the effort he put in.
>>srp_Latn<< Rangers again could not cope with the Jacobs' deep-seated action.
>>srp_Latn<< Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pulled the ball through to Slot Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
>>srp_Latn<< Gerard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibali and that replacement almost immediately gave the result when the winger employed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block him.
>>srp_Latn<< However, Livingston continued to get guests to play just as they pleased, with long balls by Litgou and Halket.
>>srp_Latn<< Holt's team had a chance to increase the advantage in the final minutes, but McGregor held up well and defended the Jacobs offense, then sent the ball past the goal from the corner.
>>srp_Latn<< Glen Middleton, a Rangers substitute, was looking for another penalty at the end of the game when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson did not react again.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
>>srp_Latn<< Geiger devised a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the mainstays of science, Geiger’s Counter also has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Coronado Bell, starring seemingly incredible cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What’s that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on those headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “Look, it’s really there!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize damaged cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize and kill depraved cells
>>bos_Latn<< The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then “see” a protein that is common in many cancers and then re-inject them.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells, ovarian cancer has retreated for more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” the protein that occurs in many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells has been well demonstrated in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined the fierce attacks in defense of Trump, wearing an MAGA cap, after a guest appearance on SNL.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unrelated speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for political office in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost Town", that night with a hat with the slogan "Make America Great", he gave a fierce speech against the Democrats and again offered support to Trump.
“I’ve talked so many times to white people who would say to me, ‘How can you support Trump when he’s racist?’
“If I were worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
>>srp_Latn<< The SNL broadcast a sketch featuring Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star made fun of Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blaise Ford's claims of sexual abuse.
>>srp_Latn<< Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted footage of West's heated speech on social media.
>>srp_Latn<< It is unclear if Rock wanted to make fun of West with this announcement.
>>srp_Latn<< Additionally, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of the cap he was wearing.
“They threatened me behind the scenes.
They told me, “Don’t go out with that hat.”
They threatened me!
>>srp_Latn<< And then they say I sank," he said, reports the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see what it looks like?” adding that he would “put on Superman’s cape because it means you can’t boss me around. You want a better world?
Then spread love."
The audience booed his remarks at least twice and appeared to be uncomfortable with the cast of SNL, Variety reported, while one of the attendees told the magazine: “The whole studio was sick.”
At the last minute, West replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller, passed away a few days ago.
News confused many with his performance of "I Love It", disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
The news was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUS group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR NOT TRYING TO BE IN FRONT OF THE BLAMERS.”
However, TV presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply “own and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But my choice is NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and loudly praises an ideology that is bad for my community.
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "once known as Kanye West".
>>srp_Latn<< He is not the first performer to change his name - before him, it was done by Didi, also known as Puff Deddie, Puffie and Pi Didi.
>>srp_Latn<< Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Leone and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to a performer formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after man stabbed in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
>>srp_Latn<< The incident occurred on Ballyhackamore Street, according to police.
>>srp_Latn<< The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The attorney general will consider the charges.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington has condemned the deadly macho culture.
Keith Harrington is known for his role as John Snow in HBO's Game of Thrones, a medieval fantasy full of violence.
>>srp_Latn<< However, the 31-year-old actor denounced the macho hero stereotype, saying that such on-screen roles often make young men feel like they have to be rude to gain respect.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that “something went wrong” and addressed the question of how to deal with the problem of the disastrous macho culture of the YaIo era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he had a “strong need” to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m rather troubled by the question right now: What did we do wrong with representing masculinity?” he said.
“What are we teaching men growing up about the problem we see now?”
>>srp_Latn<< Keith believes that television may have been partly responsible for the spread of the disastrous macho culture due to the portrayal of characters posing as male.
He said, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is it they teach us on TV and on the streets that makes young men feel they have to fit into a certain mold of male behavior?
I think that’s actually one of the main issues of our time, how do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong with the young man."
He also admitted in an interview that he would not agree to prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones after the end of next summer, saying he had "done with the battlefields and the horses".
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's play True West - a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thug.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his current wife Rose is the best thing he has ever seen on Game of Thrones.
“In this series, I met my current wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on,” he said.
>>srp_Latn<< Rose played Igrit, the love partner of Keith's character John Snow, in this fantasy series that carries Emmy accolades.
>>srp_Latn<< The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase
>>srp_Latn<< China has announced a jump in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS of 14%.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In the vast majority of new cases, the virus was transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
>>srp_Latn<< HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past as a result of virus-infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
>>srp_Latn<< However, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
Transmitting HIV through sex is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
>>srp_Latn<< Homosexuality has not been considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say that discrimination against LGBT people is very widespread.
>>srp_Latn<< Studies estimate that, due to conservative understandings in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Transmission of the virus often occurs due to inappropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
>>srp_Latn<< In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff had leaked data on GOP senators, denouncing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that any of her staff had leaked personal information to three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia.
A Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and the “ultra-right wing” websites.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
>>srp_Latn<< The published information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, of Utah.
>>srp_Latn<< The information appeared online on Thursday, and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate Commission hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
>>srp_Latn<< The disclosure occurred at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
>>srp_Latn<< Conservative locations such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the announcements was linked to Waters's office and released information about a member of her staff, Hill reported.
“This baseless claim is a completely false and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and inaccurate claims - is in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
>>srp_Latn<< This baseless assertion is completely untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked online condemnation, which was also made by former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial exudes anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He can't be presumptuous.
He mustn't question the plaintiff's motives.
>>srp_Latn<< He must be calm and serene."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of acting too furiously at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who ran to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
“Big deal if it’s true,” his tweet read.
Waters said her office had informed "the relevant competent institutions and judicial authorities of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are held accountable before the law for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Review of "Johnny English: Back in Action" - a lukewarm satirical spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for a subtext on Brexit in every new British-themed film, which can also be applied to this sequel to Johnny English's satirical action comedy franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with the sequel Johnny English: Born Again.
>>bos_Latn<< Will the ironic autosatire about what kind of obvious garbage we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the grumpy, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber-like face has been given a new opportunity to mess something up - with his name revealing more than anything that it is a general comic creation designed for territories whose cinema audience English is not their native language.
It is, of course, a cunning secret agent who, despite bizarre claims to the highest glamour, carries a little bit of Clouseau, a little bit of Mister Bean and a little bit of that guy who played only one note in the theme tune of “Chariots of Fire” at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
>>srp_Latn<< It was also originally based on a traveler and mystery man in international frameworks that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
>>srp_Latn<< In this latest sequel about Johnny English, there are also several scenes worth mentioning.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly rattled about his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is quite lukewarm and unusually superficial, especially considering that “serious” film brands, such as 007 and Impossible Mission, now regularly include comic elements.
Humor feels like it's meant for kids, not adults and, to me, Johnny English's freaky misadventures aren't as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's silent movie gags when he was playing Bean.
It is now a very topical issue that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the dismay of an agent on duty - unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and combative character, who is already experiencing a complete meltdown due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thomson played this character masterfully, modeled after Theresa May, but the script is quite poor.
Intelligence consultants inform her that all active spies have been compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
It’s Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a fancy institution, but unofficially gives lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gags when English provides an academy for spying in the spirit of “School of Rock.”
>>srp_Latn<< Inglish returns to Whitehall on urgent procedure for instruction and reunites with former patient, Assistant Bau, who is re-interpreted by Ben Miller.
>>srp_Latn<< Bow is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, in an interpretation of Vicky Pepperdine which is somewhat redundant.
And so the clumsy and incompetent Batman and Robin are back in action in Her Majesty's Secret Service and meet the beautiful femme fatale Olga Kurilenko, Ophelia Buletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Waltha, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bau begin their odyssey of comical adventures: disguised as waiters, set fire to a flamboyant French restaurant, wreak havoc on Walt's luxury yacht, and English launches a real anarchy by trying to familiarize himself with the inside of Walt's house using headphones for virtual reality.
It’s obvious that a lot of effort was put into that last sequence, but no matter how cute and cheerful, the whole movie seemed to be made for children.
Pretty mediocre quality.
As with other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with a role for Rowan Atkinson that would justify his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is making a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is due to consider a radical plan to get the British to work four days a week - and get paid for five.
>>srp_Latn<< The party reportedly wants the heads of companies to transfer to workers the time they save thanks to the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
>>srp_Latn<< Employees would thus enjoy a three-day weekend - but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "fit" into the party's economic agenda and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
>>srp_Latn<< The move to a four-day work week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “It is expected that a review of the regulations will be announced by the end of the year.
“Change will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as in general the party’s industrial strategy.”
>>srp_Latn<< The Labour Party was not the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this trend is not currently shared by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not part of the party’s agenda and the party is not considering it.”
>>srp_Latn<< Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to outline his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell stressed his determination to regain power from “faceless directors” and “profits” in public companies.
The shadow minister's plans also imply that current shareholders in water-supply companies may not receive their full share because the Labour government could resort to "mining" on suspicions of unfair treatment.
>>srp_Latn<< He also confirmed plans to bring workers to the company's board of directors and create Inclusive Equity Funds, through which 10% of private firms' capital would be handed over into the ownership of employees who would receive an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak in 60 Minutes to see if they can change their minds about the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case.
>>srp_Latn<< The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week's final vote for his appointment as a member of the Supreme Court and raised the question whether the results of the bureau's investigation could influence the withdrawal of support from some of the Republican senators.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that might change their minds.
>>srp_Latn<< Kennedy was more outspoken than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, certainly,” Kennedy said.
“I said, going to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
>>srp_Latn<< I called him after it happened, when the charge came up and he said, 'Did you do it?'
>>srp_Latn<< He was determined, resolved, unequivocal."
>>srp_Latn<< However, Graham's voice appears to be carved in stone.
"I have made my decision on Brett Cavanaugh and not even the most explosive accusation would change it," he said.
"I don't know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I do know this: Brett has firmly rejected everything," Graham added, referring to Christine Blaze Ford.
“And no one she mentioned can confirm that.
That's 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will happen.”
What is the “Global Citizen” festival and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
>>srp_Latn<< This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a long and impressive roster of performers and no less impressive mission of eradicating poverty worldwide.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people not only to enjoy performances by performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to draw attention to the true goal of the event, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first held in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Eradication Project, an international group that advocates poverty eradication by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to do a number of tasks, namely “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to some of the world’s leaders, making a phone call or any other meaningful way of drawing attention to their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been, given the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” where people feel they’ve done something meaningful by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Organizers of the Global Citizen claim that since 2011 they have recorded more than 19 million actions by their supporters aimed at achieving a number of different goals.
They claim the actions helped encourage world leaders to announce goals and programs worth over $37 billion that would impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
>>srp_Latn<< In early 2018, the group listed 390 set goals and announcements stemming from its actions, for which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have directly affected over 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key programmes include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and contractors concluded in the UK to “help children grow to their full potential”, which have pledged to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn social injustice in the form of malnutrition into an item in history textbooks,” said Tracy Ullman, ambassador for the Food Power movement, during an April 2018 concert in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the United Kingdom to improve the feeding of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Food Power project, which will allow interventions to improve nutrition for up to 5 million women and children.
To one of the frequently asked questions on their website, which is “why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The global citizen responds: “It will be a long and difficult road - there will be failures and failures on it.
But just as great human rights were won before us and the anti-apartheid movements succeeded, so will we, because we are stronger together.
>>srp_Latn<< Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardy Bee and Janelle Monet are some of the performers performing at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy to block Russian energy exports, interior minister says
Washington can rely on its navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from reaching the destination markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinky said.
Zinky said Russia's involvement in Syria - where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a mask for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to sell their energy sources, just as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to this official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has the ability, with the help of our Navy, to ensure the openness of maritime routes, and if necessary to block them, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinky addressed the event organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group calling itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
>>srp_Latn<< He further compared Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran, claiming that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the exploitation and replacement of energy," he said, telling Russia that "a pony that knows only one trick" and a country with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements were made at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, which is a far cheaper option for European consumers.
To achieve this goal, officials in the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2, a $11 billion pipeline that is meant to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply fueled by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
>>srp_Latn<< The U.S. position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to this project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I am very bothered by the interference of third countries in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kemf, president of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “think hard” about running for the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “think hard” about running for president after midterm elections.
>>srp_Latn<< At a meeting with the city administration in Holjok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and take care of our dysfunctional government, and that includes the woman at the top," she said, according to the Hill newspaper.
“After November 6th, I will think hard about running for president.”
During her meeting with the city administration, Warren criticized President Donald Trump, saying she "leads the country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren wrote, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
>>srp_Latn<< However, a poll released on Thursday showed that even in its own electoral district, a majority of voters do not feel Warren should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the University Policy Research Center in Suffolk and the Boston Globe.
>>srp_Latn<< Thirty-two percent supported such a bid.
>>srp_Latn<< The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% supporting the presidential candidacy and 48% voting against.
>>srp_Latn<< Other sound names from the line of Democrats mentioned in connection with a possible 2020 bid include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump rally
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military in September.
>>srp_Latn<< On Monday night, he was detained and charged with an incident with domestic violence
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after he comes back, I can understand other families feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told an audience at a support rally for Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
She described his arrest as an example of a major problem that everyone ignores and said of her son and other war veterans: “They come back a little different, they come back tainted, they come back wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and all other members of the military have given this country.”
He was detained in Vassila, Alaska on Monday and charged with domestic violence in which a woman was assaulted, obstructing domestic violence and handling of weapons in an alcoholic state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vassila police station.
18 states and the District of Columbia support review of new asylum law
>>srp_Latn<< Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported a legal review of the new U.S. regulation that provides for refusing to provide asylum to victims fleeing family violence or gangs.
Representatives of 18 states and the Colombian district filed in Washington on Friday through “friends of the court” as an expression of support for an asylum seeker seeking to challenge the regulation, NBC News reported.
>>srp_Latn<< The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. Sessions initiated against federal regulation by the American Civil Liberties Union has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his sons, gang members” had abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on June 20.
She's been detained in Texas.
>>srp_Latn<< State lawyers providing legal support to Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, the countries from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Claims Committee that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
>>srp_Latn<< Columbia County Attorney General Carl Racine said on Friday that the new regulation "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
“The federal law requires that all decisions on all asylum applications be made on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances stated in the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the court’s “friends” statement said.
Lawyers further noted in the document that the regulation denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“The asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political stance,” Sessions said in a June 11 announcement.
The purpose of asylum has never been to solve all the problems - or even all the serious ones - that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts continue in Palu, with the death toll doubling as the race to find survivors continues.
The survivors were faced with an increasingly dire situation.
“It’s very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her son who is crying feverishly at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Emergency cars bring in bodies every minute.
There’s not enough clean water.”
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, scouring the sunken stuff and trying to save everything they can find.
>>srp_Latn<< Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
>>srp_Latn<< Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a spinal and shoulder fracture, lay outside a military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors for strong earthquakes that continued.
With tears in his eyes, he recounts how he felt as the earthquake violently shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I think you’re putting pressure on the ruins of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city for a wedding celebration.
“I heard my wife crying, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my child.
I hope they're all right."
US ambassador accuses China of “abuse of propaganda ads”
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US daily, highlighting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned the paid addition of China Daily to the Dimoyn Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional election, which China rejected.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new phase in Washington's campaign to exert increasing pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war as they introduce new rounds of tariffs on each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters from countries like Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party, U.S. and Chinese experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
As Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the Dimoyn Register, China “is now further harassing us by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s precious tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, publishing paid advertisements on the Dimoyn Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, at the newsstand in Beijing, you will find few conflicting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the conflicting opinions that the Chinese may have on the worrying trajectory of the Chinese economy, since the media is firmly in the grip of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers turned down an offer to publish” his article, but did not specify which list it was.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating female voters ahead of midterm elections because of a debacle with Judge Kavanaugh
While many at the top of the Republican Party support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual harassment, analysts warn that this will produce a negative reaction, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this situation are extremely strong, and most Republicans are already known to want to give him their vote.
>>srp_Latn<< Such things are impossible to retract," noted Grant Reicher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell College at the University of Syracuse in an article published in the Hill newspaper on Saturday.
>>srp_Latn<< Reicher expressed doubt that the insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) on the FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to appease the indignant voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
Protesters chanted “November is coming!” on Friday morning as they protested in the Senate hallway after Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to support Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach unprecedented proportions,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political activist.
"People say it's already on a high level, that's true.
>>srp_Latn<< But it can continue to grow, especially among indecisive female voters from the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29, who often don't vote, despite not liking the president."
Even before public testimony detailing allegations of sexual harassment by a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there could be a negative reaction if Republicans confirmed his candidacy.
“This has turned into a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News last week.
“It’s not just about the board vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will end up in court, it’s also about the way the Republicans have handled it here and the way they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of the Democratic-representative Pryoritis USA, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who they trust after the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, with a little more of those standing by the last one.
A new survey conducted by JuGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh was likely or definitively lying in his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
>>srp_Latn<< At the insistence of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her in an alcoholic state when she was 17.
>>srp_Latn<< Ramirez claims that a candidate for a member of the Supreme Court showed her his genitals during a party they attended during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Launch a New Internet to Oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup project that aims to become a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
>>srp_Latn<< The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, represents a company built on Berners-Left's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be able to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company magazine, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he told Startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their “personal space for online data storage,” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal space for online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, process and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
>>srp_Latn<< The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several permanent developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change that will turn all their business models upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
In an announcement Saturday on the Medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "has a mission to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network."
>>srp_Latn<< In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
>>srp_Latn<< In recent months, Berners-Lee has been one of the influential voices in the Internet neutrality debate.
>>srp_Latn<< Although it launches Inrupt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about this new era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Honoring the priest of World War I, the bearer of the Victoria Cross
The only priest of the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I is honored in his hometown after 100 years.
>>srp_Latn<< Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Van earned this decoration on 29 September 1918 when attacking at Belangliz and Leokur.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he received the highest British military medal.
>>srp_Latn<< His two grandchildren on Saturday unveiled the memorial plaque during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” that the record was discovered exactly 100 years after the feat his grandfather had earned the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Channel de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog, under heavy artillery and machine gun fire."
He then stormed the line of fire and led the attack with “greatest heroism” before attacking the artillery weapons on his own and throwing three crew members out of the machine.
>>srp_Latn<< Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but something that arouses a lot of respect."
>>srp_Latn<< He and his brother Dr James Van also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said he "feels very honored to have participated in the parade" and added "that the hero's prowess is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people will give him."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead got Pepu Pigs
Imagine if you stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and you were unable to watch the main event.
>>srp_Latn<< The San Jose event included 13 fights, including six in the main section and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
>>srp_Latn<< At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Musasi and Rory Macdonald were about to face each other, viewers in the UK were left bewildered when the transmission switched to Pepu Pigs.
Some were disappointed after staying up until the early morning because of this particular fight.
One fan described the switch to a children’s cartoon on Twitter as “some kind of sick joke.”
"According to state regulations, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator in charge of marketing and communication, responding to a question about the transmission.
"Pepa Piggy, yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Cocker said he would work on his programming scheme to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think as far as the replay goes, I think we're probably going to be able to handle it," Cocker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to fix it until Sunday at our time, Monday at their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission stopped, there were a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, the problem was up to the state.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We'll stick to five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- we've tried to give fans more than usual, and we've just gone too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly Felt ‘Inferior’ About Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old says he didn’t realize until his senior year of elementary school that “not everyone is like him.”
Speaking on Radio 4 in the first edition of Desert Island Discs to host Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said he has been less concerned about winning the Olympics since he became a parent.
>>srp_Latn<< The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Giving the impression of a rejected person in Laverno’s first broadcast, Daley said he felt “less valuable” than others as he grew up because “it wasn’t socially acceptable for you to like boys and girls.”
He said: “To this day, this feeling of being less valuable and being different, these were real things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone and something,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
>>srp_Latn<< The two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a prominent LGBT rights fighter and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly, without consequences, and because he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion says he was “surprised” by falling in love with a man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar-winning actor 20 years older than him last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such an early age" -- he went to the first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he says it was hard to find someone of the same age who had similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June, had a son, Robert Ray Black-Daily, and the Daily said his "read perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been just ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
>>srp_Latn<< Robbie is my gold Olympic medal."
>>srp_Latn<< His son bears the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was revealed to have brain cancer.
Daley says his father didn’t accept that he was going to die and that one of his last questions was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t live to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and he died that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
>>srp_Latn<< The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew this was what I’d dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
That feeling was also inspired by his selection of the first song “Prud” by Heather Small, who resonated with him in preparation for the Olympics and which still gives him chills.
>>srp_Latn<< Desert Island's show is dissembled on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m. British summer time.
Mickelson out of shape for Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match at the Ryder Cup, but will have to re-enter into shape to avoid remembering the occasion.
>>srp_Latn<< Mickelson, who participates in this two-year event for a record 12th time, was sent to the bench for Saturday's four-ball games and alternating-kick games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has been so often in the United States, the five-time champion will spend time partly as a fan and partly working on his game on the court in the hope of correcting what is bothering him.
Since he wasn’t the most accurate at his career’s peak, the 48-year-old is not an ideal candidate for the narrow course Le Golf nasional, where long stretches of high grass punish mistakes.
And if the pitch itself is not discouraging enough, Mickelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, teaming up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start 12 individual matches, have a tough start, Mikkelson’s match could absolutely be decisive.
Furik pointed out that he had confidence in his man, although he could not say anything much different.
“He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past, including this week.
I probably didn't plan for him to play two matches.
>>bos_Latn<< I planned more, but that's how it turned out and that's the way we decided we should go.
>>srp_Latn<< He wanted to be there as much as anyone else."
>>srp_Latn<< Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most weekly matches played in the Ryder Cup.
>>bos_Latn<< It could be the end of one career in the Ryder Cup that never actually reached the heights of his personal record.
>>srp_Latn<< Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furick says his absence was felt in the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to joke with people and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed the opportunity to tease him this week, which was fun to watch.
>>bos_Latn<< He provides much more than just the game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage may soon disappear
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a significant advantage on the eve of the final day of individual matches at the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
>>srp_Latn<< The Dane made his debut in 1997 in a match at Valderama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans but eventually pulled out by a hair, winning by a score of 141–132-131–132.
“I keep reminding myself that we had a big advantage at Valderama; we had a big advantage at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderama, where we won, it was barely,” says Bjorn (pictured) after watching a 5-3 win in the 2018 class on Friday and yesterday for a 10-6 lead at the Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not the end.
We're going full steam tomorrow.
Let's go out there and do everything right.
Nothing is finished until you have points on the table.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy and that will remain the focus.
I keep saying that, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but also how we are aware of who is standing on the opposite side - the best players in the world."
Delighted by the play of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run in front of the ore for that matter.
Tomorrow is something completely different.
Tomorrow the individual effect comes to light, and this requires a different game.
It’s nice to be there with your partner when things are going well, but when you’re there alone, then your full golfing capacity is on the test.
It's a message you have to give to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he also has to go out and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, rival team captain Jim Furick will ask his players for a better individual performance than the ones they have achieved with their partners, except for Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points.
Furik himself was on both sides of those big turnarounds on the last day, first as part of the winning team at Brooklyn, and then as a loser when the European team performed “Miracle in Medina.”
“I remember literally every word,” he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, raised the morale of his players as they prepared for their final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to have a quick start like the one you saw at Brooklyn and the one you saw at Medina.
>>bos_Latn<< When that rapture moves in one direction, a great deal of pressure is exerted on the central matches.
So we're making our own lineup and we're doing the guys the way we think we should, you know, we're trying to do some magic tomorrow."
>>srp_Latn<< Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and facing Rory Macilroy in the final match, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I started with this group of guys in that order because I think that’s how we cover all the way to the end,” Bjorn commented on his selection for individual matches.
Postponement for a new German warship
The German Navy’s latest frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era old warships, but will not arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and mounting costs, local media said.
>>srp_Latn<< The launch of the Rhineland-Falco, the flagship of the new class of the Baden-Wirthemberg frigate, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the Zeit newspaper which quoted the military spokesman as saying.
>>srp_Latn<< The vessel was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery spoiled the future of this ambitious project.
>>srp_Latn<< The four Baden-Wirtemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
>>srp_Latn<< It is known to possess a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as certain stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Other important features include longer maintenance-free periods - it should be possible for the latest frigate to spend up to two years sailing outside its home port.
However, the ongoing delay means that these state-of-the-art warships, which were supposed to enable Germany to project its power at sea, will already be obsolete when they enter service.
The ill-fated frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to receive the vessel and returned it to the Blom and Foss shipyards in Hamburg.
>>srp_Latn<< It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited several crucial “software and hardware defects” that would render this warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important, as the Baden-Wirtemberg class vessels would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the men on the older Bremen-class frigates.
>>srp_Latn<< Also, the ship's weight turned out to be drastically exceeded, which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to upgrade it later.
The Rhineland-Faltz is thought to weigh 7,000 tons more than the ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
>>srp_Latn<< In addition to the phallic hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - has also begun to pose a problem.
They say it has reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems with the latest frigate are particularly acute in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, confirmed that the Navy was in fact “out of ships capable of service”.
The official pointed out that the problem with time is becoming more serious and serious, since the ships were expended without the introduction of replacement vessels.
>>srp_Latn<< He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Wirthemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
National Fund eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
>>srp_Latn<< A new survey being conducted on a property in Scotland's Highlands aims to discover how bats use the geographical features of the terrain in search of food.
Researchers hope the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future activities to preserve them.
>>srp_Latn<< A survey of scientists from the National Fund for Scotland will follow the common and dwarf blind muscles, as well as brown long-eared lilies and water evenings in the Invere Garden in the Wester Ross area.
>>srp_Latn<< Special recording devices will be placed in key locations throughout the property in order to monitor bat activity during the season.
>>srp_Latn<< The staff and volunteers of the National Health Service of Scotland (NHS) will also conduct mobile tests with handheld detectors.
>>srp_Latn<< Expert sound analysis from all recordings will determine the frequencies of bat voices and what kind works.
>>srp_Latn<< A detailed habitat map will then be prepared alongside the report to get a picture of their behavior in relation to the terrain.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at the Fund, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
>>srp_Latn<< This information will contribute to determining the benefits of habitat editing such as meadow creation, as well as how best to manage forests for the benefit of bats and other related species.
>>srp_Latn<< The number of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly in the past century.
>>srp_Latn<< They are threatened by construction and development work affecting nesting and habitat loss.
>>srp_Latn<< Wind generators and lighting also pose a risk, as do adhesive strips for flies and some types of chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by house cats.
Blind mice aren't actually blind.
>>srp_Latn<< However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They rely on sophisticated echo-location techniques to determine the exact location of insects and obstacles on the path they are flying.
>>srp_Latn<< The NTS Fund which is in charge of caring for over 270 buildings of historical importance, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
>>srp_Latn<< The fund has ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, nesting checks, and sometimes rescue actions.
>>srp_Latn<< These organizations even established the first and only purpose-built bat reserve in Scotland, on the Trive estate in the areas of Damphries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
>>srp_Latn<< Estate manager David Thompson says this property is ideal territory for them.
“Here in Trivo we have a great space for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good habitat as a whole.
>>srp_Latn<< But much about bats is still unknown, so working here and on other estates will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
>>srp_Latn<< He stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before performing maintenance work as part of the property, as by accidentally destroying one nesting site, it is possible to kill up to 400 females and cubs and thereby possibly wipe out the entire local population.
>>srp_Latn<< Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass or harass and destroy their nests.
>>srp_Latn<< Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Blind Mice Protection Fund, encourages the public to get involved and make their contribution.
She says, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we still don’t know how they stand with numbers.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges, lawyers file lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
>>srp_Latn<< His lawyers intend to sue the German magazine Spiegel which published the allegations.
Juventus and Portugal are accused of raping an American woman named Katrin Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
>>srp_Latn<< Reportedly then paid her $375,000 so she wouldn't speak out about the incident, Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing 142 million of his followers in an Instagram Live video after the charges were released, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
>>srp_Latn<< What they said today, fake news," said the five-time Golden Ball winner to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” he added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Spiegel over allegations they described as “unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns.”
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which probably constitutes one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
>>srp_Latn<< The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
>>srp_Latn<< After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to a statement made to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident, claiming that he was "99 percent a good guy" but that he relented because of the "one percent".
>>bos_Latn<< The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple had had sex, but that it was on a voluntary basis.
Majorga said she went to the police with photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court settlement because she felt “a terrible fear of revenge” and worried that she would be “publicly humiliated.”
>>srp_Latn<< This 34-year-old says she now wants to rescind the deal because she still has trauma due to the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was one step away from moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he transferred for 100m euros to Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: UK ‘would never regret’ loss of carmaker
The UK “would never regret it” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, according to Economy Minister Greg Clarke.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily suspend production in Barnaston near Darby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
Japan’s automaker said a border standoff in the case of a no-deal Brexit would cause job losses.
>>srp_Latn<< The plant in Barnaston - which produces toyota auris and avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that we will have a factory shutdown if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March,” said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota’s Barnaston plant.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fear of leaving the EU without an agreement to operate cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month.
>>srp_Latn<< The main reasons for concern relate to the risks related to supply chains in the case of a no-deal Brexit, car manufacturers say.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “right on time” basis, with delivery parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be a deadlock at the border that industry representatives say could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to store the inventory for more than a day at its Darbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted.
Clark says Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid such checks at the border."
“We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow us to, as I would say, not only achieve instant success, but also seize this opportunity,” he told BBC 4’s Today programme.
“The testimonies not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, say that we absolutely must be able to continue what has proven to be a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long it would take to stop production, but cautions that in the long run, a build-up of costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has worked in Barnaston for 24 years and is a United union official at the factory, says its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs are abolished, they will not be opened again.
A government spokesman said: "We have come up with a precise and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s election interference, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will replace the deputy attorney general or not and thus jeopardise Mueller’s independence has been the subject of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing wiretaps to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein dismissed that allegation.
But last Monday he went to the White House, despite announcements that he was about to resign.
>>srp_Latn<< Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "rather not" dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaze Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the entire Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein, she replied: “There is no date yet, it could be this week, it could be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters may dispute the claim: Sanders has not made a press release at the White House since September 10.
>>srp_Latn<< The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the thinning of the statement was not due to a dislike of journalists’ desire to “get attention,” but said: “I wouldn’t refuse to agree with the fact that they like to get attention.”
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would be stepped up.
“The president has more conferences where he answers questions than any other president before him,” she said, without citing sources: “We checked those numbers.”
There will still be announcements, Sanders said, but “if journalists have a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s incomparably better than talking to me.
>>srp_Latn<< We try to do it often and you have seen that we have done it on many occasions over the past weeks and it will happen instead of a press release when you have the opportunity to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or news conferences with visiting officials.
>>srp_Latn<< Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, since he behaved nonchalantly in front of the gathered journalists, and at times bizarrely.
Health minister writes to EU workers at National Health Service of Scotland over fears over Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU staff working at the National Health Service of Scotland to express her country's gratitude and to invite them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MEP Jean Freeman has sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
>>srp_Latn<< The Scottish government has already committed to covering the costs of resolved applications for residence of EU citizens working in its competent public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “The UK’s exit from the EU negotiations continued through the summer, heading towards the expected decisions in the fall.
>>srp_Latn<< But the UK government is also working to prepare for a possible scenario without reaching an agreement.
I know this must be a disturbing time for all of you.
So now I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from different parts of the EU, and beyond, bring us valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
>>srp_Latn<< Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
>>srp_Latn<< Christion Abercrombie urgently operated after suffering head injury
>>srp_Latn<< Linebacker Tennessee State Tigers' Christion Abercrombie was operated on urgently after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
>>srp_Latn<< Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the head injury occurred just before halftime.
“He got to the out line and he just collapsed there,” Reed said.
>>srp_Latn<< Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen in the car before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further testing.
>>srp_Latn<< A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was transported to Vanderbilt Medical Center to be operated.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/seriousness of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
>>srp_Latn<< Abercrombie, a second-year red jersey, is currently in its first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
>>srp_Latn<< On Saturday, he had five tackles before leaving the game, bringing his total number of tackles in a season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher amount of tax stamps when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher amount of taxed stamps when buying real estate in the UK, and additional income will be used to help the homeless in line with the Tories' new plans
This move will offset the success of Corbyn's effort to attract young voters.
The increase in the taxable mark will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
>>srp_Latn<< The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds annually to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher amount of taxed stamps when buying real estate in the UK - and additional income will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
>>srp_Latn<< This move will be interpreted as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in an effort to attract young voters by promising to provide them with more affordable housing and transfer the tax burden to those with high wages.
>>srp_Latn<< The increase in the amount of the taxable stamp will apply to natural and legal persons who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will be used to contribute to the Government's fight against homelessness.
The additional burden - which is added to the already existing taxable mark, including higher amounts introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of rental properties - could be up to 3%.
>>srp_Latn<< The vault expects that up to 120m pounds will be collected annually thanks to this step.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are bought by non-residents of the UK, which raises prices and makes it difficult for people who buy the first home to reach housing.
Many wealthy parts of the country - especially the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
>>srp_Latn<< The new regulation comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the taxable mark to help young people reach their first home.
He accused major construction firms of holding high property prices by seizing land but not using it, and urged Prime Minister May to scrap affordable housing quotas to correct Britain’s “shame on living space.”
>>srp_Latn<< Corbyn announced a striking array of housing reform proposals, including rent control and an end to unjustified eviction.
>>srp_Latn<< It also wants to give the committees more authority to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministerial term to renewing the British dream of making life better for every new generation.
And that includes solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
>>srp_Latn<< However, it cannot be right for buying real estate to be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign companies as it is for working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, while the humiliation of homelessness has become too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's national team manager at some point.
>>srp_Latn<< The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of reviving a club from the northeast that is currently in third place of the major leagues, three points from the top.
>>srp_Latn<< This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after St Mirren returned to the Scottish Premiership League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
>>srp_Latn<< I was in the B-team of the national team and that's it," Ross told Sportsound on the Scottish BBC.
“But I grew up often watching Scotland on Hempden with my father when I was little and that was something I always came back to.
>>srp_Latn<< However, such an opportunity would only be provided if I was successful in running the club."
>>srp_Latn<< Ross' predecessors as Sanderland managers include Dick Lawyer, David Moyses, Sam Allerdice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keene, Gus Poyet and Paolo di Kani.
>>srp_Latn<< The former head of Aloe athletics says he is not fearful because he comes after such big names in such a big club, after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town .
“The measure of success at this point will be whether I will be able to get this club back into the Premier League.
According to the structure and capabilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I think I’ll only be able to consider myself successful if I can get the club back where it belongs.”
>>srp_Latn<< Ross was only in the third year of his managerial career, after a period he spent as assistant chief at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Harts' coaching staff.
>>srp_Latn<< He then helped recover Aloa from falling into the third division, and St Mirren led from the edge of falling into the minor leagues to winning the championship the following season.
>>srp_Latn<< Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he said, recalling the club's takeover of Aloa.
“I really believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I was not bad, I made a solid profit from it and I enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through it in terms of stress and job pressures, but management just works for me.
I’ve always wanted to be in management and now I’m doing it, in my entire adult life I haven’t felt more comfortable than I do now.”

The perfect time for a mug is 17.30 on Saturdays, research reveals
>>bos_Latn<< The summer heat wave increased traffic for British pubs struggling to survive, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In the pubs and bars group, sales grew by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant sales fell by 4.8 percent, as the figures show.
Peter Martin of CGA, a consulting firm that handled the figures, said: “Permanent sunny weather and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup contributed to July following a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when pubs grew by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants had an even greater decline.
>>srp_Latn<< The 1.8% drop in restaurant traffic in June only further deteriorated in July.
>>bos_Latn<< Pubs and drinks-focused bars had by far the best effect with greater growth compared to comparable results from the previous period than there had been a decline in restaurant traffic.
>>srp_Latn<< Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
I guess people just wanted to go out for a drink.
>>srp_Latn<< Pub and bar chains increased liquor sales by 6.6 percent in a month, with 3% food sales falling."
Paul Newman, RSM’s entertainment and hospitality analysis agency, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
>>srp_Latn<< Weather conditions and the impact of major social and sporting events remain major factors when it comes to sales in the market outside of the household.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8% annual drop in sales will be particularly painful with already-present price pressures.
>>srp_Latn<< The long hot summer could not come at a worse time for food-focused caterers, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide little needed relief."
>>srp_Latn<< Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industrial sales tracking service for bars, pubs and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 business groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is an accepted industry rapper.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has a secret social media account that hides from their parents and educators, according to a new study.
A survey of more than 20,000 primary school students found an increase in the number of “fake Insta” pages
The news has heightened fears of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” order to show their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, makes accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 upper-class elementary school students revealed a sharp increase in “fake Insta” accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
>>srp_Latn<< The news heightened fears of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean “main” account that they show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website discovered a teenage girl calling out to others with the words “rape me.”
>>srp_Latn<< A survey conducted by the UK Digital Awareness Organization and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18 year olds had two profiles, while half of them admitted to owning private accounts.
HMC president Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create space online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Ailee Doyle to be 'Voice of Athletes' on Scottish Athletics Committee
>>srp_Latn<< Ailey Doyle was elected a member of the Scottish Athletic Board as a non-executive director at the annual general session of that governing body.
>>srp_Latn<< Doyle is Scotland's most awarded athlete and chairman Ian Beatty described this move as a great opportunity for those running the sport to gain the benefit of her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Aily enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from her membership of the board,” she said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of the athlete and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."

Thank you for your messages of encouragement.”
An advertisement for a milk pump in which mothers compare themselves to cows shared opinions on the Internet
>>srp_Latn<< The company that manufactures the milking pumps shared opinions on the internet with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to dairy cows.
To mark the launch of a product that has been described as “the first silent milking pump to be worn under a bra,” consumer tech maker Elvie has released a humorous advertisement showing the freedom the new pump provides to milking mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn among hay and cows with a song that reads: “Yes, I’m milking but I don’t have a tail” and “You may not have noticed, but it’s not udders, it’s my boobs.”
The chorus continues: “Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, milk myself.”
>>srp_Latn<< However, an advertisement posted on the firm's Facebook page caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions from viewers, while many said it downplayed the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are snatched away a few days after birth.”
Elvie discreetly fits into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: “It’s clearly traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
>>srp_Latn<< But yeah, why don't we use it to advertise a pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added, “That’s a pretty good advertisement.”
Others sided with the commercial, and one woman admitted that her song was “hilarious.”
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd get this if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I got it right.
“This is a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at moms milking (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feeling like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or insults the dairy industry."
>>bos_Latn<< At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they have all danced with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many milk-milking mothers say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, there is no wire or pipe and fits in a nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while milking.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk milking and all the challenges that go with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie pump made headlines.
>>srp_Latn<< During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the runway with the creation of Martha Yakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has skyrocketed despite monthly border crossings remaining relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and regulations introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to find guardians.
>>srp_Latn<< Traditionally, most caregivers themselves have been undocumented migrants who are afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by stepping up to accept a child.
>>srp_Latn<< The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration services.
Senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albens told Congress last week that the service had arrested dozens of people who had applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
>>srp_Latn<< The service later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not previously been convicted.
“Nearly 80 percent of the persons who are either guardians or members of the guardians’ household are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners with criminal offences.
>>srp_Latn<< Therefore, we will continue to pursue those faces," Albens said.
In an effort to get the children through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules under which some of them will have to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, the shelter workers said.
Many will report by video instead of in person to ask an immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who are found not to meet the requirements will be deported quickly.
The longer children stay locked up, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to an outburst of anger or an attempt to escape, according to shelter workers and reports coming from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such risks are raised in larger institutions such as the one in Thornill, where size makes it much easier to overlook signs that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without providing enough time for emotional preparation or goodbyes from friends can intensify the traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also urged Syrian refugees to return, although the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign powers were illegal on the Syrian land, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will deal with them appropriately."
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said at the meeting.
Muallem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue its “holy struggle until all Syrian terrorists are exterminated,” including terrorist groups and “every foreign presence.”
>>srp_Latn<< The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, tasked mainly with training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
When it comes to refugees, Muallem said there were good conditions for their return and blamed “some Western countries” for “spreading irrational fears” that would not allow refugees to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to make this return possible," he said.
“They are politicizing something that would be a purely humanitarian issue.”
>>bos_Latn<< The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement deterred a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be launched against the jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the government and opposition members soon in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the Syrian government's conditions for participation in the committee, saying the committee's work would be limited to "considering the members of the current constitution" and threatened the possibility of interference from the side.
Why Trump Will Be Elected for a Second Term
By that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal terminate his term earlier.
This would undoubtedly represent “the most dramatic end to the presidency of all time!”
So far, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
>>srp_Latn<< As of 2014, the primetime rating more than doubled, to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC channel.
>>srp_Latn<< According to the Nielsen news agency, the Fox News channel has an average 2.4 million viewers on primetime, compared to four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and the Rachel Meadow show from MSNBC exceeded the ratings of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during primetime news evenings.
“It’s a flame that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neil Bear, producer of the ABC drama “Selected Survivors,” about the minister who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol building.
Nell Scowell, a longtime comedy author and writer of Only Funny Parts: And a Few Cruel Truths About Getting Into The Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
>>srp_Latn<< She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Skovelova told me.
It also has a fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can decide the future of important court cases, whether immigrant families will be able to merge and what the state of the global economy will be.
>>srp_Latn<< Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you’ve gone a little further than general awareness when you realize you’ve spent six hours watching a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used the “deep background” for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s pilot’s leather jacket made of ostrich leather, worth $15,000 (“a suit with a thick set of hubris,” as the Washington Post put it), and the implications of an overly graphic description of Trump.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Part of what he does, which makes the reality show feel like a reality show, is he gives you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, general manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, commenting on the rotation of the cast and the daily plot of the Trump show (criticizing the American Football League, praising Kim Jong-un).

>>srp_Latn<< When I got to Mr. Fleece this week, outside his house on the north coast of Kauai it was sunny, 27 degrees, but he shut himself in and watched MSNBC while filming CNN.
>>srp_Latn<< He could not break away from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and while his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
“I remember back when we were doing all those crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” he told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Large foreign money inflow in the most uncertain election race for the House of Representatives in the middle of the term
Unsurprisingly, the influx of money swept through Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district, thanks to a redrawing of the boundaries that put two officials in the race for the same position.
>>srp_Latn<< The recent redrawing of the district's boundaries in the Pittsburgh suburbs has led to the election of Democratic Representative Connor Lem, who came to the head of another district after an early election last spring .
>>srp_Latn<< Lem is up against another official, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
>>srp_Latn<< The maps were corrected after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided so that the vote went in favor of the Republicans.
>>srp_Latn<< The election race in the new 17th district launched a fierce bidding campaign to fund the campaign between major party financiers, the Democratic Congressional Election Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Election Committee (NRCC).
>>srp_Latn<< Lem became a sonorous name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in March's snap election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district that garnered much attention.
He was a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a margin of 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
US considers punishing El Salvador for supporting China, then quits
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing's position, without particularly negative reaction from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump administration team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to withdraw Taiwan’s recognition,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
>>srp_Latn<< But the sanctions were only considered in the case of El Salvador, which received U.S. aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, among others for drug control, development and economic support.
>>srp_Latn<< The proposed sanctions, which included the cessation of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hit this Central American country hard with high unemployment and murder rates.
>>srp_Latn<< As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was to be a continuation of a similar last year's rally that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants into the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials have made it clear they want the conference to take place and thus put an end to any consideration of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was announced as a speaker at a conference now scheduled for mid-October as a signal of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats said.

>>srp_Latn<< Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition that they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Studying History
The next bad news could come in the form of a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller about a possible Trump obstruction of justice, for which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also reportedly turning the investigation into a possible link between Trump’s campaign and Russia’s attack on U.S. elections.
If Congress becomes second-hand, Trump could face responsibility in that body, just as he is preparing to go before the voters again, and possibly before a jury.
There are a lot of “ifs” involved, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor his downfall in Europe.
There are choices that each of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make that will determine how long the fight will last.
>>srp_Latn<< In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, only that the West had given him resistance and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
>>srp_Latn<< We made a mistake and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
>>srp_Latn<< The course of history revolves around such turning points at which the unstoppable march of history accelerates or slows down.
>>bos_Latn<< Americans are now faced with multiple such breakpoints.
What will we do if Trump removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the future of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an awkward position since the newspaper reported last year that he had proposed a covert shooting of the president and made speculation that he was unfit to hold office.
>>srp_Latn<< Rosenstein said the Times statement was incorrect.
“How will we react if the FBI’s recently sought investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair- or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And on top of that, are we going to vote in midterm elections for a Congress that will seek Trump’s responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the country where I am ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light candles on the Sabbath on that swastika table.

Rangers player Graham Dorans optimistic ahead of Rapida match from Vienna
>>srp_Latn<< The Rangers will host Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will put them in a good position to qualify for the Europa League from Group G.
>>srp_Latn<< A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from making his debut this season until a tie with Villareal finishing 2-2, but he is confident that the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for progress.
“It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game believing we could do something and we went with a point.
Maybe we could have made it to the end, but overall, the tie was probably fair.
>>srp_Latn<< They were probably better in the first half, and we came back in the second and we were better.
We have a big European evening coming up on Thursday.
We hope that we can take three points, but it will be a difficult match because they had a good result in the last game, although, if the audience supports us, I am sure that we can get through and achieve a positive result.
The past year has undoubtedly been tough, starting with everything that has happened with my injuries to the club changes, but now we are satisfied with what we have at the moment.
>>srp_Latn<< The team is in good shape and the boys are really enjoying it; we're training well.
I hope we can move forward now, put the previous season behind us and make it a success.”
Women can’t sleep with worry about retirement savings
>>srp_Latn<< Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they would like to be taken care of, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of people surveyed by Nationwide said they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they don’t want to start a conversation about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to give you care if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
>>srp_Latn<< Collaborate with your counselor and your family and consider where and how to be provided with care, as such decisions can be a significant factor in pricing.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-backed hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover those costs or self-insurance with your own savings - provided you have enough money.
>>srp_Latn<< Prepare your legal documents: Prevent running legal battles.
Make medical care decision-making authority so that you have an authorized trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals act according to your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider signing a financial power of attorney agreement.
This includes choosing a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and making sure your bills are paid if you remain powerless.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine your aging parent getting sick and being rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please provide this information in writing so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin says.
“What medications are used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Plan it out."
Man shot in Ilfrakum with multiple shots from air rifle
>>bos_Latn<< One man was shot with multiple shots from an air rifle as he was walking home from an evening out.
>>srp_Latn<< The victim, a male in his 40s, was in a section of Ilfracum in Devon named Oxford Grove, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place at around 2.30 a.m. British summer time, as "random".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
>>srp_Latn<< His injuries are not life-threatening, and police have appealed for witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
>>srp_Latn<< At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
>>srp_Latn<< Due to communications interruptions, rescuers failed to obtain any information from the Dongala area, an area north of Palu that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
>>bos_Latn<< Over 16,000 people in Palu were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulavesi:
>>srp_Latn<< Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
>>bos_Latn<< The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
>>srp_Latn<< Dongala is an area extending along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
>>srp_Latn<< The area which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
>>srp_Latn<< Fishing and agriculture form the basis of the economy in Central Sulawesi Province, and especially in the coastal part of Dongale.
>>srp_Latn<< Nickel mines are also important in this province, but they are mostly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management.
>>bos_Latn<< In 1938 a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
>>srp_Latn<< The tsunami struck the western part of Dongala again in 1996 and killed nine people.
>>srp_Latn<< Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Belt of Fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
>>srp_Latn<< 2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half in the province of Aceh.
>>srp_Latn<< 2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
>>srp_Latn<< Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
>>srp_Latn<< 2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
>>srp_Latn<< 2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra and triggered a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
>>srp_Latn<< 2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya area of Aceh and caused destruction and panic reminding people of the destruction caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but over 100 people lost their lives in the collapse of buildings.
>>srp_Latn<< 2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing over 500 people, predominantly on the north side of the island.
>>srp_Latn<< The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
>>srp_Latn<< Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attack.
Paileen, 29, from Vasile in Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing family violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released by Alaska police on Saturday.
>>srp_Latn<< According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
>>srp_Latn<< Peylin was detained in the Mat-Su detention unit and was granted a $500 conditional bail, the KTUU channel reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "not guilty, certainly" when asked to plead guilty, the channel said.
>>srp_Latn<< Peylin is facing three Class A violations, meaning he is threatened with a prison sentence of up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
>>srp_Latn<< He was also charged with a Class B offense, which is punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time a criminal case has been filed against Palin.
>>srp_Latn<< In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
>>srp_Latn<< His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
>>srp_Latn<< The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
>>srp_Latn<< In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reporting of domestic violence and handling of weapons in an alcoholic state in the course of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
>>srp_Latn<< In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran associations after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia causes tsunami: hundreds dead
>>srp_Latn<< At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
>>srp_Latn<< A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
>>srp_Latn<< There has been a disruption in telecommunications and electricity supply, and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
>>srp_Latn<< The epicenter of the earthquake was right next to the central part of Sulawesi located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for New York terror suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Cyful Saipov, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the country since 1953 because of a federal crime.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck to attack a bike lane along the western highway in lower Manhattan, shooting down pedestrians and cyclists who got in his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious bodily harm, according to a death penalty request filed in the Southern District of New York.
>>srp_Latn<< Both of these points bear the possibility of sentencing the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a grand federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including 8 counts of racketeering-related murder, which federal prosecutors usually raise in organized crime cases and charges of violent behavior and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov had carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
“Sajfulo Habibulayevich Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Lor Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferucci, Ern Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Panyuk,” the court said in a statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s Southern District last had a death penalty case.
>>srp_Latn<< Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
>>srp_Latn<< The last death sentence in a federal case in New York City was carried out in 1953 over Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
>>srp_Latn<< Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
>>srp_Latn<< According to court documents, Saipov showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
>>srp_Latn<< He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
>>srp_Latn<< Saipov said he got inspiration for the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
>>srp_Latn<< He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
>>srp_Latn<< He stated that he does not accept blame on any of the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "visibly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without the possibility of acquittal will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved,” Patton said.
>>srp_Latn<< Saipov's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should head Brexit talks
Nigel Farage has vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at a Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must “feel discontent” with Eurosceptics, while one of May’s MPs suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have "already come out" if Farage had been the secretary in charge of Brexit.
But the challenge Prime Minister May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided membership was highlighted by Tories who advocate staying in the EU and who staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to salvage her compromise plan from the Chequers, despite attacks by both supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The allies insist that she will continue to make efforts to reach a deal with Brussels, despite negative reactions - and force eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos.
Boun told a rally in Solihala that he wanted to drop the plan from the Chequers.
>>srp_Latn<< He suggested that Farage should have been given the nobility and be in charge of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
The MP from Wellingborough added, “I will support Brexit, but we have to reject the Checkers.”
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight wars to be subordinates.
>>srp_Latn<< We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
A supporter of Brexit, Andrea Jenkins, who also attended the rally, told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who are actually sparring with the streets and allow us to be elected at all.
“Please drop the plan from the Checkers and start listening.”
In her criticism of Prime Minister May, she added: “Prime Ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the crowd that politicians must “feel discontent” if they were about to cheat on the promise they made in the 2016 referendum.
"It's about trust between us - the people - and our political elite," he said.
“They’re trying to play Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we’re not going to let you get away with it.’
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to get our political elite, who are one step away from playing Brexit, to feel discontent.
“We are mobilizing the People’s Army in this country that has given us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
>>srp_Latn<< Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
A handful of activists waved banners at Tories against Brexit after the group formed this weekend.
>>srp_Latn<< A nobleman from the ranks of Labour, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservatives at the start of the conference for the security problems they had with the party application.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus plan, for the invisible border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
A good Brexit is not possible," he added.
Warren plans to think hard about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she “will think hard about running for president” after the November election.
>>srp_Latn<< The Boston Globe reported that a representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future at a meeting with the city administration in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Representative Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There is speculation around her that she could run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday night's rally in Holjok was her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a conference with the city administration since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and take care of our dysfunctional government, and that includes the woman at the top.”
The shooting that killed LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in a shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
>>srp_Latn<< A police station in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dajon Simpson (20) at a press conference at 11.00 Eastern American time.
>>bos_Latn<< They released a video of Friday's shooting and sought help in identifying the man seen in the video.
>>srp_Latn<< Sims (20) was shot and killed near the campus of Sadern University early on Friday.
“Wade Simms was shot in the head and succumbed to his injuries,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to the 247sports portal.
>>srp_Latn<< Wade stood up for his friend when Simpson shot him.
>>srp_Latn<< Simpson admitted on interrogation that he was on the scene, that he owned a weapon, and that he shot Wade Simms.
>>srp_Latn<< Simpson was arrested without resisting and was given detention at a police station in the East Baton Rouge municipality.
>>srp_Latn<< Sim, a 198 cm tall young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games of which 10 in the first lineup, with an average of 17.4 minutes on the field, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
>>srp_Latn<< Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton neared the World Champion title after following team tactics to win over Sebastian Fetel.
>>srp_Latn<< As soon as Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team tactics would play a major role in the race.
>>srp_Latn<< Bottas got off to a good start from the pole position, almost leaving Lewis Hamilton in the lurch as he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Fettel to attack a member of his team.
>>srp_Latn<< Vettel entered the pit-stop first and left Hamilton running into the crowd from the rear of the group, which was to be decisive.
>>srp_Latn<< Mercedes' team went into the pit-stop on the next lap and found themselves behind Fetel but Hamilton fronted after a wheel contact that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the inside position risking the position after a double move in an attempt to defend on the third turn.
>>srp_Latn<< Max Verstappen started from the back row on his 21st birthday and was seventh at the end of the first round.
>>srp_Latn<< He was then in the lead for most of the race and relied on tyres to get close to victory quickly and beat Kimi Rykonen in fourth position.
>>srp_Latn<< He eventually went to the pit-stop in the 44th round but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight laps, and Rykonen took the fourth position.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri was a great guy all weekend, a real gentleman for letting me go.
>>srp_Latn<< The team achieved a lot by taking 1st and 2nd place," Hamilton said.
Very poor body language
President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked Senator Diane Feinstein for insisting that a letter from Christine Blaze Ford in which he accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct had not been leaked by her.
In his address in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but made a comment that the events in the Senate were proof that people were "evil, vicious and not telling the truth."
“The only thing that can happen is the wonderful thing that’s been going on in the past few days in the Senate, when you see anger, you see people who are angry, mean, mean, and don’t tell the truth,” he said.
“When you look at the posts and the leaked information, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak any information?
Remember her answer... Did a leaked document come from you?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute.
>>srp_Latn<< Did we publish them...No, we didn't," he added imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh, which was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak from her office.
“I didn’t wing Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t run her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to Hill magazine.
“She told me that the information should remain confidential and I did as she asked.”
However, her denial to the president was unconvincing, and he commented at Saturday's rally: "You know what, that was really bad body language.
>>srp_Latn<< She may not be guilty, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
>>srp_Latn<< In further defense of the Supreme Court member candidate, whom the three women accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, the president indicated that Democrats were using these allegations to their own advantage.
“They wanted to regain power without having to choose the means.
>>srp_Latn<< All this malice and spite; they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to reign and take control again," said the president according to the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dandi Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
>>srp_Latn<< Two goals by Patrick Dwyer for the Giants against Dundee
>>srp_Latn<< With Saturday's rematch win against Dundee by a score of 5-3, the Dundee Stars team made up for a losing game against the Giants of Belfast in an Elite League game that took place on Friday.
>>srp_Latn<< Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier led the Giants team into the lead at the very beginning by scoring two.
>>srp_Latn<< Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowney helped the home team tie the score before Dwyer brought the Giants team into the lead again.
>>srp_Latn<< Francois Buccard tied the score for the Dandies before Lucas Lunwald Nielsen's two goals ensured their victory.
>>srp_Latn<< It was the third defeat for Adam Keefe's team this season in the Elite League, who had to fight to win after losing 2–1 last night in Belfast.
>>srp_Latn<< The two teams have met four times this season, and the Giants have claimed victory in all three previous matches.
>>srp_Latn<< Dwyer's scoring opened the match in the fourth minute (3.35) with Kendal McFaul's assist, while David Rutherford assisted Bovilier and doubled the lead four minutes later.
>>srp_Latn<< In the crowd at the start, Sullivan returned the home team to the game in the 13th minute and 10th seconds before Matt Markwart helped Kauni to a tie in the 15th minute and 16th seconds.
>>srp_Latn<< Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break after also giving a second goal that evening at the end of the first period.
>>srp_Latn<< The home team regrouped so Bukard tied again with a goal in the power play in the 27th minute and 37th seconds.
>>srp_Latn<< Cowney and Charles Corcoran teamed up and helped Nilsen bring the Dandies into the lead for the first time in this game and towards the very end of the second period, thus ensuring his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the final period.
>>srp_Latn<< The Giants team, which has lost four of its last five matches so far, will welcome the Milton Kinz team to the game in front of a home crowd on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while providing hundreds of passengers on board to avoid earthquake
>>srp_Latn<< An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero after he passed away while ensuring the safe take-off of an aircraft with several hundred people.
More than 800 people died and a large number went missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulavesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to occur in the area, and a large number of faces are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
>>srp_Latn<< Despite his colleagues escaping to save their own lives, Antonius Gunavan Agung (21) refused to leave the workplace at Mutiara Airport's Sis Al Juffrey control tower in Palu rocking under the impact of the earthquake.
He didn’t want to leave his post until the plane on Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, took off safely.
He then jumped off the control tower thinking it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
>>srp_Latn<< Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirajt concluded that the decision saved hundreds of people's lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
>>bos_Latn<< We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts broke when we heard the news,” Sirajt added.
Meanwhile, local authorities fear the death toll will reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency warns that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The death toll is thought to be on the rise as many bodies are still under the rubble, and a large number of people are difficult to reach," the agency's spokesman, Purvo Nugroho, said in a statement.
Waves that reached a height of up to six meters have devastated the city of Palu, where a mass burial of earthquake victims will take place on Sunday.
>>srp_Latn<< Military and commercial aviation brings aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency cars bring in bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Stores are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hastily to provide assistance to survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This in itself is a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesia’s President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night and to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports one man missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline, whose plane crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, has now reported the disappearance of a man, following a previous statement that 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In its press release, Air Niugini said it had not been able to locate the passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline says it is looking for a missing man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
At first, they did not respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
>>srp_Latn<< Other passengers and crew members were rescued by local boats after the plane hit the surface of the water in an attempt to land at Chuk Island Airport.
>>srp_Latn<< Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
>>srp_Latn<< The airline said six passengers were detained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
>>bos_Latn<< The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy allege that the plane landed in the lagoon, failing to make it to the runway.
>>srp_Latn<< Some witnesses thought the plane had flown over the runway.
>>srp_Latn<< US passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Janes said.
Janes said he and other passengers were able to make their way from the sinking water plane to the emergency exit.
>>srp_Latn<< He said the plane's crew was in a panic and shouted and he sustained a slight head injury.
>>srp_Latn<< Members of the U.S. Navy who were working to repair the pier near the crash site also helped rescue using an inflatable boat carrying passengers ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them have been involved in Air Niugini.
An analyst recreated the sequence of events on the night the woman was burned alive.
>>srp_Latn<< The prosecution brought the case on Saturday in a repeat trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Roulet has spoken for hours in testimony as a court expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury that he used a list of phone calls to draw up a picture of the whereabouts of the accused Quinton Tellis, 29, and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19, during the night she died.
>>bos_Latn<< Roulet said he had received location information based on several phone calls that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claim, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
>>srp_Latn<< When information from Chambers' phone showed that he was at that point with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
>>srp_Latn<< Sanford was called to testify on Saturday and stated that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis had told the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy is that Tellis stated that he had met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The information about the phone calls indicates that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulet said at the time of Chambers's death, Tellis had deleted messages he had exchanged with her, a list of calls and her contact.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
>>bos_Latn<< The final defense is scheduled for Sunday.
>>srp_Latn<< The judge said he expected the trial to be in front of a jury later the same day.
Q: What is hip-hop?
>>srp_Latn<< The hip-hop trio seeks to change the negative view of that music genre by filling their compositions with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band Hy-brid claims that hip-hop has moved away from its original political messages and sensitive social issues.
>>srp_Latn<< The band wants to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
>>srp_Latn<< Artists like Fujiz and Komon rose again in the UK through artists like Akala and Louki.
Another black person?
New York nanny sues couple for firing after 'racist' text message
The New York nanny sued the couple for dismissal on a discriminatory basis after receiving a message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist, calling the lawsuit an act of "extortion."
>>srp_Latn<< Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction after learning that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was a black-skinned person, upon her first arrival at the new job in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEE ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Ms Plasko-Flaskman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent it to Morris twice.
When she became aware of the gaffe, Plasko-Flaxman felt uneasy and fired Morris, stating that the friendly nanny, who is African-American, was doing her job badly and was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Morris received a workday fee and was sent home via Uber.
Now Morris is seeking damages for the couple's dismissal, as well as $350 per day for a six-month period during which she was to live with her family, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them it’s not right to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
>>srp_Latn<< The couple responded to the racism charge that the cancellation of Morris's contract was reasonable because they felt they could not trust her after offending her.
Her husband sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
>>srp_Latn<< We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasko told the Post newspaper.
“Would you leave your children in the care of the person you have offended, even if by mistake?”
Your newborn?
Come on, please."
Citing the lawsuit as an act of "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth only two months ago and was "in a very difficult situation".
“Do you want to pursue someone like her?”
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the process is still ongoing, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media for their behavior and thinking.
New letter reveals: Paddington publisher feared readers would not identify with talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to look at a thing with the eyes of another person reading something for the first time before it’s published.
>>srp_Latn<< It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's tremendous success."
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a book for children about a small teddy bear, would blush when his book was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bittersweet" because her father passed away last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family.”
“He was quiet, he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“Since Paddington was considered real, it was almost as if your child achieved something that you are proud of, even though you are not responsible for it.
I think that's how he saw Padingtin's success.
>>srp_Latn<< Although it was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed all success to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye over the phone.
>>srp_Latn<< On landing, her daughter was sent to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that she was very ill, that they didn’t expect her to survive,” said Ednan-Laperuz.
“Nad called me to tell me he was going to die in two minutes and that we should say goodbye.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
We'll be together soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and no longer flowed through the bloodstream.
She passed away a few moments before, and everything just shut down.
I just sat there and waited, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t cry and grieve because I was surrounded by family and other people.
>>srp_Latn<< I had to pull myself together."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, now grieving the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers - completely unaware of the horrors she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I lowered my head and tears were pouring down my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but over the summer, I was overcome by compassion for Hope.
I knew he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sorrowful women leave motivational messages to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to prevent people from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys left inspirational messages and phone numbers on the bridge in Wales that people could call and ask for support.
>>srp_Latn<< Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, who was 13 when he fell into depression, took his own life at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a cook in his infancy and had an infectious smile.
“He was known for his smile.
Everyone said he'd light up the room he was walking into every time."
However, he resigned before his death after being "in a very dark mood".
>>srp_Latn<< In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after a suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always afraid it's going to have consequences for him."
She made these messages “so that people would know that there are people everywhere who are going through the same problems and with whom they can talk, even with friends.
Don’t just sit there and talk.”
>>srp_Latn<< Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark after 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t complain about being moody, depressed, or anything like that,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was acting differently.
At Christmas he was in the worst shape - when the children opened the presents he didn't even look at them."
She added that Mark's death was a grave trauma for the children, but they had to overcome it.
We were broken.
>>srp_Latn<< But we had to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain at start of FBI investigation
"I thought that if we could really get something like what he was looking for -- an investigation of limited duration and scope -- we might be able to unite," Ms Flake said on Saturday, adding that she feared the committee was "disintegrating" due to unswerving party disagreements.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican support want the FBI to start an investigation?
>>bos_Latn<< Their hesitation is caused by a time limit.
>>srp_Latn<< The midterm elections will be held in just a few weeks - November 6 - if Republicans meet expectations and fare poorly they will be severely weakened in an attempt to have their candidate elected to the highest judicial position in the country.
>>srp_Latn<< George W. Bush made calls to the Senators, convincing them to support Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will put it to a vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, giving Vice President Mike Pence the chance to prevail in a tie and make him a member of the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors from North Korea falls under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean refugees has fallen since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the South’s legislature said.
Park Bjeong-Sug, citing South Korea's Unification Ministry data, said there were 1,127 defectors last year, while there were 2706 in 2011.
>>srp_Latn<< Mr Park believes that the two decisive factors are stronger control of the borders between North Korea and China and an increase in smuggling tariffs.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements on the matter.
>>srp_Latn<< The vast majority of North Korean defectors end up receiving South Korean citizenship.
>>srp_Latn<< From Seoul, more than 30,000 North Korean nationals have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most avoid China, with which North Korea shares most of its border, and which is easier to cross than a protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
>>srp_Latn<< China regards the refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on delaying talks on stopping the use of nuclear weapons.
The event follows a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to work to make the Korean peninsula nuclear-free.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho blamed U.S. sanctions on insufficient progress.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way for us to disarm ourselves first,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he is not fit to work with the Supreme Court.
U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for the Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said she was unfit for Supreme Court service because of her temperament.
Pelosi made her comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but notice that if a woman acted like that, they would call her ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
>>srp_Latn<< Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christina Blaze Ford while they were both teenagers.
During his initial exposure, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and choking during the story of his family and high school days.
He also strongly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated attack on his reputation" led by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
>>bos_Latn<< Pelosi says she thought Kavanaugh's testimony proved she could not work for the Supreme Court because it showed his bias regarding dissent with Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself from those statements and the way he treated the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
>>srp_Latn<< Pelosi timidly answered the question of whether she would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's impeachment if his candidacy was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this: If he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be in the Supreme Court, he's not fit to be in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
>>srp_Latn<< Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Rotary Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
>>srp_Latn<< Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings regarding the health care bill or in the case of Rowe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
>>srp_Latn<< When making a statement to confirm the candidature, Cavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would recast certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for hysterical, biased people to work in court and expect us to say to them, 'Isn't that wonderful?'" she said.
And women have to deal with it.
Blasphemy, months and years of rage spilling over, and she can't get it out of her without crying.
“Women cry when they’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me after 45 years.
“I don’t think that’s a rare occurrence, do you?”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who told me that she also cried when she got angry but developed a technique: when she got angry and cried, she would say to the interviewer: ‘You must think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she'd just keep going.
>>bos_Latn<< And that was genius to me."
Tears are a allowed way to express anger in part because we don’t understand their essence.
One of the strongest memories I have from my previous job at a male-dominated office and where I once cried out with incredible ferocity was when an older woman grabbed me by the neck -- a cold-blooded executive I'd always been afraid of -- and pulled me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a congresswoman from the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
>>srp_Latn<< In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business so he withdrew from the election race, Mrs. Schroeder who was heavily defeated realized that there was no reason not to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race and only one was missing.
Someone called this race 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'".
Since it happened near the end of the campaign, she did not have enough finances, and vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was doomed.
She learned that people who donated $1,000 to men in support of her gave only $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?” she asked.
When she made a speech announcing that she would not formally campaign, she was overcome by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than their representatives and anger over chauvinism - and she began to choke.
“You’d think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalls the press reaction to her behavior.
“You’d think that paper handkerchief manufacturers are my general sponsors.
I remember thinking about what they were going to put on my headstone.
“She was crying a lot.”
How a trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The U.S.-China trade war was stupefying, and with no end of the battle looming, the gap between the two countries may be favorable for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key items imported from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant coup took place this week when new tariffs on $200 billion ($150 billion) worth of items were put in place that effectively tax half of the goods coming into the United States from China.
Beijing retaliated with the same measure each time, and the latest example is the imposition of a five to ten percent tariff on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to return the United States for dear, and the world’s second-largest economy will not even blink in the near future.
To force Washington to withdraw would mean accepting the request, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the next move correctly, U.S. pressures in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China's weakening interdependence between the two economies.
“The mere fact that Washington’s hasty political decision could create conditions for an economic whirlwind to begin in one of the two countries is actually far more dangerous than analysts had predicted,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by the war that has been going on for more than seven years.
>>srp_Latn<< In his speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al Mualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground today is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The state administration continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore a normal way of life.
All signs were obtained for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the establishment of unilateral economic measures that were directed against their lives and daily living needs.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
>>srp_Latn<< The remaining six million residents still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem says the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
>>srp_Latn<< However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
>>srp_Latn<< The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup in France, defeating the team from the United States by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le golf nasional field near Paris.
>>srp_Latn<< The U.S. has thus racked up six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
>>srp_Latn<< Europe regained the crown after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points, which they needed to overcome the United States.
>>srp_Latn<< The team's star from the United States, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tournament, threw the ball into the water at the 16th par-3 hole and surrendered his match to Francesco Molinari.
>>srp_Latn<< Italian golfer Molinari was featured in all rounds and became one of four players with a score of 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in its current format, in 1979.
>>srp_Latn<< American Jordan Spit lost 5-4 to the lowest ranked player on the European team, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
>>srp_Latn<< The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2–1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
>>srp_Latn<< Veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the best European tournament winner of all time with a career score of 25.5.
“I rarely cry, but today I can’t stand it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m very happy, very happy that we won the cup again.
Here is the important team and I am glad that I was able to help," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
>>srp_Latn<< He hands the relay to his countryman John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2–1 in individual matches on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man," Ram, 23, said.
>>srp_Latn<< Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
>>srp_Latn<< Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who has won 14 greatest titles and is only behind Jack Nicklas.
>>srp_Latn<< The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find their way to the hole, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played quality golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furick said after his team's disappointing game: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we were putting pressure on Europe.
We failed.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
>>bos_Latn<< All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the Professional Golfers' Alliance of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're outplayed."
Algae Flowering News: Algae Concentration in Decline in Pinelas, Manati, and Sarasota
>>srp_Latn<< The latest report from the Florida Fish and Natural Habitat Commission notes a general decline in the concentration of red algae blooms in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
>>srp_Latn<< According to the Board, scattered flowering has been observed in the areas of Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier County - indicating a decline in concentrations.
>>srp_Latn<< The area that the blooming algae covers is about 210 km of coastline from Pinelas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
>>srp_Latn<< Groups of flowering algae extend to about 10 miles (16 km) off the coast of Hillsboro County, but to fewer locations compared to the previous week.
>>srp_Latn<< Algae blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
>>srp_Latn<< Last week, medium concentration was reported on the banks of Pinelas County or alongside them, low to high concentration at the banks of Hillsboro County, average to high concentration in Manati County, average to high concentration on the banks of Sarasota County or alongside them, average to medium concentration in Charlotte County, average to high concentration at the banks of Lee County or alongside them and low concentration in Collier County.
>>srp_Latn<< Respiratory irritation is still reported in Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
>>srp_Latn<< Airway irritation has not been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
