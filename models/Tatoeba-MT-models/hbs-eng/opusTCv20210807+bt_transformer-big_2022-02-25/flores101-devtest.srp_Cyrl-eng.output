>>srp_Cyrl<< In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on QVC, a TV shopping channel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ring also reached a court agreement with rival security company, ADT Corporation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although one experimental vaccine appears to be effective in reducing Ebola mortality, so far no medication has proven adequate to treat an already existing infection.
>>srp_Cyrl<< An antibody cocktail called ZMapp was initially promising but official studies have shown that it is not as effective in preventing Ebola mortality as expected after all.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the examination, PALM ZMapp served for control, meaning that scientists used it as a starting point and compared three other treatments with it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Gymnastics Federation of the United States supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We agree with the statement of the USOC that in the interest of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, it would be better to continue with significant changes within our organization, rather than to come up with a dessert.
U.S. Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could reveal how the abuse of proportion, boldly described by the victims of Larry Nassar, could have remained undetected for so long, and accepts all necessary and appropriate changes.
The U.S. gymnastics team and the U.S. Olympic Committee have the same goal - to make gymnastics as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowered environment.

>>srp_Cyrl<< In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a generally accepted theory, this also gives us details that fossils in principle cannot, such as color and a three-dimensional setting.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and pale or cartenoid on the undersides.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a strech (rachis), but have other characteristics of a feather - barbs and barbs - researchers have concluded that the strech (rachis) probably originated in later evolutionary development compared to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feather indicates that it was not used for flying, but for temperature regulation and pointing. The attitude of the researcher is that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample suggests that it is the feathers of an adult, not a cub.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The researchers stated that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult individual rather than the fluff of a chick.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A car bomb that exploded at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning has killed two police officers and injured more than twenty people.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The governor's cabinet said that nineteen police officers were among the injured.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police stated that they suspected the alleged warrior Daesh (ISIS) was responsible for the attack.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They concluded that the Sun was working on the same basic principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all stars in the system was prompted by their light and rotation and nothing else.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Shine and rotation are used together to determine Robbie's star number, which refers to the flow of plasma.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The smaller Rosby's number, the less active the star is in the domain of its magnetic reversal.

"We will make an effort to substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 2020 compared to 2005 levels," Hu said.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He did not determine the figure of that decrease, saying that the amounts would be brought on the basis of China's economic production.
Hu encouraged developing countries to “avoid the old path of pollution first and later cleanup.”
He added that "they should not, however, be asked to take on obligations that exceed their stage of development, responsibility and ability."
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Iraqi Study Group presented its report today at 12.00 pm per GMT.
He warns that it cannot be said with certainty that a certain course of action in Iraq at this moment will end the war between factions, increasing violence or increasing chaos.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The report begins with an appeal for open debate and the creation of a consensus in the United States on policy toward the Middle East.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The report highly criticizes almost all aspects of the executive's current policy towards Iraq and urges an urgent change of direction.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The first of his 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be launched before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders from hostile interventions and to re-establish diplomatic relations with neighbours.

>>srp_Cyrl<< The work done is mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written so that it simulates the observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The effect that the team was searching for would be driven by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
>>srp_Cyrl<< By the same principle by which the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides and low tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scientists have come to the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter just as ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of halos, and is made up of a multitude of tiny particles.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Doctor Moll thinks some patients may have contracted the disease in the hospital, and at least two were hospital health workers.
Within one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low - 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people who are infected at any given time in South Africa.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Police stated that the body was probably there one day.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The first cases of illness this season were reported at the end of July.
The disease is present in pigs, and then it is transmitted to humans through mosquitoes.

The diameters of all entrances to the cave, called the "Seven Sisters", range from at least 100 to 250 meters (328 to 820 feet).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Infrared images showing differences in temperature day and night indicate that these are most likely caves.
During the day they are cooler than the adjacent surface, while at night they are warmer.
“Their thermal behavior is not as constant as in the large caves on Earth, which often retain a fairly constant temperature, but it’s clear that this is because these are deep holes in the soil,” said Glenn Cushing of the U.S. Geological and Astrogeological Survey team at the University of Northern Arizona, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In France, voting is traditionally very simple in terms of technology: voters sequester themselves in the booth and place a printed ballot with the selected candidate marked in the envelope.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When official persons confirm the voter's identity, he inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs himself into the voter list.
French electoral law strictly codifies the protocol.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and no envelopes are added other than those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

>>srp_Cyrl<< Singer Sanju Sharma started the evening, followed by Jai Shankar Chaudari who sang badjan Chhapppan bhog. Singer Raju Kandelwal followed him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was then that Lakha Singh took the lead in singing the Bajana.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One hundred and eight plates of Chapan God (in Hinduism, that is fifty-six different edible foods, such as sweets, fruits, nuts, dishes and the rest offered to the deity) were served to Baba Shayam.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lakha Sinh also presented the chappan god bajan. It was also followed by the singer Raju Xandelwal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Nintendo President, Satoru Iwata, at the main presentation of the Tokyo Gamer Convention on Thursday, presented the design of the joystick for the new Nintendo Revolution console.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A-like remote control for the TV, this controller uses two sensors located next to the user's TV to triangulate its position in a three-dimensional space.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This will allow players to control actions and movements in video games by moving the device in the air.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Giancarlo Physicella lost control of the car and finished the race shortly after the start.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His clubmate Fernando Alonso was first during most of the race, but finished it just after the pit-stop, and the cause was probably a badly placed right front wheel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso, due to damage incurred during the collision in numerous duels during the race.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She is very sweet and also sings beautifully, he said, according to the press conference transcript.
“I’ve always been deeply touched when we practiced this.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< About 3 minutes after launch, a camera inside the spacecraft showed how many pieces of insulation foam are separated from the fuel tank.
However, they are thought to have done no damage to the shuttle.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The head of NASA's shuttle program, N. Wayne Hale Jr., said the foam had fallen "after a time around which we would be concerned."
>>srp_Cyrl<< Five minutes after the start of the event, the wind starts; after one minute, the wind reaches 70 km/h...Then the rain starts, but so strong and so abundant that it hits the skin like a needle; then the city falls from the sky, and people panic and scream and stomp over each other.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I lost my sister and her friend, and on my way there were two disabled people in a wheelchair, people jumping over them and pushing them," said Arman Versace.
>>srp_Cyrl<< NHK also reported that the Kashiwazaki Kariva nuclear power plant in Nigata Prefecture is doing the usual.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Hokuriku Power Company said that they had not suffered any consequences from the earthquake and that reactors 1 and 2 at the Shika Nuclear Power Plant had been shut down.
>>srp_Cyrl<< About 9400 homes in the region were reported to have run out of water, while about 100 were run out of electricity.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some roads have been damaged, rail traffic in the affected regions has been cut off, and Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture remains closed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One bomb exploded in front of the Governor General's office.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Three more bombs exploded near the government buildings over a period of two hours.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to some reports, eight people were officially killed, and official reports confirm that up to 30 people were injured. The final numbers are still unknown.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Both cyanuric acid and melamine were found in pet urine samples that died after consuming contaminated pet food.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The two compounds react with each other by forming crystals that can block the work of the kidneys, said researchers from the university.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Researchers have observed that crystals form in cat urine by adding melamine and cyanuric acid.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The composition of these crystals coincides with that found in the urine of the affected animals, when compared with the help of the infrared spectroscope (FTIR).
>>srp_Cyrl<< I don't know if you realize or not, but most of the products from Central America came to this country free of customs payments.
And yet eighty percent of our goods were taxed by way of taxes in the states of Central America.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It didn't seem to make sense to me; it certainly wasn't fair.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All I tell people is to treat us the way we treat them.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a law banning the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill requires that violent video games sold in the state of California be labeled with an “18” sticker, and that their sale to a minor be fined $1,000 per offense.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Public prosecution director Kier Starmer, a royal lawyer, made a statement this morning announcing the prosecution of both Hyun and Price.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hyun resigned and will be replaced in cabinet by MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take over the position of Minister of Economy which remains vacant after Davey leaves.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hyun and Price are scheduled to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court for February 16.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Nicolas Alden, 25 and Zachary Kudebek, 21st Kudebek was in the driver's seat.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Edgar Vegilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider will need reconstructive surgery on his face.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Uka's weapon braked as it was pointed at the head of the fifth man. Schneider constantly feels pains, is blind in one eye, lacks part of his skull, and his face is reconstructed with the help of titanium.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Schneider testified via video link from the USAF (United States War Air Force) base in his homeland.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In addition to Wednesday's competition, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championship.
Her first was Slalom, where she finished her first race with “Not Finished”. 36 of 116 competitors have the same result in that race.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In her second race, the Grand Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's gray group, with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than first-class Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-placed Giongi Dani of Hungary.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Four of the sitting skiers failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the grand slalom failed to reach the race rankings.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Madja Pradesh police found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and we returned her mobile and laptop.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The defendants were named as Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Police superintendent Chanda Shekar Solanki stated that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although three people were in the house when she was hit by a car, none of them were injured.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The road on which the collision occurred was temporarily closed as emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Grey Yarmouth.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was subsequently moved to Adenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of her son.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She is in custody where she is awaiting sentencing and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised given that her picture has been published in many media.
This is a common practice in other places in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University noted: “The press seems to be walking along a dangerous line if they post pictures of suspects or something else.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Scottish Public Prosecutor's Office, in whose general jurisdiction the criminal prosecution is, told reporters that there would be no further comment at least until the indictment was brought.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to leaked information, the document will relate to the debate over the borders, for which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Other processed topics reportedly include the future position of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley ten years after the treaty was signed, while Palestinian authorities agree that this presence only exists for five years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Archers in action for supplementary pest control were to be under strict ranger supervision, given that the action was followed and its effectiveness assessed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Thanks to a partnership between NPWS and a corporation called the Association of Sport Shooters of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were hired within the Association of Sport Shooters hunting program.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to Mick Oflin, acting director for park and heritage protection at the NPWS agency, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A new election commission (CEP) of nine members took an oath under Martelli yesterday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is Martelli's fifth election commission in four years.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Last month, the presidential commission recommended CEP's previous resignation as part of a package of measures to propel the country towards new elections.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This commission was Martelli's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sometimes violent protests are caused by not holding elections, some of which have been in turn since 2011.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Approximately 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPod devices have been reported, leading to a total of six fires, but also minor burns in four people.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it was aware of 27 accidents associated with given devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called “insignificant.”
The ministry responded by calling Apple’s delay in the report “regrettable.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< The earthquake struck Marianne at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. Friday night by GMT zone).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage was reported in the country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no indication for a tsunami.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A former Filipino police officer held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed to have died.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were Filipino photographers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The photographers later took the place of the aged lady since she needed a toilet. Mendoza was shot down with a firearm.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began building a career in the field of medicine.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
>>srp_Cyrl<< While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His research showed that in the case of hormone administration, fetal maturation of the baby's lungs would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two “black boxes” on Wednesday, containing flight records.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: “Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two months. Pretty uniquely like her. Strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldast” Rannels commented: “Luna was just as weird as I was...maybe more...I love her and will miss her...I hope she’s in a better place.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign, that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia’s last monarch.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his appeals cast doubt on his fitness.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He couldn't take the drugs he needed for painkillers since they were banned from the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Comets may have been a source of water that reached Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have collided with the Earth since ancient times.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cuomo, who is 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours “political chatter and nonsense.”
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is rumored in public that he will run for president in 2016.
>>srp_Cyrl<< NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, and to save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It uses satellite technology, contrary to earlier technologies whose basis is ground radars, so that air traffic controllers can determine the more precise position of the aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transport placed on overland trains will stop at Wembley, and parking lots and “park and drive” facilities are not available above ground.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fears of lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without team fans.
A survey published Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved within just two generations, though this process is believed to take much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the domesticated cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed in all kinds of forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be processed in the form of a thin wire, which can be twisted or spun. It can be processed with a hammer or rolled in the form of sheets.
It can be made in a very thin form, as well as glued to some other metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate images in books known as "illustrated (illustrated) manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of the chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is (alkaline).
>>srp_Cyrl<< pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical studied.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons are removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mix those two dry powders together and then squeeze them into the ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange feeling and will form a kind of wrapper.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cities of Harapa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The remains of the sewer system were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were once part of public bathrooms, where men and women were in the same company together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A satellite in space receives a call and then returns it down almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to allow us much easier and faster transportation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It brought us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Finally, there are many small cats (including free pet cats) that eat far more numerous small prey like insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of an ecological niche, a special job that every cat performs and that prevents it from competing with others.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lions are the most social among cats, and live in large groups known as packs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The packs consist of one to three adult males in kinship, compared to as many as thirty females and cubs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Females are usually closely related to each other, making a large family of sisters and daughters.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Lion packs behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other large cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, a tiger can climb a tree (though not well), swim, jump long distances and pull five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The roar of a tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but is more like a sentence full of snarling, exclaimed words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and if they can birds. Almost all the animals that ocelot hunts are far less than themselves.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scientists think that ocelots follow and search for animals that will eat (the prey) by way of smell, by smelling the place on the ground they were on.
They can see very well in the dark with the help of night vision, and also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending with the environment, and then they rush to their prey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When a small group of living things (small population) are separated from the main population they come from (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return back) they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This new environment has different resources and different rivalries, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or be adapted to be a stronger rival than was needed before.
The original population has not changed a bit, and they still need the same adaptations as before.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment it looks less and less like another population,.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Plants make oxygen that people breathe in, and take the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun with photosynthesis. They also provide us with shade.
We make houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The mosaurus was the top predator of its time, and they feared nothing but other mosauruses.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of teeth on his hard palate, meaning that nothing in his path could escape.
We can't say for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish and other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He also attacked anything that would get into the water; even a huge dinosaur such as the T-rex would not be his equal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some of their own strange or unusual things to feast on, including wild boars, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called a puff.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Another difference was that while poor men and women would eat their food sitting on chairs, rich people liked to organize banquets where they would lie on their hips while eating their meals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ancient Roman rations could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple which was considered the house of that god.
>>srp_Cyrl<< People offered sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to please the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Each temple had an open courtyard in front of the temple and an internal shrine that only priests could enter.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Once, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most of the day-to-day life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Women cooked in the yard; the shops were just open stalls overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the tree was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas they say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you've seen the movie National Treasures, you might think that the treasure map is drawn on the backdrop of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that sometime at the beginning of its creation this large document on parchment (its dimension is 293–24 inches by 241–24 inches) is rolled up for storage.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Well, most likely the label was added purely as a labeling.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was led by the Vichy French, who in 1940 reconciled with the Germans and joined with them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated the south of France and headed for Germany.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work in collaboration, i.e. society.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civilis, and is associated with the Latin civis, meaning citizen and civitas meaning city or city-state, and it also somehow defines community size.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture involves the transfer of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable expansion.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, so they are often not recognized as true civilizations.
While fighting the war of independence, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Treaty of Confederation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all its legal documents.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He also had no right to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Unanimous approval from all states was necessary before members could be changed, and the states took central administration so lightly that their representatives were often absent from the session.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Italian national football team, alongside the German national football team, was the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 World Cup.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan makes up almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to in geographical terms as an "archipelag".
The beginning of Taiwan is as early as the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of this island as "Ilya formosa", or a beautiful island.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 1624, a Dutch company from the East Indies established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation of the Aboriginal practice of grain production, and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 - 1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which granted Japan sovereignty over Taiwan it ruled until 1945.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows Room.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were reconstructed to provide tourists with a better representation of how they originally looked.
>>srp_Cyrl<< By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For example, the most common photography format for motion pictures in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant size of the film at the end of the analog film era.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is still produced today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio has been inherited by image sensor formats on digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually somewhat confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The ratio of dimensions of this format is considered to be 3:2 (divided by 12 to get the simplest ratio in the form of an integer).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many common formats (say APS family formats) are equal to or nearly approximate to this scale.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The rule of a third that is often abused and often ridiculed is a simple instruction that creates dynamism, and at the same time retains the measure of order in the picture.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It states that the most striking place for the main object is at the intersection of lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
>>srp_Cyrl<< During this period of European history, over the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, supervision began to be carried out.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For thousands of years, the Christian religion linked European markets, despite differences in language and customs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< With her inexhaustible power, she influenced everyone, from king to common man.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church exist precisely for this reason.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money has led many to wonder if this principle is being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy turned out to be effective because it cut off the supply of key military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, thereby causing danger to even neutral ships.
Since the responses to this tactic were limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unrestricted undersea warfare.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the 1920s, the prevailing views of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After seeing horrors and war atrocities during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In order to take a job at the New York Edison Company, Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his boss on a previous job) intended for Thomas Edison.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different periods of time; each period of China or each family that was in power represented a special dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces. The most famous period of all was the epoch of the Three Kingdoms which lasted for sixty years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During this period, fierce warfare took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The three kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the throne in a huge palace in Si'an.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are many social and political results such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to people, not one ruler.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Also after the occupation revolution, they were open to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The same applies to the military, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues that were beyond his ordinary life. He went to think often in a cave that became known as “Hira” on Mount “Nur” (light).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cave itself, which has survived various times, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is entirely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is difficult to find it, even if someone knows it exists. After entering the cave, complete isolation occurs.
Nothing can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exist today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of a number of large pyramid buildings that pay homage to the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Keops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Keops' wives and family members.
The “along the bow” label looks like a V, and a “down the bow label” like a staple or a square that lacks the underside.
“Up” means that you should start from the top and push the bow, while “down” means that you start from the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Raising the bows usually produces a quieter sound, while lowering the bows produces a stronger and more assertive.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Feel free to pen your labels, but remember that printed bow characters are present for musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Maria Antoinette and their two young children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and four-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to retire to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789, and were forced to do so by a mob of women from the market.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They traveled back to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a mob of people screaming and shouting threats addressed to the king and queen.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The mob ordered the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At one point a member of the mob waved before the terrified queen the head of the royal guard killed in Versailles.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The wartime costs of American imperialism when conquering the Philippines were paid for by the citizens of the Philippines themselves.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to settle most of the costs and interest on securities circulating on behalf of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
Of course, the enormous profits stemming from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people represented the basic gain of American imperialism.
>>srp_Cyrl<< To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of order.
The era in which these events took place is often referred to as the Late Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The peak of the Middle Ages was preceded by the working Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages period which officially ends around 1500.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technological development itself takes a path that is beyond cultural and political influences and that in turn technology has its "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For example, one might say that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to road development.
Nevertheless, the national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mass possession of a car also leads to a higher frequency of accidents on the road, leading to the invention of new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Romanticism contained a considerable dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and culture related to that geography would appear, and they, in accordance with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
>>srp_Cyrl<< His reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 and lasted until about 1100.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned, bearing gifts, like silk and spices, that were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was at this time that the transfer of the title of the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west could be lagging some 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest inventions of the era as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons to attach clothes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Consumer agriculture is agriculture that is conducted to produce enough food only for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Consumer agriculture is a simple, often organic system, which uses conserved seed, domestic in a given ecoregion in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Historically, most farmers have engaged in self-reliant agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Subcultures can be personified due to age, ethnicity, class affiliation, location and/or gender of members.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The traits that define subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often indicate their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One of the most common methods used to show the importance of socialization is to look back at some sad cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called “brutal” or wild. Some wild children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this kind of abandonment of children occurs due to the parents refusing to accept the serious intellectual and physical shortcomings of the child.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Wild children may have experienced severe abuse in childhood or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, wild children exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like the behavior of those animals who cared for them, such as their fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, learning through a scaffolding system is one step ahead.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Metacognitive support is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides support to individuals, with the help of which they go through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Supporting can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is actually a kind of back-uper, but so is a tiny man-switch in Microsoft Office.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Virtual backers are an integral part of the software and should question, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to implement themselves.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, which range from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
>>srp_Cyrl<< No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not fostering, caring, and educational, but it does happen anyway.
We consider the foster care system a protective zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, full-time education and reliable healthcare.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Family placement of children should provide all necessities that were in short supply in the homes from which they were previously taken.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The unique characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of uses and approaches to satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important uses of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Amy and McCord (1998) have identified “personal participation” and “maintained connections” as new motivational aspects when researching audience reactions to websites.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions, facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
It is especially claimed that if you interpret microexpressions correctly, you can tell if a person is lying.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Oliver Sachs indicated in his paper the President's speech how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess honesty.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He even believes that such abilities in understanding human behavior may also have animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and unhidden.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the fund of the expressed variation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Segregation and recombination affect the constant mixing of variations between the two funds in each generation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In savanna, a primate with a human-like digestive tract hardly satisfies the needs for amino acids from the plant sources it has available.
Even if this is not done, there can be serious consequences: the growth of depression, malnutrition and eventually death.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The plant resources that are easiest to access were proteins available in leaves and legumes, but primates like us hardly digest them if they are not cooked.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In contrast, food of animal origin ( ants, termites, eggs) not only digests easily, but also provides a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, it shouldn’t surprise us if our ancestors solved their “protein problem” in about the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
>>srp_Cyrl<< This can easily be performed with a relatively quiet alarm clock that would bring you into a conscious state without waking you up completely.
If you reset the watch during sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which makes a man get up to urinate.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and tranquility.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism was based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were extended by the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Along kundalini yoga awakens kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. By visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, conflicts of systems, processes and cultures led to the two countries feuding.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is planned to last 40 years, and the fight would be real, through the conflicts of smaller countries representing the interests of larger military powers, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba as well as in many other places.
>>srp_Cyrl<< By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, these plans were outdated almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of the eastern areas of Poland in violation of the Peace Agreement in Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral, and multilateral.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Overseas shipping is by far the most effective way to move large numbers of people and large amounts of goods across the ocean.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The job of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to transport people and goods, and at the same time to prevent the enemy from transporting its people and goods.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One of the most notable, recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to transfer people and weapons across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been as capable of conquering Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easier access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by goats who were mostly children or young, similar to the more famous shepherds. These methods of herding herds are still used today.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Roads for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling wagons to achieve higher speeds and pull larger loads than on slightly bumpier roads at the time.
Railway thresholds were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually understood that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This became an established practice, but iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron. In 1767, rails made of solid iron were used for the first time.
The first known form of transport was walking. People began walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Their predecessors, the Australopithecines did not walk upright as usual.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Perfection in bipedality was found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the sachelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem, and shut them down.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is quite obvious that the world has changed much due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and problems have become greater due to the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of mankind.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away, to the John Dunlap Press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as “Danlap’s pages”.
>>srp_Cyrl<< John Nixon was the first to read this document publicly, on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6. It was read to his troops on July 9 in New York. One copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 of Dunlap's writings that are still known to exist are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original that was handwritten is not preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the handling of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in a computer jargon.
It does not have to be immediately obvious that it is internal poisoning. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open packaging of drugs or toxic chemicals for the household.
Look at the sticker to see specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Entomologists use the term beetle in a formal sense for this group of insects.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This term comes from an ancient acquaintance with bedbugs, which are insects very well adapted to parasitizing on humans.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Both bedbug-killers and common bedbugs are species that stay with their parents for a long time, are adapted to live in a litter or host's home.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in younger people and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have symptoms of MS than men.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples may decide to plan the adoption of a baby.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When adopting, biological parents waive their parental rights so that the other couple can be the parent of the child.
The main task of science is to understand the way the world works using the scientific method. This method actually governs most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only one, and the experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observing also guide scientific research.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's understanding of all scientific questions, including psychology, was respected.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many notable rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Periodic biological rhythms that are not just responses to periodic alternation of external influences have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with the period of free running rotation, even if there are no external signs.
The Hershey-Chays experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is a genetic material.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments to label phage DNA using radioactive phosphorus or phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material that is affected and whether the cells that are affected are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in bacillus cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas, and for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including wildlife and wildlife.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Field activities include for example: hunting, fishing, photographing, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem data.
>>srp_Cyrl<< An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Every morning, people leave small rural places by car to go to their workplaces, whereby they miss out on those whose workplace is right in the place they just left.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In this dynamic transportation process, they are all connected somehow and support a transport system based on private cars.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Science now indicates that this economy of high carbon consumption has moved the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has aided the evolution of man in the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints and why do they make mistakes on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction with each other.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonable consistent range; therefore, traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be presented roughly mathematically.
>>srp_Cyrl<< To better represent the flow of traffic, links between the three main features were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These relationships help to plan, design, and operate facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to venture into the air. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and partners more effectively.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most insects have this advantage that they can gather their wings along the body.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This provides them with a greater choice of different small sites to hide from predators.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The only insects today that cannot bend their wings are dragonflies and waterflowers.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some people believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite as well; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
>>srp_Cyrl<< This sounds reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and first largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its mesmic width of six miles.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the world’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids in Giza in their size and technical exceptionality of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, who by then were over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious rites.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, humans have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, copper, since they can be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily excavated with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, had a theory that everything was made up of a mixture of just one or a few of the four elements. These are earth, water, air and fire.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, plasmic, although it also theorized that they turn into new substances, to form what we see.
Alloys are actually mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are also alloys consisting of a small amount of nonmetals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. The whole matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit into a point at the end of this sentence.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stoge's pen was a good friend to a lot of people when she showed up.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Unfortunately, when new methods of writing emerged, the pen was pushed to a lower status and less used.
>>srp_Cyrl<< People are now writing messages on a computer screen without ever being anywhere near a notch.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We can only wonder what the keyboard will turn into when something newer comes along.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A fission bomb works on such a principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It's about like pushing a heavy cart up a hill.The re-tearing of the core then releases a certain energy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The bark is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is thinner under the lunar sea, and thicker under the hills.
Perhaps there are more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to come out to the surface.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Content theories are aimed at finding what drives people or what they like.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These theories indicate that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalized while maturing into adults.
>>srp_Cyrl<< These theories study what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what things from their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Two popular content theories are Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Theory of Two Factors.
In general, two forms of behavior can occur when managers start leading their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain “one of the guys” (or girls).
>>srp_Cyrl<< This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibility and calling people to account.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At the other end of the spectrum, the person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for the team's success and failure.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This behavior often times results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Virtual teams should meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Virtual team members often function as contact for their immediate physical group.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, since their teams can meet according to different time zones for which local leadership would have no understanding.
The presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of the virtual team.
“Invisible team” is the management team to which each member submits a report. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for applying concepts of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When all available resources are effectively used in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can come to the fore.
As a result, the process of organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the needs of the customer.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge shared and organizational learning.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive abilities research. Thus, the field of research is narrowed and this makes it much more accurate.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The link between brain pathology and behavior underpins scientists' claims in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This provides us with a lot of data and materials to make simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although AI draws a strong connotation to science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnoses and client questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The artificial intelligence (AI) system is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and for military purposes, as it is embedded in several home computers and software applications for video games.
Excursions are a large part of any classroom. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places that a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions. Students can watch museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or admire the beautiful art sitting in their class.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Vitual sharing experiences with excursions is also a great way to think about the experience of a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For example, every year, Bennett School students from North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is remodeled, but old versions are kept online to be able to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve writing with students. Although students often start their experience with blogs with messy grammar and spelling, audience presence generally changes that.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to make an effort to fix writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more resourceful in terms of the world around them." The need to encourage audience interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "may empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to materials from the Internet, students can define their views in the context of other people's texts, as well as present their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, and possesses a whole range of art galleries and museums depicting Canada's past and present.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Further south are Niagara Falls, while north is a haven of intact natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
>>srp_Cyrl<< All this points out Ontario even more as something that foreigners basically consider Canadian.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost entirely uninhabited wilderness.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The East African islands are found in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island and the continent itself when it comes to wildlife.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or in connection with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was largely received on the Comoros and Mayotte.
>>srp_Cyrl<< European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, since Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found his way the Cape from Europe to India.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended to all travelers to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
>>srp_Cyrl<< Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something that they would consider harassment, and it is not rare to follow them, grasping their hand, etc.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Be determined in rejecting men and don't be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's right!).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was also used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and even Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, and then abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badia, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping cities in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of ancient Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather accessories, hookahs and a whole range of trinkets, but all this is intended for tourists.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Goma is a tourist town of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 2002, Goma was destroyed in the lava of the Niragongo Volcano, which swamped most of the city's streets, especially downtown.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although Goma is quite safe, any visits outside Goma should be well examined to understand the state of the fighting still going on in North Kivu Province.
This city is also the base from which the climb to Nyiragongo Volcano starts, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle tax) to move around Goma. The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a shorter ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu is used as a metaphor for exotic, remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation places it in tourist attractions, and there is an airport in it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Due to the threat from desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the World Heritage List in 1990 at risk.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stations during the filming of "Miracles of the African World" on PBS.
This city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the state, since it has more Arabic than African flavor.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kruger National Park (NPK) is located northeast of South Africa and along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which contains different wildlife.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a major attraction of South African National Parks (JANParks).
>>srp_Cyrl<< As in all South African national parks, there are daily fees for preservation and entry into the park.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The purchase of a joker ticket should also be considered, which allows entry to certain South African parks or to all national parks of the South African Republic.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong a name and it is a place that many tourists consider the main focus.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A series of buildings comprising the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to the glittering ribbon chart that with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour becomes apparent.
To see Hong Kong in the best way, leave the island and head for the coastal area of Kaulun on the opposite side.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most of the urban part of Hong Kong Island is densely impaled on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This place was taken by the British colonizers as their own, so if you’re looking for evidence of colonial past territory, there’s a good start.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of mangroves in the world, and extends 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining powerful jungles that once covered the Gansh plain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sundarbans extends to an area of 3850 km2, one third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Buses depart from the intermediate bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and Jakar/ Bumtang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As intermediate buses are often full, it is advised to purchase the ticket a few days in advance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most of the district is served by Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Taxi sharing is a quick and comfortable way to reach nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punaka (Nu 200).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Oyapoc River Bridge is a cable car bridge.It extends on the Oyapoc River to connect the cities of Oyapoc in Brazil and Saint-Georges del Oyapoc in French Guiana.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, and the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical opening under the bridge is 15 meters in size. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it is not open to traffic until March 2017.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The bridge is planned to be fully released in September 2017, when customs checkpoints are expected to be completed on the Brazilian side.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Gurans were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters engaged in self-sustaining agriculture as well.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as Guaikuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of India", was founded in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of Spanish invaders with indigenous indigenous groups.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since the establishment of Asuncion in 1537 Paraguay has managed to retain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Canjitas.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You can also see smaller tournaments and matches here in other parts of the year.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For all tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Polo Association of Argentina (Asociacion Argentina de Polo).
>>srp_Cyrl<< The official Falklands currency is the Falkland Pound (FRF) whose value is set equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange the money at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across the street from the FIC West store.
>>srp_Cyrl<< British pounds will mostly be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although the British currency and the United States currency may be accepted; check with owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency off the island, so exchange money before leaving the island.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Montevideo is found in a subtropical climate; in the summer months temperatures over 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined provide a feeling of being much colder than the thermometer says.
There are no special “rain” and “dry” seasons: the amount of precipitation is about the same all year round.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< According to the park's management, keep at a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Regardless of their tame appearance, bison, North American and European moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In addition, know that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking foods with a strong odor, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The port was the site of a notorious naval conflict in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships, except one British cruiser, were sunk, and nearly two hundred American and German lives were lost.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the supreme chief Tupu Tamases Lealofi III.
Since Oakland expands to two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular are those in three areas:
>>srp_Cyrl<< The beaches of the North Coast (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy with safe baths, and on most of them there is a shade that makes the trees huff.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the port of Whitemath, in the wealthy suburbs of Mousen Bay and St. Heliers in central Oakland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes full, and with a rich range of shops that go down the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer “Number One” is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called “Manta”.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are many French wines that are good to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better able to handle the journey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
To Australians, coffee is a “white double espresso with milk” foreign term. Short black is “espresso”, cappuccino comes highly topped with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Warm chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but exceptional.
Throughout the year, a multitude of trips to the reef are organized, and injuries resulting from any of the above reasons on the reef are rare.
Still, take the advice of the authorities, respect all the signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The quarter jellyfish appear near the beaches and near the mouth of the rivers from October to April north of the city in 1770. They can sometimes be found outside this time frame.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are sharks, however they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim as far away from you as possible.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance makes a passenger feel comfortable to have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through them.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Travel agents usually offer arrangements that include breakfast, provided transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel arrangement.
They can also save you a reservation if you need time to consider an offer or they can obtain other documents you need for the destination you are visiting (e.g. a visa).
Any supplement or request should first be sent to a travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on the spot, and most visitors consider it a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you’ll have to come early to provide a camping spot close to the music.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Remember that although the music on the main stages may have stopped, there may be parts of the festival where music is played late into the night.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some festivals have special camping spots for families with young children.
If you cross over the North Baltic in the winter, check the location of the hut, since passing through the ice causes quite terrible sounds for those who are most affected.
Cruises around St. Petersburg include the time spent in the city. Passengers on the cruise are exempt from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money that visitors spend. Windows and watches are mostly gone, and exits are hard to find.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and to stay in the facility.
In some places alcoholic beverages are served at the expense of the house. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning a ride at great latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below zero.
>>srp_Cyrl<< On frozen and snowy roads the grip is weak and you can't drive like you're on asphalt.
>>srp_Cyrl<< During a blizzard, in very little time it may fall enough snow to get stuck.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Visibility can also limit snow falling or flying, as well as fogging or ice on vehicle windows.
>>srp_Cyrl<< On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic takes place mostly without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the experience for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to land voyages in which you can see stunning African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to slowly approach cars, so standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, so you’ll see them better with binoculars.
Walking safari (also called "walking nature", "hiking safari" or "hiking tour") consists of walking, which lasts for a couple of hours or a couple of days.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before a delay was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cancellation policies differ, but as of late March, most cancellation policies due to coronavirus do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The expected price of most tickets for the events will range from 2500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, and the price of typical entrances will be about 7,000 yen.
Ironing helps wet clothes dry. Numerous hotels allow you to rent irons and ironing boards, even if you do not have them in the room.
If the iron is not available to you, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Make sure that the fabric does not become too warm (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, frying).
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are multiple ways to purify water, with some yielding better results than certain threats.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In some areas, cooking water for one minute is enough, and in others it takes a few minutes.
Filters differ in effectiveness, and if you are worried, then you should consider buying water from reputable companies in a sealed bottle.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Passengers may encounter animals of pests they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a man by force are not usually classified as pests.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A duty-free purchase is an opportunity to purchase tax-exempt goods and excises at certain locations.
Travelers who go to high-tax countries can sometimes save quite a bit of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The road between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburg Highway, since it often passes through isolated rural neighborhoods.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared to react quickly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves dominate.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The published speed limits are noticeably lower than on previous and later stocks - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Interestingly, however, the mobile phone network is much stronger here than along many other parts of the road, e.g. in the Pennsylvania Wilds Reserve.
>>srp_Cyrl<< German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, much like that of its southern neighbour, Austria.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fruit pastry is often, with apples baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often get along especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what depending on the region is called berliner, funkuhen or krafen.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be “dry” or “wet”, depending on the amount of liquid.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In areas in the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in caries; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Given that it covers 17,000 islands from which to choose, Indonesian food is a general term that covers a large range of regional cuisines across the state.
>>srp_Cyrl<< But, if used without additional determinants, the term usually denotes food native to the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine contains a hearse array of simply spicy dishes, among which are the prevailing aromas that Javans prefer such as peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The stirrups are the supports for the rider's feet hanging on either side of the saddle.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They provide greater stability to the rider, but may pose a security problem due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse, but his leg is stuck in the uzengia, he can be dragged away if the horse continues to run. To minimize this risk, a number of preventive measures can be taken.
>>srp_Cyrl<< First of all, most riders wear riding boots, with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety obstacles that allow the leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if it is pulled by the rider at the time of falling.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Kochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemites of South America, with a number of large granite walls and cliffs.
From the highest peaks, breathtaking views are provided. Hikers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among the vast potentials of the sides of the mountain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Snow Mountain sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending down a snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity during the trip, and many enthusiasts, often known as “ski bums” plan entire vacations spent skiing in a special location.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The idea of skiing is extremely old - cave paintings depicting skiers come from as far back as 5000 BC!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Alpine skiing as a sport has existed at least since the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hiking with skiing: This activity is also often called skiing in rural areas, ski tour or ski hike.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is associated with, but usually does not include alpine-style skiing or hiking; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much tighter skis and boots.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Imagine a ski route as similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel a slightly greater distance than by hiking - but very rarely you will reach the speed of Nordic skiing without a heavy backpack on the arranged paths.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean that you have to go through a visa application and passport control multiple times.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In this respect, the Schengen zone, however, functions similarly to one state.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport check points again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you don’t have to apply specifically for visas for each of the Schengen member states, which saves time, money and avoids paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define products over 100 years old as antiques.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be shorter in places like North America compared to Europe.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Products of handmade works can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than some similar mass-produced items.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cultivation of reindeer is important for the life of the Laponians, and culture within trade is also important for many who engage in other professions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< However, even traditionally, not all Sami were largely devoted to breeding reindeer, but lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and the reindeer were mostly used for towing and carrying cargo.
Today, many Laplands are engaged in modern crafts. Tourism is a significant source of income in Lapland, an area located in the Lapland region.
Although it is common, especially outside the Roma community, the word “gypsy” is often considered offensive because it evokes negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma.
If the country you are going to visit becomes subject to travel recommendations, it is possible that this will have an impact on your health insurance or insurance in the event of a travel cancellation.
You may also want to hear advice from governments in other countries, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different scenarios from Europeans or Arabs.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The reports are only brief summaries of the political situation in one country.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplified in relation to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a generic term for any phenomenon of dangerous weather that has the potential to cause harm, serious social disruption, or lead to loss of human lives.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bad weather can happen anywhere in the world, and there are different types that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are the forms and consequences of strong weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, water spills and cyclones.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Regional and seasonal dangerous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks of bad weather in the area where they are located, as it may affect their travel plans.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Anyone who wants to travel to a state that could be called a war zone would have to undergo professional training beforehand.
If you type “hostile environment course” into your search online, you’re likely to get a local company address.
The course will usually cover in much more detail all the issues discussed here, mainly with practical experience.
The course will usually take from 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Passengers planning a sex change operation abroad must be checking to see if they are carrying valid return documents with them.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify which person is the gender (X) or documents that have been updated to match the desired name and gender, varies.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is equally different.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Checks at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the era after September 11, 2001.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Preoperative transgender people should not expect to let them go through scanners with intact privacy and dignity.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cut currents represent a return flow from waves that separate from the beach, often present at reef or similar sites.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Due to the underwater topology, the feedback stream is concentrated on several deeper parts and a fast current to deep water can be created there.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Most deaths occur due to fatigue when attempting to swim upstream, which may be infeasible.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is not harder than it normally is.
Try to aim somewhere where you won’t be caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been spotted, you might want to wait for them to rescue you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Shock at return occurs earlier than cultural shock (shorter is the honeymoon phase period), lasts longer and may be more serious.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Passengers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to adapt to their home culture again.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of your habits from the fatherland culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding towards you, knowing that travelers in the new country had to adapt.
>>srp_Cyrl<< People may not expect that travelers returning home are also in need of patience and understanding.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The show with the sounds and the light in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things here for children.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, the sound of tourists and sellers is always heard. The story of sound and light is like a book with stories.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Sphinx is set as a background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
>>srp_Cyrl<< To the South Shetland Islands which were discovered in 1819, many nations lay rights and have the most bases there, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Others include Livingston Island and Dysepschn where the flooded caldera of the still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau, and then reappear to form the 360 km chain of Mount Ellsworth, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the northern part of the Sentinel chain, there are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Vinson reaching 4892 m.
In faraway places, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone, because in order to make a phone call, you need to be outdoors and have your satellite in clear view.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This service is often used when travelling by boat, including a yacht, as well as for expeditions that have needs for remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year off is to travel and learn.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is especially popular with those graduating from school, as it allows them to take a year off before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during the year it is paused can improve the prospects for progress towards higher education in the country of origin.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There is mainly tuition to enroll in some of these educational programs.
The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands, in lakes and on coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not need a yacht.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are really large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A boat ride is a national party in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is suited to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise very unique (e.g. in the Netherlands that number is from one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of whole days, and go back and sleep on the boat during the night.
If you are going to the coast only within boat excursions, you do not need a special visa (as of 2009).
The brochures highlight Berlin in Germany within some cruises. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all backgrounds and age groups, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes about other things that there are quite a lot of people.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For some, understanding how an aircraft works, and what happens during flight, can help them overcome fear that is based on the unknown or on the inability to have control over events.
Courier companies are well paid for the quick delivery of things. Often the time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for emergency repair.
>>srp_Cyrl<< On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for some other routes or for smaller firms, it was a problem.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If they sent things via air freight transport, on some routes it is possible that it took days to pass through unloading and customs.
The only way to get through faster was to send luggage as reported. The airline regulations will not allow them to send luggage without passengers, where you enter the story.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The obvious way to fly in the first or business class is to separate a thick pile of money for that privilege (or, better yet, get the company you work for to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the usual economy ticket for business, and eleven times more for first class!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Generally speaking, there is no point even asking for discounts for business places and first-class places on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay extra in order to have the privilege of arriving somewhere fast and comfortable, so they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of a self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, it is the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as a very good traffic hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is today a modern, developed and bustling shopping center located in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-walled buildings and modern shopping malls are interspersed with traditional red tile roofs, an 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
>>srp_Cyrl<< In the church's porta are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some tombs.
It is worth taking half an hour for a walk in an intriguing village.
>>srp_Cyrl<< To the north and in the immediate vicinity is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after the splendid story of its divots was noted by Lord Byron.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Scoturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roque.
Also, in the north, visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Temple), a place known around the world for the apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please note that you are visiting the site of mass graves, as well as a place that has an almost uncountable significance to a large part of the world’s population.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are still many men and women who survived staying here, and many more of those whose loved ones were killed or were exploited to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do not destroy a place by making marks or carving graffiti on objects.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and in fact everyone knows Spanish.
