Welsh parliamentarians are worried they will "look like Muppets"
Some MPs were appalled by the proposal that they could be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
>>srp_Latn<< This came about due to plans to rename the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Parliamentarians from all political spectrums are concerned that they could become a subject of ridicule.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the name "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh twp means dumb and pwp means shit.
The parliamentary representative from the Party of Wales (Welsh Plaid Cymru) said that the group as a whole is “not satisfied” and suggested alternative solutions.
The Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to changing its name, but that the MWP in the speech could quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter “w” is pronounced similar to the pronunciation of the letter “u” in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary committee, which is currently preparing the law to introduce the name change, said: "Of course the final decision on how MPs will be titled will be on themselves."
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that met broad support for changing the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding what MPs would be called, the Committee tended to be called "members of the Welsh Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
Parliamentarians propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring headaches to Parliament Speaker Elin Jones who is expected to submit a bill on changes within weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the way parliaments work, including rules on disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, MPs will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians hold referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents the claim of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of the process of its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
>>bos_Latn<< St. Martin's bells silenced as churches in Harlem battle for survival
“The older people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past,” Mr. Adams said.
“There’s no one or the other today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People are interacting in a different way now,” he said.
“Bars no longer represent the living rooms of neighborhoods where people regularly stay.”
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think, and “earlier or later it will be found again at the beginning.”
He added that churches could replace apartment buildings with apartments where people would live who would not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore the day will come faster when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
>>srp_Latn<< A black congregation that held worship services nearby took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson at the helm who also led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who opposed hiring or improving blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but since Reverend Johnson's parishioners planned its rebuilding, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor people".
An expert who played at the carillon in July used a different name: “cultural treasure” and “an indispensable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the world's first carillon played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind who has been playing on a larger carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
>>bos_Latn<< Mr Merriweather said St. Martin did not replace him.
What takes place in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the parish's governing body made up of lay people, wrote to the diocese in July over concerns that the diocese would "seek to shift costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the side of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California
According to the official statement, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
>>bos_Latn<< The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's distress call, and then rowed with the group to the scene of the attack to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was excitement over the lobster he caught, but then realized he was shouting “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire clavicle had been torn.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of shark.
>>bos_Latn<< Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and safety of the swimmers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
>>bos_Latn<< Sainsbury‘s becomes a competition with chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing department store-style cosmetic counters and hiring specialized retailers.
As part of the large entry into the UK beauty market worth 2.8 billion GBP, which continues to grow in parallel with the decline in sales in the home clothing and equipment market, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if they prove successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets are trying to take advantage of the shelf space that was once designed for TVs, microwaves and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its range of cosmetics to 3,000 products, including first-time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique decorative cosmetics, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test-use the concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
>>srp_Latn<< Network shopping and returning to the daily shopping of small amounts of food in local grocery stores means supermarkets must try harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlet would look more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain strives to resist low-cost stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced outlets to hundreds of Argos stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because it bought both chains two years ago, which it claims encouraged the sale of foodstuffs and made these acquisitions more profitable.
>>bos_Latn<< The supermarket's previous attempt to refresh its departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products was not successful.
Sainsbury’s entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but this ended in an argument over the distribution of pharmacy revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical business for 125 million GBP three years ago at 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
He claims Lloyds will play a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skincare products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide our customers with a more comfortable environment.
We have also invested in special training of colleagues who will be at hand to customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for the purchase of cosmetic products, which will lead to the change of old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby quits 11-million-pound deal
Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones left to “cook with fury” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby gave up an 11 million pound contract with his brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for their brand of home clothes and fashion accessories Truly.
Their brand has been compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the star of the show Dragon’s Den of Peter Jones to cook with anger by withdrawing from the joint profitable business at the last minute to focus on her own new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim Jones was “angry” when a golden girl on television during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homewear and fashion accessories brand, Truly.
This business was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and was to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at ?11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of her vacation homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It was meant to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to retire stunned everyone involved in the deal.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to starting the whole line.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a lot of merchandise that's ready to sell."
Experts believe that due to the departure of show host This Morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and the possible additional delay in starting the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as CEO in March.
The couples spend vacations together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I’m a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Tough negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in newspapers because of comments that some might consider “unworthy of the president” and because he has such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make so many concessions?”
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
“I didn’t make any concessions.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks are stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not noticed a “appropriate reaction” from the United States to North Korea’s disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the US has still not lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech at the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would get hurt.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: suspending test launches of missiles, assisting in the release of hostages and bringing the remaining US troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people waiting in front of this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people there,” Trump said.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
>>bos_Latn<< Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international help, so it's all a bit problematic," Ms Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children organization is assembling a team to travel to Pale, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to engage in relief efforts.
Given the constant tremors in Indonesia, the country remains woefully unprepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not something that is common on other parts of the coastal line.
>>bos_Latn<< The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And in the best time travel between numerous Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship that was moored in Lombok to take care of the earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's decayed structure was the foundation of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Yoko is struggling with a lack of funding, and new elections are held next year.
Yoko also faces pressure from remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battle in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in a Premier League match against Chelsea by a shot in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 yards from a Chelsea goal at a 1-0 score for Chelsea.
He switched the ball to his left foot before kicking it towards the opposite goalpost.
>>bos_Latn<< The ball took off high above the goal towards the right upper corner of the net.
>>bos_Latn<< The ball eventually escaped Kepai Arrizabalagai who jumped towards it and entered the net.
“It was difficult to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn’t think about it too much and I just shot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after hitting Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blue striker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovačić during that game before turning somewhere in half of the field and running into Liverpool's half.
>>bos_Latn<< Kovacic made a quick pass in the middle of the field.
He then directed a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the ball into the net with his left foot on the opposite goalpost next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton to the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster office said early on Sunday.
A spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho news agency said at a press conference that it was reported that a large number of people were trapped in the rubble of buildings after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that was felt on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after the woman was fatally stabbed.
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 07:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and the 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still in the beginning, but I would like to hear from everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a Birkenhead resident and was found inside the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the scene who believe they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have stated that the process of notifying the victim's next of kin is also underway.
The cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the officers told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take several hours until they can return to their apartments.
>>bos_Latn<< The officer reportedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
>>bos_Latn<< The woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He kept saying, “That’s so bad.”
At 14:00, there were two police vans in the fenced area, and another was parked just outside.
A large number of police officers stood within the fenced area and supervised the apartment block.
Anyone with any information has been asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, citing the record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell’s statue in Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the midst of a debate on “the redrawing of history”
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near-Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts executed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr Crick's attempt "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate that is currently being debated over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become the subject of debate.
>>bos_Latn<< The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars is not something Cromwell ordered nor enforced.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The wonderful revival of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the way of thinking of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a person who many still consider to be worthy of honour.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament from outside pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely credible opinion is a subject of historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is the single recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of Lord Protector continue to be worthy of homage and commemoration."
The killer killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
A man with the name "Yuan" was found dead of severed arteries and covered in blood near a stable in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou province, South China's Morning News reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pigsty on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door to the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that a 250-pound pig bit the breeder to death.
According to the Guiyang Evening News, a relative named “Wu” stated: “My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated.”
>>bos_Latn<< Footage from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Večernje Novosti that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market administration are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, attacks by pigs on humans have already been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and the husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer against a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They're nibbling, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's Remains Bring Heavy Rains to Southwestern U.S.
As announced, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
>>bos_Latn<< Rosa blew at 140 km/h at 05:00 Eastern Time, making her a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is forming over the Pacific and moving towards the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push back a deep layer of tropical moisture in a north-southwesterly direction.
>>bos_Latn<< Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching low pressure area will cause heavy rainfall to occur in much of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous torrential flooding, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause rainfall to be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts in the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Flooding is possible with rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not advised to go to the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local stormy winds and dusty wind.
Approaching low pressure areas will bring local heavy rains to parts of the southern California coast.
Rainfall is possible in an amount greater than 12 mm, which can cause less mud torrents and slippery roads.
This will be the first wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning before covering a wider area at the end of the day on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the border areas of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah on Tuesday and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes are possible across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at small distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the residual summer heat will continue to rise and expand again.
In most of the central and eastern United States, the beginning of October is expected to be warm from 27 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched the tense testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, a political showdown continued, and reporters interrupted the regular program to notify the last-minute turnaround that Friday: a deal reached by Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was completely sure Kavanaugh was groping her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in fervent testimony that he was completely certain that this did not happen.
The hearing on Friday was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, a number cited in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
>>bos_Latn<< No number of viewers were immediately available for other networks that carried the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually also has difficulty measuring the number of people looking at content in offices.
To better illustrate this, it is an audience that is similar in number to the one watching the American football playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The profession remained large even after the hearing.
>>bos_Latn<< Flake had a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning filmed protesters shouting at him while he was trying to take the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
For a few minutes, he stood with his eyes down while protesters showered him with insults on live CNN cameras.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to this country?”
They said to him, “You have power while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement even before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the committee hearing.
Hours later, all cable and television networks were monitoring live when the Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote on sending Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote throughout the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate over the next week, as demanded by Democrats who are in the minority.
Flake was partially persuaded by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talks with Coons, and then several other senators, Flake made the decision.
>>bos_Latn<< Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 for a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in another interview in the same issue with her on the front page went on to criticize her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other customs duties is "total nonsense".
Murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected of LSU player's death
Police have arrested suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and detained on charges of manslaughter, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
A bail of US$350,000 was requested.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department thanks the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police, and the citizens of the area for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for their “perseverance and search for the truth.”
Sims was 20.
>>srp_Latn<< The 183 cm high winger grew up in Baton Rouge in which his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "in shock" at Wayde's death.
“That’s what we’re always worried about,” Wade said.
Volcanoes throwing ash at Mexico City
The ash ejected by the Popocatapetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
>>srp_Latn<< The center followed multiple rumblings and tremors.
>>bos_Latn<< Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists note the increased activity of the volcano, which has been located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalan separatists and police clash over independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters advocating independence clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined anti-demonstrations to mark a Catalan polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists who were prevented by riot police began throwing eggs and powder paint at police officers, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
Fighting also broke out later in the day when police used batons to calm the brawl.
Over the course of several hours, independence groups chanted “No forgetting, no forgiveness,” and the Unionists chanted “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were admitted to hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstration, the local press reported.
Tensions in the independence-minded region have not subsided even a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal and which Catalans celebrate.
The overwhelming majority of voters opted for independence even though the turnout was small because those who were against secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in fierce clashes last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent the night on the street on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
>>bos_Latn<< The demonstrations took place, but the protesters were forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended demonstrations by separatists along with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite winning a key, albeit narrow victory in last December's regional elections, Catalonia's pro-independence parties are finding it difficult to maintain momentum this year as their most famous leaders are in self-imposed exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed demonstrations on his phone in support of police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has announced that he will run for European Parliament elections next year.
“Candidating for the European elections is the best way to announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after crashing into a house in Londonderry.
>>bos_Latn<< The incident occurred on Thursday at around 7.30pm BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Superintendent Bob Blemmings said the yard door and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point an arrow was fired at the car from a crossbow.
Menge's goal brought Livingston a 1–0 victory over Rangers.
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston brought victory
The new Scottish Premier League club Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to concede his only second eighteen-game defeat at the head of the club from Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Menge's shot proved decisive as Gary Holt's team aligned with the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team remains unbeaten in the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they play Hearts, the league's leading club behind eight points.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna club as part of the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not suffered a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's team should have led even before they scored, given that their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but was too slow on the way to goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after slipping to intercept a headbutt by Craig Halkett towards goal.
>>bos_Latn<< The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause difficulty for the guests
This is how the key goal was scored.
The Rangers missed to stop the free kick, and Livingston masterminded the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisting Mengi together to score in the middle of the goal.
By this point, the Rangers mostly had control of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no business for the most part.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the kick.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor's legs got in the way of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow took a wide kick from another organized Livingston attack.
Long passes failed to cross the Livingston goal line, and no two penalty kicks were awarded - after Halkett's clash with substitute player Glen Middleton and one for hand play.
"Great" by Livingstone - analysis
Alasdar Lamont of the Scottish BBC at the Tony Macaroni Arena
>>bos_Latn<< Excellent play and result by Livingston.
All of them were excellent, which continued to exceed expectations on that input path.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since their return to the big clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he has united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at leading an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to take a break throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
>>bos_Latn<< They were far from the standards they set for good play under Gerrard.
They didn't manage to get the ball all the way through. They only opened the hole in the home team once and it's kind of a call to snap up for the Rangers who are in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) everything was full of smiles under the clear sky when the leader of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They differed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police blocked a crowd of 25,000 outside the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of the president's supporters showed up to see him.
And hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters -- a large number of them Kurds -- have raised their voices by condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him home.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the divisiveness caused by a visitor who is hailed by some German Turks as a hero, while others attack as an autocrat.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist killed in car crash
The cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the junction of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a road with dense traffic in Deptford to the southeast of the city at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place several months after the death of another cyclist after the crash and the driver's escape from a crash on Chiders Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash site.
City police said police officers were trying to identify the man and inform his next of kin.
Roads were closed due to the accident and bus traffic was diverted, and motor vehicle drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 Police Officers Injured in Riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in the unrest in a male prison of the imprisoned type.
>>bos_Latn<< Riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special Tornado units have been brought in to contain the unrest involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers were provided with assistance on the spot due to minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been hired to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
>>bos_Latn<< Six staff members received assistance due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and that they could spend a long time behind bars."
The Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the prison warden had ended up in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to prison to resolve a serious situation in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with torrential flooding (possible benefit for arid areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but there’s a chance that it will happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa makes its way across the Desert Southwest with residual power and brings about the threat of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the area from western Arizona, through southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
>>bos_Latn<< Rosa is scheduled to approach Phoenix late Monday with rain and cross straight over it on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought about a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles [320 km] of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm at the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest including the Rockies and the Great Basin there is a probability of precipitation of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total amounts of up to 100 mm.
For those out of danger from torrential flooding, Rosa could come as a rescue because the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a major danger, some of these rains could be useful because there is currently a drought in the southwest.
“According to the U.S. map of arid areas, little more than 40 percent of Arizona is affected by at least the extreme drought, the second highest category,” Weather.com said in a statement.
The hurricane's trajectory first approached the coast along Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had hurricane strength with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and was moving northwards at 20 km per hour.
The storm encountered the colder waters of the Pacific and therefore weakened.
>>bos_Latn<< Therefore, it is expected to approach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
Rain in parts of Mexico could be severe and pose a significant threat of flooding.
“The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora is from 75 to 150 mm, a possible maximum of 250 mm,” Weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass across Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rain in the Baja California Peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the American Desert Southwest,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening torrential floods and torrential mud in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
Around 04.00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, an injured teenager was found.
He was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.
The Avon and Somerset Police Department said the 17-year-old, 2 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officials have called for anyone with a video of the incident to come forward.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Suffered From Democratic Party Harassment
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at an election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered malice and anger” from the Democratic side during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and firmly and emotionally denied accusations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford dozens of years ago when they were teenagers.
>>bos_Latn<< Christine Ford also testified at the hearing on the charge she made.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with a flawless career in public service,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of getting Republicans to the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I am," he said.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump said the Democratic mission was to “create resistance and obstruction.”
A Republican aide told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, a large number of which were dragged away by huge waves hitting the coast when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six meters high hit the shore, dragging many of them to their deaths and crashing everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately and were killed," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses with it, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived,” he said.
>>bos_Latn<< Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, crooked and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent strikes continued to shake that coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake matched the two-fold force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
>>bos_Latn<< It states that the geographical position of the city located at the end of a long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been demolished.
He also said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damage may be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala that is closer to the quake's epicenter.
“Communications have been completely cut off and we have no information from Donggal.”
"More than 300,000 people live in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a slew of criticism for failing to provide information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials claim the waves came as the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building panickingly warning people down on the street about an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed ashore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused communications around Palu to cease, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other necessary supplies.
The city's airport has been reopened for humanitarian activities only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although the staff of World Vision from Donggala successfully arrived in the city of Palu where employees were put away in tarpaulin tents set up in the yard of their office, they forwarded the scenes of destruction on the way," Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched aid wheels in the disaster, some have complained that foreign aid workers with great expertise have been prevented from coming to Pale.
Under Indonesian regulations, financing, supplying and hiring personnel from other countries can only begin if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster’ we can receive international aid, but such a situation has not yet been declared.”
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Pale on Friday, friends and families of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigated black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewers.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
>>bos_Latn<< Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's state paraglider team trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
>>srp_Latn<< Some among those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his students.
“Given my many years in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel that had spread to the paraglider community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to the Palu contestants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a grey checkbox, instead of two blue checkboxes.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during cash machine charge at Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was charging an ATM at the Newport on the Levee Center on Friday morning, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the car was emptying the ATM at the amusement complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with it, another man “came running behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money that needed to be put in an ATM.
Witnesses noticed more suspicious people fleeing the scene of the theft, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
>>bos_Latn<< Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday announcing the change, he wrote: "The living will be officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live in which he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
The show's authors said it replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who cancelled due to "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West has previously stated that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year in a conversation about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“I’m you, I’m me, I’m me.
It started with Kanya, which means “the only one”, in Ye itself it is a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
>>bos_Latn<< He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
>>srp_Latn<< Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And a former West associate, JAY-Z, toyed with versions of his name without a hyphen and with a hyphen and in capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against citizens
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against citizens as the country nears the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that he would "never use an army against the Mexican people."
Military troops fired during peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as left-wing student movements began to spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening a number of free public universities.
>>bos_Latn<< He said unemployment and lack of education opportunities attract youth to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI).
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it invests in research in the field,” said Kai Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence investor and expert in the field, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment came after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans regarding artificial intelligence although the U.S. in principle lacks a formal strategy regarding artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
“A double increase in the budget for AI research would be a good start as all other countries fall far behind the U.S. and are looking for the next major breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
“A double increase in investment could double the chances of the next major AI breakthrough in the United States,” Lee told CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player in the game Othello, and later served as director of Microsoft's research department and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
“It’s not China that is taking away academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on AI research over recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
The China State Council published the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to individuals in academic institutions much like the National Science Foundation and other state organizations provide funding to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of an AI committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than US$100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that wanted to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Saturday on whether they want to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia". It is a move that could resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has caused Greece to block the opening of accession talks to the European Union and NATO.
There is a province in Greece called Macedonia and Greece claims that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on a proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the deal with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to enable Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgievska, 79, said in Skopje.
>>bos_Latn<< While the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect it to be considered decisive.
>>bos_Latn<< The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, joined a referendum in Strumica on 30 September 2018 on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and took the chairs in front of the tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us under the name Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will support the referendum, since more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said a “positive” result would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will join the referendum, below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Thelma TV, showed that 57% of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
For a referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western government since it took office last May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton defence to score a goal
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, and took a 2-0 victory for Manchester City.
Aguero made the win insanely simple, scoring in the 65th minute.
>>bos_Latn<< The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton defence players and then made it onto the open field.
>>srp_Latn<< Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposing players in greenshirts.
>>bos_Latn<< He bypassed one defender and then overtook several others at the edge of Brighton's space.
He then passed the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguer on the first try, who threw the right-hand picket ball into the right-hand side of the net and defeated Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an initial lead in the Premier League clash.
That shot was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's court during that game.
He passed the ball beautifully to Leroy Sane along the left flank.
Sane pushed the ball several times before leading Sterling towards the goalpost.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net just before he slid into the car.
Manchester City are battling Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Germany's Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to stop the Rockies from advancing
Since Nationals players were eliminated from the playoffs, there was not too much reason to insist on a new start.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to win Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, make the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a place in the wild-card playoffs with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to win their first title.
“While we play for nothing, we can at least pitch knowing the atmosphere here in Denver with a crowd of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would witness this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a Sunday starter, but are reportedly inclined to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitching area on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The right-handed player from Washington made a score of 18-7 this season, an ERA average of 2.53 runs and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds innings.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During a speech on the importance of Republican voter turnout in the general election, the president was always commenting on his selection of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge.
“Everything we’ve done will be tested in November.
There are still five weeks left until one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones - I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race and that's why I'm everywhere, to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
Their intention is to take power again in any way; you see wickedness, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to step over to take power and control; that's why they want power and control. We won't give them."
Democrats, he says, have a mission to “resist and interfere.”
“You’ve seen that over the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, evil, corrupt and lying.”
He addressed Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, prompting loud public outrage.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
>>bos_Latn<< No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document - it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer taking a different view.
He does not tolerate personal opinions.
I was not too surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to be told they are not welcome - all because we have said what is on our minds.
According to my associate, Joan Ryan behaved similarly because she strongly opposed antisemitism.
I was criticized in the censorship proposal for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party's branch meeting on Friday said that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have worked as a local Labour Party MP, Friday night meetings of the main council were just like that.
Unfortunately, nowadays a lot of meetings go in a different tone, and the promise of a “more kind, gentle” policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as collaborators who I thought shared similar political opinions began to demand from me a drastic change of opinion and taking positions that I would never otherwise agree with - be it national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak to the public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there is a stream of insulting words on social media calling for my impeachment, denouncing the policies of the centre and telling me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I have had better luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that have been addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments every day, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that has most disappointed me is tolerating abusive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with each proposal of distrust or change of election rules we become an increasingly narrow-minded party.
Many times in the last two years I have been advised to keep my head down, not to be so loud and told that everything would be fine then."
But that’s not why I entered politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by Margaret Thatcher’s neglect of the government that has left my school’s multi-purpose classroom to decay, I have wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or minister in government.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East branch could be misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who backed the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is grasping at Brexit that will have a negative impact on households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But actually the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituencies, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political gain will deter me from acting as I see fit in your best interests.

Ayr - Melrose: 38-17 undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat influenced the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day in Tennent's Premiership league.
They have now reached the top of the rankings and are the only undefeated of the ten teams.
Ultimately, top defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be pleased.
“We’ve been tested at every game so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said, "Well done to Ayro, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute realized by Frazier Climo led Ayr into the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was ruled out of the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose the opportunity to lift the score, and Jason Baggot took an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by an eleven before scoring at half time and making a solo try to change the score for Ayr to 17: 5 ahead of the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, realized by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a long pause due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott who was taken away on a stretcher, and when the game resumed, Ayr continued the good game with a try by Stafford McDowall realized by Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again forced the extra player to pay, with an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The lateral player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to knock down Clima who did not have the ball; from the penalty kick line, MacPherson performed a touchdown behind Ayr in the full sweep of the penetration.
Climo realized, as he had done so almost from the start again, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry to the fifth try of the home team.
The star of Still Game seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in the service industries after it was revealed that he has been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favorite series and is one of the stars, along with long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to be shown, and Kienan seems to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to become involved in a "growing restaurant business in Glasgow".
Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will grant it access to the Pacific Ocean.
Sailors patrol a marine center packed with cranes in La Paz.
On public buildings, a flag of the color of the ocean was hung.
The maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have a motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It’s our duty to bring him back.”
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the lost seashore in favor of Chile during the conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive - just like the longing for refloating the Pacific Ocean.
With Bolivia awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice expected on Oct. 1, following a five-year trial, these hopes may be at their highest level in decades.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistic about the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A host of Bolivians across the country will watch the ruling by the International Court of Justice on big screens and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's view that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate to cede a sovereign outlet to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, a Bolivian charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's ruling.
“We are close to returning the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia's favor and that little would change if it did.
The Dutch-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final hearings, meaning the case “wasn’t complex,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have set them back.
"The issue of access to the sea has been claimed by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has buried all good will in Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will resume dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
>>bos_Latn<< Former President Eduardo Rodræguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with each other," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's favorite presidents - used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen if it can't trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never disarm if they could not trust Washington.
>>bos_Latn<< Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises during a meeting of the leaders of the two rival countries in Singapore.
The comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of “lack of imagination” and that U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War will by no means bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to back the declaration without first taking concrete steps to disarm it.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s serious intention to give up the arsenal it probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the last line of large headgear is on the way to a luxury store in your neighborhood
If you want to improve your hat collection or completely shelter the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a line of wacky huge headgear for their spring and summer 2019 collection and delighted fans of the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats swept Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their creations that attract attention to the runway.
Valentino designed the specimen, a large beige hat decorated with a wide plumage that completely “took over” the heads of the model.
Other bulky accessories included jewelry-decorated watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but those accessories were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion pieces.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a snorkel and a mask, and the other looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
If you follow the big fashion statement, happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge hats could come in luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The huge hats fit perfectly with the “La Bomba” heels, a straw hat with a brim approximately 60 cm wide that has been seen on many celebrities, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the extremely impractical hat that subdued social media sent another great creation to the catwalk - a straw beach bag nearly as big as the model in the bathing suit that wore it.
The dimly orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia tassels and a white leather handle, was an exhibition copy in Jacquemus' La Riviera's 2019 summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous and famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores for next summer. Since the designer made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for big fashion accessories.”
John Edward: the language skills that the citizens of the world need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued into 2018 with another suite of outstanding exam results, and the added weight is given by individual and joint successes in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want, and make them citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement the aforementioned school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be the preferred and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in your mother tongue, it goes to his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the highest scores in the languages were achieved by the participants of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils received an excellent Mandarin language score, while 72% of pupils learning German, 69% of pupils learning French and 63% of pupils learning Spanish also received the highest possible score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as electives are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as in other places.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17% of employers could not fill jobs due to a lack of language skills workforce.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming an imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As language skills are sought in more and more jobs, these skills are key in a globalised world.
Regardless of career choices, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such a long-term skill.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with strangers, and this gives them an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75% of respondents in the UK do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of respondents, or 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today's children.
If children learn more languages, especially in developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
>>bos_Latn<< In Scotland each school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their program, while others will opt for languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, in independent schools they will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are expert in the field.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment where they can prepare and equip themselves with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
One cannot ignore the fact that today’s global business is very important for the future of every country, so it must also be reflected in education.
Thus, knowledge of modern languages should indeed be seen as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer language selection, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
>>srp_Latn<< Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will play in the Lakers jersey for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes they will play.
“More than one and less than 48 minutes,” Walton told the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was unlikely to play the entire game.
After training early this week, James answered questions about his plans for a six-game preseason at the Lakers.
"At this stage of my career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign with numerous rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned rallies that Trump will hold next week, including brief visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has yet to cast his vote for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming election as Republicans risk losing their majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does tonight’s Trump rally start in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which sparked controversy over sexual abuse allegations. The Senate's affirmative decision has been pending for a week until the FBI investigation is completed.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain the upper hand for the November election.
Therefore, Trump’s campaign staff said the five rallies scheduled for next week aim to “stimulate volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“The majority in Congress is so important to the president’s plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as we embark on a tumultuous campaign,” a spokesman for the Trump campaign told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month on Saturday, winning by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to help him improve his ranking in the polls,” said Simon Haedar, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team left heart on the field before individual skirmishes on Sunday
>>bos_Latn<< After three one-off sessions the pair's Sunday afternoon skirmish may have been just what was supposed to reverse the Ryder Cup.
“The Wheel of Fortune Turns” is a saying that is especially true in sports and that athletes believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
To whom is the wheel of fortune now favored?
“They had a six point lead and now they have four. So I think happiness is on our side right now,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europeans are ahead by four points, with 12 points remaining by the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got some wind in the back and encouragement from his game paired with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after a day's play.
>>bos_Latn<< Spieth played murderously from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
Fan celebratory shouts grew louder as Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, all culminating in the key route by which Spieth reached the tie.
The way he won the 15-hole game was followed by a similar cheering roar in which one can recognize the hope and faith that Americans can turn everything around.
“You just need to concentrate and think about your game,” Spieth said.
These players are all that is left.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
>>bos_Latn<< The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a Ryder Cup sensation.
Europe's strange but irresistible couple has the maximum number of points and can't go wrong.
“Moliwood” is the only couple that didn’t lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but he also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinari, show that they are the very players to beat on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two who can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over Paris’ Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took down Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's game of the couple.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes in the playing field buried the Spaniard and the Swede in the hole from which they failed to dig out.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help individuals dig themselves out of their hole.
>>bos_Latn<< It is fascinating to watch pairs games up close because you can see the interactions of players in a pair, hear the tips they give and the ones they don't, as well as study a strategy that can change in an instant.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the U.S. team has the necessary combativity, which some, especially the Statesides, suspected.
Europeans enter Ryder Cup on last day with a lead of 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday's doubles games on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant advantage over the United States of 10 : 6.
Dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led by four points difference at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team in an effort to win the trophy that eluded her in Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the American team in the morning games in doubles by a score of 3 to 1.
The U.S. team showed greater fighting in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already great.
To win the trophy, Jim Furyk's team is to collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", are only the second pair to score four points in a game in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
>>bos_Latn<< After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, they proved to be outscored in the game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau by a 5&4 win.
Woods who did not show the best performance in two Saturday games made some ingenious moves, but now has 19 losses of 29 games in fourballs and doubles and seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to return to the game with partner Henrik Stenson and suffered a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's first and third best player.
But not everything was going well for the Europeans on a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Sunday, setting the bar high for their U.S. team.
They first defeated Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter by a score of 2&1 in fourballs, and subsequently defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy by 4&3 in doubles after losing the first two holes.
Twice in Ryder Cup history a team that was four points behind managed to return in individual games, though Fury's team only needs a scoreless draw to retain the trophy.
After two days in arrears, Sunday's counterattack seems to be hard for them.
North Korea says it has 'no chance' of unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions would increase distrust of the United States and that there was no way that North Korea would unilaterally disarm and abandon nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the U.N. General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill,” for example halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test station, and making a decision to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory reaction from the United States," he added.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we don’t have faith in our national security either. Under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization that would gradually lift sanctions on North Korea, his statement is significant because he has not rejected unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current U.S. president and leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim made a promise to work to “denuclearize the Korean peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea wants to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has conditioned Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons before then.
Washington has also ignored calls to reduce strict international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on denuclearization and increasing pressure by means of sanctions in order to forcibly achieve its goal, and even opposes the “declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a misconception of people who don’t know anything about us.
>>bos_Latn<< The main problem is that continuing sanctions increases distrust."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US president spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But the minister said Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held as many as three meetings in the past five months, adding: “If denuclearization had been sought by South Korea and not by the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech differed greatly from that of last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after President Trump called Kim a “man rocket” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday there was no timeframe for denuclearization, adding: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Implementation of Security Council sanctions must be strictly continued until full, definitive and verifiable denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in a bid to halt funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio at the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him out after hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea agreed to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He added that Kim had revealed to him that these “appropriate measures” were related to the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and certain steps toward stabilizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to learn how to get a good rest
A new course at Harvard University allowed all students to get a good night’s sleep in an attempt to combat an increasingly widespread culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic has found that students at the world's best university often have no idea about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, devised a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea of the course after giving a speech about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, “Why did I learn this only now, in my last year of college?”
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help with academic and sports success and generally improve health.
A professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the Paul Barreira University Health Service says the university has decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed in students during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks involves an image of a dormitory where students have to click cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers, and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how sleep deprivation affects success, and how important sleep routines are.
During the lecture, students learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus map with interactive icons is displayed that encourages students to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health," added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in all-night learning before the exam still exists, says the professor, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps to fight weight gain because lack of sleep affects the brain, inserts it into a state of starvation and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending his lectures in his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar study course before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking. They must be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by the screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston Rangers 1 : 0: Meng's goal defeats Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menga's shot hit Steven Gerrard's flawed defense and ended the game with Livingston winning with a score of 1 : 0.
The Ibrox team wanted to make their first away win after a 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games, so his team is now behind eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time, and the Rangers seemed to run out of inspiration and did not seem to tie the score.
As the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston rose to third with just one touchdown difference behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for Rangers after line umpire Calum Spence suffered a head injury when some object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the flanks and thus fumbled past Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingston lineup that the Hearts took a measure of last week and would have been delighted with how his well-designed lineup smothered any opponent's attempt.
The Rangers may have had the ball more in possession, but Livingston scored more with it.
They had a chance to score as early as two minutes after Menga was first knocked out of the game which opened up space for Scott Pittman to head for Allan McGregor's goal, however, the midfielder missed that opportunity.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only forward an imprecise blow to the rear ranks.
Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the referee should have awarded him a penalty in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not comply with the Colombian's request.
In the first half, the Rangers managed to direct only two balls towards the goal, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly's one head-butt Lassane Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria's tame kick were not a big problem.
Although Livingston's 34-minute play-off has slowed the game, no one can deny them the effort.
The Rangers again failed to take advantage of deep Jacobs' returned ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his composure and selected Menga for an easy completion of the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had an immediate effect as the winger added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett took one long shot at the other.
Holt's side could extend the lead in the closing moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide sweep from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton once again asked for a penalty late because he tripped with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye this time as well.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now here's a page from our Almanac in the show "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...the day of the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
The mainstay of science from that time, the Geiger counter became the mainstay of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Colorado, starring the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What on earth is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, and it’s used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
>>bos_Latn<< When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Look at that, you can hear it!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” bad cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” bad cells and destroy them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The procedure involves the extraction of cells of the immune system from the patient and their alteration in the laboratory
The cells are treated to be able to “recognize” the protein that is common to many types of cancer and are then re-injected into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has retreated for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting the cells of the immune system from the patient, changing them in the laboratory to know how to “recognize” a protein called HER2 that is common to many types of cancer and re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from the patient and “learning” how to recognize cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West became involved in discussions about Trump after his appearance on Saturday Night Live and backed him up, wearing a cap that read "Make America Great Again."
It didn't go well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a break-up performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song on a night called Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap that read “Make America Great Again,” he went on to speak out against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people so often and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
>>bos_Latn<< Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual abuse claims.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's speech was transmitted to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether the announcement of Rock was trying to mock West.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had been reproached backstage for the hat he was wearing.
“I was thrown backstage.
They told me, “Don’t go anywhere with that hat on.”
I've been harassed!
>>bos_Latn<< They said I sank," the Washington Examiner quoted him as saying.
West continued, “You want to see the bottom?”, and said he would wear his Superman cape because it meant I couldn’t tell him what to do.
Try it with love.”
Variety magazine said its comments had caused at least two public outcry, with members of Saturday Night Live appearing embarrassed, with one person saying to the magazine: “The whole studio has gone silent.”
West was called up at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had passed away a few days earlier.
West's performance of "I love it", dressed as a bottle of mineral water Perrier, stunned many.
West was supported by Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the people with the bravest spirit: THANK YOU FOR standing up to the mob.”
But show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West had simply “been himself and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
>>bos_Latn<< So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "going to be officially known as Kanye West".
>>bos_Latn<< He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's footsteps, which is also known under the names Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed her name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder with a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder of a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police reported that the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington takes aim at toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow wielding a sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor lashed out at the macho hero stereotype, saying that such television roles often make boys feel they have to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from Game of Thrones, has admitted that he wants to “very resolutely” face the issue.
“Personally, I feel very determined at this point - where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What did we teach men when they were growing up, compared to the problem we are now seeing?”
>>bos_Latn<< Kit believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on the screens, could be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity.
He continued, “What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught through TV and on the streets that makes boys feel that they must have these particular traits of a man?
I think that's actually one of the big questions of our time - how can we change that?
“Something went wrong for the boys.”
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be filming the sequels to Game of Thrones at its end next summer and said he had "done with the battlefields and the horses".
From November, Kit will star in a new performance of True West's stage play by Sam Shepard, the story of the film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife filming that show, which gave me a family and a future life,” he revealed.
>>bos_Latn<< Rose in the fantasy series that won the Emmy Award played the role of Ygritte, the love of Keith's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has said that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
>>bos_Latn<< Health workers say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said that people who get HIV in this way almost do not.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission by sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Research estimates that because of conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to address the problem, the Chinese government pledged free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff had leaked information about GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had leaked personal information to three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
A Los Angeles Democratic representative assures that these claims are spread by individuals of the “right wing” as well as websites.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, and was released by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
>>bos_Latn<< Information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address revealing the source of the data belongs to Waters' office, as well as information about the representative's staff member, The Hill newspaper reported.
"These unfounded allegations are completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations - is by no means responsible for the leak.
These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs Waters' statement quickly attracted critics online, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that Waters doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do mustn't be angry.
He mustn't be defiant.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running against Waters in the general election, also tweeted.
“It’s important if it’s true,” he wrote.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed “relevant bodies and law enforcement” of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are identified and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Review of “Johnny English: Back on the Job” by Rowan Atkinson
It is now common in every new British film to look for Brexit messages, and it seems to be so in the new screening of the Johnny English action series, whose first sequel, Johnny English, was first shown in 2003 and returned to the big screens in 2011 with the title "Johnny English Rides Again".
Will the twisted self-satire about how worthless we are obviously become a new national export opportunity?
Johnny English's inept eyes and rubber face are once again allowed to complicate situations, while his name tells him more than anything that it is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a wacky secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to "diluted" glamour, resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of Mr Bean's character and is somewhat reminiscent of that guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
His character is also inspired by a traveler and a mysterious world man once played by Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, which is the epitome of chaos.
>>bos_Latn<< There are one or two handy moments in this latest release of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is evident, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually redundant, especially now that “serious” film titles such as “007” and “Mission Impossible” offer elements of comedy themselves.
Humor seems to be meant for children, not adults. In my opinion, Johnny English’s wacky events are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson’s mute gags embodied in Mr Bean’s character.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
The hacker entered Britain’s top-secret spy web network and revealed the identities of all British agents, much to the dismay of an agent on duty, played by Kevin Eldon in a unfortunately brief appearance.
This overflowed with the prime minister’s patience, a bloated and belligerent character who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson tries to faithfully portray the character she is supposed to represent to Theresa May, but she didn’t really get the material to do something with.
Intelligence consultants reveal to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be careless with Johnny English's head and beard who is currently employed as the headmaster of some fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are a few handsome gags here because English teaches rock-and-roll spying.
Englisha is quickly brought to government premises for an emergency meeting, where she meets again with Bough, a former partner and his eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so two members of Her Majesty’s Secret Service who are doing everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful, fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, who is portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously influenced by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems, the vicious Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous occasions: disguised as waiters set fire to a fancy French restaurant, causing a huge mess by smuggling on Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes complete anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headphones to find out what the interior of Volta's house looks like.
Everything is done right for this latest sequel, but no matter how attractive and ostentatious the film is, it still contains quite a few children's elements.
Quite a mediocre accomplishment.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I wondered again, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would fit his talent?
The Labour Party denies working out a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan to make the British work four days a week and get paid for the five-day work.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on to workers the savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could "fit" into the party's economic agenda and plans to favour the country's workers' interests.
The trade union congress supported switching to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day work week will not be realized overnight, but it does represent an aspiration that fits the approach that this party has towards balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party also promised a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not accept this aspiration in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "A four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to elaborate on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to seize power from the hands of “faceless directors” and “profits” in utility companies.
Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire stakes because the Labour government could make “deductions” based on perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 percent of private company capital to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week and questioned whether the agency's conclusion could affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility the FBI might reveal something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” said Kennedy.
“I said going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after the allegations were made, and asked, ‘Did you do it?’
>>bos_Latn<< He was determined, unwavering, unequivocal."
>>bos_Latn<< Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
“I’m determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and would really need a strong charge to change that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has firmly denied everything,” Graham said.
"None of the people she named could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
>>bos_Latn<< I don't see anything has changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive star list and an equally impressive mission - ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only star performances, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, phone calls, or any other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, given that it has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” where people feel that signing an online petition or tweeting really changes something?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters who sought to achieve a range of different goals.
>>bos_Latn<< He argues that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to an amount of more than $37 billion that will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition”, a partnership of investors and implementers in the UK that advocates “helping children develop to their full potential”, with the promise that after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the world’s citizens, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in this area.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, an ambassador for The Power of Nutrition Foundation, told an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the “The Power of Nutrition” project, which will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on its website that is, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responds: “It will be a long and difficult road . . . we will sometimes fail.
>>bos_Latn<< But we will succeed, as have the great civil rights movements and against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger.
>>bos_Latn<< The performances of Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe belong among some of the performances at this year's event in New York City to be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as ‘blockade’ to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, according to U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke said Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in the area as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and the blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed those attending the event hosted by the non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance, which presents itself in the US as the “voice of energy consumers”.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, saying they were actually the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, and he says Russia is “using the same trick” in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made simultaneously with the Trump administration's intention to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “captured” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked a reaction from Germany which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “seriously consider” the possibility of running for president in 2020, according to Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “seriously consider” running for president after mid-term elections.
During an immediate meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running herself.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman at the helm,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president."
Warren expressed her opinion of President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that “this country is heading in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not think she should run in 2020.
According to a study by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
>>bos_Latn<< Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent voting for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names discussed in connection with the potential 2020 race for president are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident that took place on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after he returns, is comparable to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general issue about which he is silent and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the military, have given for this country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and has been charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing reports of domestic violence, and possessing a weapon in an alcoholic state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla City Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support review of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and counties filed a friendly report in Washington on Friday to provide support to an asylum seeker who disputes the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who backed Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as countries facing ubiquitous problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the U.S. has changed the immigration committee’s decision in 2014 to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
“All applications for asylum are dealt with on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the action, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” a friend of the court said in a statement.
Lawyers further argued that policies denying immigrants entry hurt the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “ensure the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“The asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems - not even all the serious ones - that people face all over the world on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The situation is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her boy, who was shaking in a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Emergency vehicles are bringing in bodies every minute.
>>bos_Latn<< Government scarcity of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rummaging through the flooded stuff, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-degree earthquake, were packed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a back and shoulder fracture, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors for continuous severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed inside the rubble of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ through ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily that promoted the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of abusing the U.S. press for spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid addition to the newspaper China Daily in Iowa's top-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on November 6, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials in a statement to Reuters characterized as a new phase of Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliations at the start of the trade war are designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa that have supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register newspaper, Branstad states that China "now doubles that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at a newsstand in Beijing, you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China’s disturbing economic trajectory because the media is under firm pressure from the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Kavanaugh's debacle has driven voters away ahead of mid-term elections, analysts warn
With many Republicans standing with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defending him over several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding the event were very uptight, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to cast their vote.
Such things cannot be brought back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University College of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
>>bos_Latn<< Reeher expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) final insistence on conducting an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it either tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a newspaper in Washington, D.C. on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted: “November is coming!”, protesting in the Senate hallway as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee prepared to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say they’re already at a high level, which is true.
But they could also be taller, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29, who, while they don't like the president, often don't go to the polls."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest there could be a negative reaction if Republicans proceed with confirmation.
“It’s a real mess for the Big Old Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week.
“It’s not just the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was benched for the Reserves, it’s also the way Republicans approached it and treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps select Democrats, told the news agency.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who they will believe after witnessing Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more leaning toward him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe the truth of Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same about Ford.
Following Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that she was shown her genitalia at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is being developed based on Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal network data storage” or POD.
It may include contact lists, appointment lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
>>bos_Latn<< It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that the decision on who can access what information is entirely the user's.
The company calls this “personal data empowerment.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to company chief executive John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who have signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, developers from around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would turn around overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a press release on Saturday that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts State Institute of Technology (MIT).
>>bos_Latn<< In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the network's neutrality debate.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the First World War with the Victoria Cross
A celebration in honour of the only Anglican priest who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter in World War I was held in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
>>bos_Latn<< However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received Britain's highest military honour.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's undertaking for which he received this recognition.
According to a report by the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Channel of St Quentin "through very thick fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front lines and, with “incredible courage,” led the unit forward before rushing the Polish cannon without any help and mowing down three of the military squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never accomplish, and that arouses humility.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to be participating in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that a lot of people will give."
Lovers of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Piggy Peppa
Imagine this: staying up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches and being unable to follow the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they were shown live at night on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, viewers in the UK were left in shock when the transmission was interrupted by Piglet Peppa.
Many were not at all impressed after only staying awake for the fight until the early hours of the morning.
One fan described the interruption on Twitter as “some kind of sick joke”.
“According to state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Yup, "Powder Peppa."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said he would align his schedules to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I consider reruns, I think we can probably work something out,” Coker said.
“But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until Sunday, when it will already be Monday in our country.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were a lot of correspondence that wasn't even friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. lt's a national issue.
I can promise you that next time it won't come.
We'll keep five fights instead of six, which we usually do. We tried to give more to our fans, but we overdid it.
It’s an unfortunate circumstance.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' about sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to the others because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that until he started high school, he wasn’t aware that “not everyone is like me.”
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, which is run by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that winning the Olympics has been less important to him since he became a father.
The show's regular host, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than the rest because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference from the rest were the real things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed.
He says he wanted to prove that he was “someone and something”, so as not to disappoint anyone when they eventually learn about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a prominent figure advocating for LGBT people and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games - in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to find himself in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference had never been a problem for him.
“When you’re going through so much so young,” he said, referring to his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “he said it’s hard to find someone the same age and he experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, the whole story would have been about ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold medals.
>>bos_Latn<< Robbie is my gold Olympic medalist."
>>bos_Latn<< His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn’t accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be here long enough to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand as he breathed out, and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and died that I finally became aware that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"All I knew was that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for the selection of the first song - " Proud" by singer Heather Small , which echoed in it during the preparation for the Olympic Games , and which always gives the chills .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to regain full form to avoid an awkward turning point.
Mickelson, who plays a record twelfth time in this two-year competition, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's games with four balls and fours.
>>bos_Latn<< Rather than being at the center of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and working out his game in the practice area in hopes of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the peak of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National pitch, where the long bumpy pitch routinely penalizes imprecise kicks.
And if the pitch itself is not intimidating enough, Mickelson faces precision British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who won all four matches this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, reach a hot start, Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said that he had confidence in his man - more than that and couldn't say.
“He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.”
He has been a great contributor to teams in the past and this week.
I'm sure I didn't mean for him to play two games.
I imagined there would be more, but that's how it turned out, and we felt that's how we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Fald's record for the number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career that never truly reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence also brought some intangible value to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy for it,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun with him this week as well, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, where captain Seve Ballesteros' team had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended in their victory with a narrow difference of 141–142.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a narrow difference,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after observing the 2018 team that won with a score of 5x3 on Friday and led yesterday with a score of 10x6 at the Le Golf National course.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll play at full power.
Get out there and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the flooring's on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware of who is standing opposite us - the greatest players in the world."
Delighted by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run in this direction.
Tomorrow we have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow is the first day of the show, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to play with your partner when everything is going well, but when you’re there as an individual, they’re on the final test of your golfing ability.
This is the message that you have to pass on to the players, and it is that tomorrow they have to give their best.
Now leave your teammate because he has to give his best too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they did with teammates, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those big turnarounds on the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up a loser after Europe performed a “miracle at Medina”.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had encouraged his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should strive to achieve excellent results at the very beginning like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that momentum moves in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on mid-matches.
>>bos_Latn<< Accordingly we organized our lineup and placed the boys as if, you know, we were going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the top half.
I decided that this group of guys would go in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of selected players for individual matches.
Germany's new warship put on hold again
The latest German Navy frigate was due to be launched in 2014 to replace Cold War-era old warships, but will not be ready at least until next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The launch of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, reports the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, commissioned by the Navy back in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period, and it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to their home ports.
However, constant delays mean that state-of-the-art warships - which are said to allow Germany to display power abroad - will become obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The F125 made all the headlines last year, when the German navy officially refused to let the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
>>bos_Latn<< This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key “software and hardware flaws” that would render the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
>>srp_Latn<< Software deficiencies were especially important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors ? half as much as on the older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, the ship has been shown to be dramatically overweight which reduces its efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice the weight of ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the navy was in fact "out of ships capable of deployment".
The official said the problem increased over time, as the old ships were put out of commission, and there were no replacement vessels.
>>srp_Latn<< He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Wárttemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
National Foundation eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
New research conducted on the Scottish Highlands estate aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
>>bos_Latn<< There is hope that the results will clarify the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will follow ordinary and marsh dwarf bats, as well as brown long-eared and river bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key places around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile examinations using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of the sound of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat voting and what kind it does.
A habitat map and a report will then be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
>>bos_Latn<< Rob Dewar, an NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as creating meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
>>bos_Latn<< They are threatened by construction and landscaping work affecting shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles in the path of their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
>>bos_Latn<< There are ten trained specialists, who regularly conduct research, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescues.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threeve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten bat species inhabiting Scotland.
>>bos_Latn<< The manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal area for them.
“Here in Threave we have a huge space for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
>>bos_Latn<< However, there is much more we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other facilities will help us better understand what they need to progress."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since unintentional destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young, thus possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal for them to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative for the Scottish Bat Protection Association, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their population is progressing."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
A Portuguese and Juventus gunman has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 at the time to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," says the five-time Golden Ball winner to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the footballer added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they called “unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns,” Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that “99 percent” was a “good guy” who was let down by the “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed for injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of reprisals" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to rescind the deal because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to Italian giant Juve as part of a 100m-euro transition.
Brexit: UK will ‘forever regret’ losing carmakers
The UK will “forever regret” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
Japan's automaker said the impact of waiting at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will experience production deadlocks in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal due to possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just in time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a break at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
Toyota could not hold more supplies than it needs in a day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
“We need to make a deal. We want to reach the best possible deal that will allow us not only to maintain our present success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told the BBC’s Radio 4 programme today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers shows that we must absolutely be able to continue this very successful array of supply chains.”
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite union, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, after those jobs leave, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by another week” as the battle continues over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s election interference, ties between Trump’s associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thus threaten Mueller’s independence has been fuelling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid announcements that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he “would not like” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
>>bos_Latn<< On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the lawsuits against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News television on Sunday.
Asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account everything else that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to a dislike of the "theatrical behavior" of television reporters, although she said, "I will not oppose the fact that they are showing off."
She then hinted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is organising more meetings to answer questions than any president before him,” she said, adding without giving evidence: “We’ve analyzed the numbers.”
Short speeches will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists have a chance to directly ask the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make this happen often, and you might have seen it in the last few weeks, and just that you can talk to the President of the United States will replace brief addresses to the press."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the assembled journalists.
Health minister writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland over fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU staff employed by the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed to covering the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union for a withdrawal continued, moving towards expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
>>bos_Latn<< The Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, was undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a Saturday defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores club with a score of 31–27, reports Mike Organ of Tennessean.
Tennessee head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He got to the playing field and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and sending him for further tests.
A representative from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had stepped out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there were no "details of the type/range of injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing experience, plays his first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five tackles before exiting the game, reaching a total of 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Under new plans by conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
>>bos_Latn<< The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's bid to attract young voters
>>bos_Latn<< An increase in the levy will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom - and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's effort to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The increase in the levy will be levied from individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional levy of the current levy, including the increase introduced two years ago to other homes and properties purchased for the purpose of issuing the levy, can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects that this move will raise 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the newly built properties in London are purchased by residents who do not reside in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the levy to help more young people reach their first home.
He accused major construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting land, and urged Mrs May to drop quotas on affordable real estate to fix the “shame over the housing situation” in Britain.
>>srp_Latn<< Corbyn announced proposing a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to nothing-induced evictions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to the renewal of the British dream that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes as easily as hardworking Britons.
The dream of owning a home has become too far away for many people, and the shame of homelessness is still very real."
Jack Ross: 'It is my ultimate ambition to govern Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is to become Scotland’s manager one day.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the First League, with three points short of the lead.
>>bos_Latn<< This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after leading St Mirren again in the Scottish Football Championship last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always pulled me back.
But this opportunity could only be achieved if I were successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland, include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cani.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he did not feel fear because he inherits such famous names in such a large club, having previously declined calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at this point will be measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful if I could take the club there again.”
Ross only turns third in his managerial career, after a period during which he was assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the brink of falling out to the title winner the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” Alloe recalled.
“I really believed that managing was what was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I was doing well, making a solid living and enjoying some pretty successful moments.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
>>bos_Latn<< I'm still going through it in terms of stress and job pressure, but managing seems like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I do. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for a pint is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to research.
The summer heat wave increased revenue for British pubs struggling with finances, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars generated a 2.7 per cent increase in July, but restaurant revenues were down 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the Business Advisory Office of the Chief Controller of Business Books, who collected the data, said: “The continued good weather and England’s participation in the World Cup that took longer than expected meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pub revenues rose by 2.8 percent, with restaurants now being even more affected.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant revenues in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly served have made much greater gains on equal terms compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mostly served were also affected by the heat, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed breweries and bars, sales of beverages rose by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman, RSM’s analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the external market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle with difficulties, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales year-on-year will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not come at a worse time for the leaders of the locals where food is served, and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed respite."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand share growth.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and an industry benchmark has been established.
One in five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” pages
The news has heightened fears of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that they show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, are opening up secret accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts - references to a photo sharing site.
The news has heightened fears of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a clean “main” account to show their parents, while also having private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenager who encouraged others by saying “rape me.”
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to owning private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'Voice of Athletes' on Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Committee as a non-executive director at the annual assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her wide-ranging experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making her a board member,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland."

Online Opinions Divided on a Traitor Advertisement Comparing Mothers to Cows
A company that compares mothers who breastfeed their children to cows who milk themselves has divided opinions on the internet.
To mark the launch of a product claimed to be “the world’s first silent wearable,” consumer technology firm Elvie has released a commercial inspired by the ironic music video to show the freedom the new issue gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with music that reads, “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you don’t see any tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, this isn’t a udder, it’s my breasts.”
Then the chorus follows: “Pump, pump, I feed the baby, pump, pump, milk my ladies.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their children are stolen a few days after giving birth," one person wrote.
Elvie discreetly fits in the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
The second person comments: “Understandably traumatic for mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added, “A totally lame advertisement.”
Others defended the commercial, with one woman admitting that her song was "funny".
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
Giving out milk made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it is.
“This is a great product,” she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who dispense milk (often in their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
>>bos_Latn<< This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they have all danced with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who dispense milk say that they feel like cows.
The Betrayal Elvie, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into the nursing bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even get out during the Betrayal.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “The publisher Elvie is so revolutionary that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Making a parallel between the portrayal of women and cows, we wanted to focus on betrayal and all its challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the severe rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children in the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were themselves immigrants without documents and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by stepping forward and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been recorded in criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors in the country are illegal, and much of them are criminal aliens.
>>srp_Latn<< Therefore, we continue the search for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
According to shelter workers, with the aim of speeding up proceedings for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention and not after 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear through a video conference call, not in person, to bring their case before the immigration court to obtain legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Proponents have said that these concerns are expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, signs that a child is being tortured are very likely to be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, while millions have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “fighting in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared” of terrorist groups and “any illegal presence of foreigners.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly trained and advised by both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return had been met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to resume political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia on the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with al-Qaeda, "which will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members soon to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited "to revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Mr. Trump should win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers likely hope, impeachment and scandal prematurely end his presidency.
In what would no doubt be “the most dramatic presidential final ever!”
>>bos_Latn<< There are currently no signs of viewer fatigue.
As of 2014, primetime ratings more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on primetime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped the ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on primetime nights.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” a government secretary who becomes president after the Capitol-destroying attack.
Nell Scovell, author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, “Because it makes me laugh,” said Mrs. Scovell.
In chaos, there is a fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade abortion law, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged viewers.
Still, you exceed the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts for the sixth hour discussing how Bob Woodward used “deep background” sources for his book “Fear,” about Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (a “clothing item full of arrogance,” according to the Washington Post) and the implications of Mr. Trump’s intimate descriptions, this one, anatomies.
For example, I will never look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.
“Part of what makes him feel like a reality show is that he feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawnshop, about the rotating cast and the daily plots of Trump’s show (fighting N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).

He could not be separated from the television, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
“I remember doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside pours into the most uncertain mid-term election race for congress
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to a reshuffle of congressional districts resulting in two candidates running for the same seat.
This recently reorganized district of the suburban portion of Pittsburgh highlights Democrat Conora Lamba, who won a seat in another district last spring in a special election.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The cards were drawn again after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally tailored in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign-funding battle between major party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely followed special March election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point advantage.
Political analysts gave little advantage to the Democrats.
U.S. to punish El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraw
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to call U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
But the fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development, and economic support.
The proposed fines, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to proceed to a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progress in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus actually stopped any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next step could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of justice by Trump, about which there is now considerable publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller reportedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly negotiated with Russia as part of its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes the majority, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to appear before voters again, and perhaps ultimately with a jury of his peers.
There are many of these "ifs" and I do not wish to suggest that Mr. Trum's fall is inevitable - nor those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to escape the years of carnage that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
Americans now face several of these points of inflection.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that he had secretly suggested shooting the president last year and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the FBI's recently commissioned investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he has been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
>>bos_Latn<< But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with a hook cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic ahead of face-to-face with Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrell earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in a season to a 2x2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that score as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game believing we could do something and we drew a point.
We might have been able to steal the game in the end, but, generally speaking, the tie is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big night in Europe.
Let’s hope we can win three points, but it will be a tough match because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I’m sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now it feels good.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Let's hope that we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can’t sleep because of the fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to start a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth ? as long as you have the money.
Arrange your legal documents: In the root prevent legal battles.
Hire healthcare professionals to identify a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider giving power of attorney to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your aging parent is in a situation that requires immediate medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please provide details in writing to be prepared.
“It’s not just about finances, but who are the doctors?” he asked.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that plan at hand."

His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Because the communications were cut off, aid officials were unable to get any information from Donggale province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-degree quake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu since the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow cove on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
>>bos_Latn<< The district, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of Sulawesi Province, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by the tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit western Donggalu in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the 2004 destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-president candidate, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by an Alaska state police officer.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su custody and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "innocently, of course" when asked about the plea, the network said.
Palina is charged with three Class A offenses, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offense, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
>>bos_Latn<< His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence, and possession of alcohol-related weapons.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck close to central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of impact.

Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for New York terror suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to attack a bike path along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he scuttled pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted a serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in New York's southern district.
Both of these points lead to a possible death penalty, according to a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury of Saipova struck with a 22-point indictment that included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors commonly use in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “considerable planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as “disgusting, cruel and corrupt.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement said.
>>bos_Latn<< Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York City, in 1953, when a married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to fly an ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "apparently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept the admission of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage has vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at a Conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to “feel pressure” from eurosceptics, as one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the marchers in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "gone out" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is highlighted by Tories prone to staying behind who join a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her compromise plan "Chequers" in the midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of staying and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the reaction and force eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr Bone told a rally of the Leave Means Leave campaign in Solihull that he wanted to “reject the Chequers.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added, “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to kick out the Chequers.”
Addressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight world wars to be subordinates.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone dismissed allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false."
Conservative and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, speaking to reporters saying, "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and elected us.
>>bos_Latn<< Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In a prominent message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises.”
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be forced to “feel the pressure” if they were about to let down a decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘you’re not going to get away with it.’
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us the victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
Many activists waved banners at Tories against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the conference's opening.
"These are people who tell us they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus plan, for the unhindered state of the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to ‘seriously consider’ running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday at an out-of-the-way gathering with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
He has been at the center of speculation for some time that he may oppose Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
He asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that implies a woman at the helm."
Arrest for the murder of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in a shooting with the fatality of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims that took place on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information about the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
>>bos_Latn<< On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help in identifying the man from the video.
>>bos_Latn<< Sims (20) was killed early on Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday at 247sports.
Wayde interfered to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime and possessing a weapon and that he had killed Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Sims, a 3rd-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games in 10 first-team games last season and averaged 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to world title after standings secures victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order would "play a major role in the race".
>>bos_Latn<< From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to enter traffic at the rear, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one lap later and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the free interior in danger of falling behind after a double move in the third turn defense.
>>bos_Latn<< Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran much of the race as he relied on his tyres to score a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally reached boxing in the 44th round, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was tough because Valtteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a truly remarkable job of achieving the formation finish," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “evil and nasty and dishonest.”
“The only thing that can happen and the nice thing that’s happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at publishing and leaking information to the public, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer...did you release the document to the public - ‘ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
Did we let go ... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the information had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, which she asked for.”
However, her denial was not met with approval from the president, who commented at a rally Saturday night: “Let me tell you something - it was a very bad body language.
>>bos_Latn<< Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, whom three women accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use these charges for their own ends.
“They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see wickedness, disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control,” the president said.
>>bos_Latn<< Elite League: Dundee Stars 5  3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
>>bos_Latn<< The Dundee Stars made up for their loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning at Dundee on Saturday by a score of 5–6.
>>bos_Latn<< The Giants came to a two-goal advantage in the early minutes with kicks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the homers to a tie, and then Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the victory.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee by a score of 2 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening game came in the fourth minute, to be exact, at 3:35 a.m., with Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford's assist to double the lead with a Beauvillier shot four minutes later.
In the game's hectic opening, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's tie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with a lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The homers regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to a tie in the power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen to Dundee's first lead at the end of the second third, and he took care of the win when his team was already halfway through to winning the last third of the game.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five games, hosted a team from Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers on Plane Avoid Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero after he was killed while ensuring the safe take-off of an aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower which was rocking hard.
It remained to ensure the safe take-off of the Batik Air aircraft on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
He then jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“My heart breaks for that,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggali, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is still believed to be increasing, as many bodies are still under rubble and many could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency vehicles are bringing in bodies every minute.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to the aid of the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline, which owns the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one man is missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In his statement, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, they cannot trace one of the passengers.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday, and that they were all in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
“That’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to break through the water reaching their waists to the emergency exit of the sinking aircraft.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair the pier also helped rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the aircraft sank in about 30 feet of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in accidents of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but that none of them were Air Niugini involved.
An analyst presents a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up a case in Saturday's retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to piece together a puzzle about the whereabouts of 29-year-old indictee Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he was, according to his own claims, with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
>>bos_Latn<< Sanford testified on Saturday and stated that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "laying because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, erased her messages, calls and contact details from her phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based singing group The High Breed claims that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and a focus on social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.

Another black woman?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing after 'racist' message
A New York City nanny is suing the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, comparing the charge to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned on her arrival on her first working day in 2016 that her children's new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NEEEE ANOTHER BLACK WOMAN,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a note to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to his wife, she sent her twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After realizing her mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a “difficult” situation and fired Ms. Maurice because, as she claims, their then-ex-nanny, who was African-American, was doing a bad job, and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work and then went home.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for a dismissal fee and seeking damages of $350 per day for the period of six months for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do these things," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple countered claims that they were racist, saying that ending Maurica's employment was reasonable to do, due to fears that she would not be able to be trusted because of the insult afterwards.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent in the message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children to a person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife was only given two months of maternity leave after the baby was born and was in a "very difficult situation".
“You’re going to sue someone who’s in that situation.
"That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although court proceedings are still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify with the talking teddy bear, a new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who’s going to read the book for the first time before it’s published.
>>bos_Latn<< It's very funny what we know now about Paddington's tremendous success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a small teddy bear to write a children's book, would be optimistic when his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn’t a braggart,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it all felt like an accomplishment for your own child: you’re proud of him even though none of it is really your doing.
I think Paddington's success was seen that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed the credit solely to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say it was really bad and to believe he wouldn’t get away with it,” Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart working were slowly losing their effect and leaving her body system.
She died shortly before boarding, and that's when it all went out.
I just had to sit there and wait knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to keep it all inside.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I put my head down, and tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a great sense of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Messages from women in mourning on the bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a cook with an infectious smile that was waiting for a brilliant career.
“Everyone remembers him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill any room with joy."
Before his death, however, he left his job because he was in a “really dark state.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that this will have a negative effect.”
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea of cards “so that people know there’s someone you can go to and talk to, even if he’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt sad or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom - when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or want anything else."
She said his death was a major trauma to them, but they had to overcome it: “It all leaves a big hole in the family.
He's ripping us off.
>>bos_Latn<< But we will continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
“I thought we might be able to bring in a little unity if we really managed to get something like what he was looking for - a time and scope-limited investigation,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “disintegrating” amid the entrenched party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is prompted by the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections come in just five weeks, Nov. 6 - if, as expected, Republicans do not fare well, then they will be severely weakened in attempts to lead the desired man to election to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush constantly calls on the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI drafts its report?
The vote will be in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to snap with a decisive vote and confirm his seat on the Supreme Court.
North Korean defectors 'fall' under Kim's leadership
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Referring to data from the United Southern Alliance ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1127 defectors last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors are stricter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and the higher fees traffickers charge.
>>bos_Latn<< Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
>>bos_Latn<< The vast majority of defectors from the north eventually obtained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
>>bos_Latn<< China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work to liberate the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's foreign minister, blamed the U.S. sanctions for not making any progress since then.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and it is out of the question that under such circumstances we disarm first," Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if she ever acted like that, she would be ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost yelling and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated denigration" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not participate in the Supreme Court's work, as he showed he had prejudice against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself by saying that and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi backed down.
“I’ll say this: If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not capable of not only being in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law stemming from Roe v. Wade's proceedings, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether to recast some Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘isn’t that wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justified criticism, anger that has been building up for months and years - all this can't be solved without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual. What do you think?”
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be an executive and who said that she too cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to: ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.'"
And then she went on.
>>bos_Latn<< And I thought it was excellent."
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, is that, on one occasion when I was crying out of unspeakable anger, an elderly woman - a cold manager I was always a little afraid of - dragged me down the stairs.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
>>bos_Latn<< They think you're sad, so they'll be glad because they'll think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason she would not consider the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me through a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates already in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
They were called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign was already advanced, it lagged behind with fundraising, and vowed not to enter the race unless it raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of the supporters, who gave her $1,000 each to the men, only gave her $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?” she asked.
While she was saying she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so consumed with emotion ? gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration about the system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger about sexism ? that her throat was squeezed.
“You’d think I’d had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled the media’s reaction to her.
“You’d think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.”
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone.
“She was crying.”
How a trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The start of a trade war between the United States and China has echoed loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the rift between the countries can be of benefit to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week has emerged with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of products (150 billion pounds), actually taxing half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing retaliated each time in some way, and a tariff of five to ten percent on US$60 billion of goods was recently imposed.
China has promised to respond with a blow to the United States, and the world’s second-largest economy will certainly not surrender soon.
Washington's withdrawal could be achieved by yielding to demands, but public submission to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to drive economic steepness in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed,” said Abigail Grace, a strategic thinking scientist who focused on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in rebuilding a country that has been destroyed by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to establish a normal situation.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 - 10.5 at the Le Golf National Ground near Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during almost the entire tournament, on the 16th hole par 3, sent the ball into the water at the first blow, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of the 4 players who have ever made it to 5-0-0 since the tournament started in 1979.
Jordan Spieth's American was knocked out by Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest ranked European team player, with 5&4.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most wins in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop tears.

I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I won the cup again.
It's up to the team. I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who beat legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, by 2&1 in individual games on Sunday.
“I have incredible pride in winning over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play,” Rahm said.
>>bos_Latn<< Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
>>bos_Latn<< Unusual statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, and is located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
>>bos_Latn<< The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-flight golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we have resisted Europe.
We failed.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
>>bos_Latn<< All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to get over it, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, so we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off to the people.
We're outplayed."
