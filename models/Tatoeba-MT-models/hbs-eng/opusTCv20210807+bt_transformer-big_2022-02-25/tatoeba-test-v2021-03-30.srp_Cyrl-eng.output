The eagle is the king of birds.
That text is free-spirited.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She is a yoga teacher.
Show me what to translate.
Will you help me?
>>srp_Cyrl<< A three-month growth of 1.2% means an annual growth of 4.9%.
Thank you very much!
>>srp_Cyrl<< She was caught in the act.
I had lunch with him.
Picasso is a famous artist.
I have better things to do.
Tom got on the wrong bus.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom falls asleep again.
It's a little dog.
I can ski.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He is nearly six feet tall.
Sure, thanks.
I found an empty cage.
I study languages, I can help you if you want, and maybe I'd like you to help me too.
It's time to say goodbye.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The river that flows through Paris is called the Seine.
Get up!
We have a problem.
I called him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Everyone tells me I'm weird.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The supermarket is open Monday through Saturday.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sami was Layla's dance partner.
Tourists from all over the world come here.
Don't drink the water.
I need to find Tom.
She's my teacher.
Things aren’t always as they seem.
What am I doing here?
This is my wife, Edith.
New York is a big city.
I'm just fine, thanks for asking!
Tom hates you from the bottom of his heart.
Oh, really?
>>srp_Cyrl<< I should never have listened to you.
I mean, I exist.
Don't shoot!
I can't help it.
The top of the mountain was covered with snow.
I prefer cakes and sweets to alcohol, but I drink.
You're so skinny.
Can you keep a secret?
I have two daughters.
We're done for the day.
I'll never see her again.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You must miss your homeland.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Grammar is an extremely complex thing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Measure three times, cut once.
Where did you learn English?
I was just leaving.
Rest assured of that.
You'll be famous.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She received four e-mails.
How was your day?
I like mathematics.
It's a weapon.
Have a good time!
Tom will buy a new computer.
I love you both.
I'm an equal.
Memory loss is more psychological than physical.
>>srp_Cyrl<< For the next class, I want you to rewrite the text from any singer who is in English.
Romans, go home!
No one asked your opinion.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom knows the end has come.
I don't know.
She's in a bad mood.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stop moving!
I don't want you to see me naked.
Open the door to love.
There goes our bus.
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
Tom nodded his head.
Is there an objective history?
>>srp_Cyrl<< A hundred midwives, a limp child.
I had dinner with him.
By the way, where are you from?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Is that pure coincidence?
Coffee, please.
My water broke in the evening of the scheduled date.
Why am I here?
>>srp_Cyrl<< A little birdie told me.
No one trusts anyone anymore.
Tom's on the short list.
I saw the bus.
Be ready.
You said you were ready.
I prefer coffee and toast for breakfast.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I had/had some things to do before the meeting.
How are you these days?
You're too young.
My name is James, but please call me Jim.
I'm a student.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom died in his thirties.
Thank you very much, my friends!
Don't come in.
She was saving a living head.
Who knows?
I don't have any homework today.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Shut up and rip!
I know him well.
How would you translate that?
Who is this man?
Tell me what you want to drink.
Let's meet!
God knows.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Is he a doctor?
We can't go.
What a question!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't forget to do your homework, okay?
He's working on some pretty crazy projects.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Did I come at a bad time?
Can you come?
She's not a child anymore.
Don't take the bait.
Do not drink water.
Tom makes me laugh.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Are you happy?
I am so sorry to hear that! said the poet.
I'll get back to you as soon as I get there.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I got off at the wrong station.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't be insolent with me!
Good morning, everyone.
What time is it, please?
Start with counting.
Yeah, I love it!
Everybody says so.
Is it clear?
I saw Tom die.
Do you speak Romani?
It wouldn't make a difference.
I'd really like to see you again.
Does this make sense?
>>srp_Cyrl<< I exchanged opinions with Tom.
Her name is Lucifer.
Is it yours?
Tom, we have to take a cab to the station.
I'm trying to win her heart.
They say love is blind.
Eat slowly.
Keep trying.
We got off the train.
He's kind.
Stop that!
>>srp_Cyrl<< He gave up.
You owe me big time.
They're waiting for us.
You have no idea how right you are.
I've been looking for you.
I forgot.
Just close your eyes.
Everyone is the boss in their own home.
What school did you go to?
I wouldn't hurt them.
What's your name?
It was love at first sight.
Stop.
I'm not ready yet.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At least 50 passengers have died.
I know everything.
There is no rule without exception.
On what basis do we know that he is innocent?
My hands are cold.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The best lecture you can attend is the one you don't understand.
How was your day?
Sure!
Sign here.
Where did you get that idea?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't run before the ore!
In that case, let's go.
Tom was fired.
He is a hero to a hero.
I saw Marcus' house.
Refugees are welcome.
You're too young.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We have no such example.
You can't touch it.
What am I supposed to see?
It stinks.
I'll have dinner at seven.
I bought this yesterday.
How do you say "cat" in Spanish?
I haven't seen him in a while.
I haven't seen her in a while.
You'll see her.
Oh, it's a grilled cheese.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't be a road bully.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I burned my tongue.
Turn left.
I'll be back later.
What are you going to do today?
I'm just thinking out loud.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A young man is often thoughtless.
You think so?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Can we agree to disagree?
Not yet.
You're absolutely right.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Add more water!
Where there's grass, there's no water, where there's water, there's no grass.
It's great.
Your wish is my command.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is Mary's grandfather.
Open your mouth!
>>srp_Cyrl<< The fire spread to an adjacent building before firefighters arrived.
He took his clothes off.
He's American.
Without any doubt.
She's in a bad mood.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Let your imagination at will.
How about you?
What have you done to me?
Why me?
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you do, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You are a salve for the soul.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Ask the policeman!
>>srp_Cyrl<< We have five fingers on each hand.
What does the newspaper say?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Repairs were completed on the system after three years of volunteer work.
I need your signature.
She called me very late last night.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She received four e-mails.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
Turn right at the next corner.
I hope he doesn't notice my mistake.
He did not hide his disappointment.
We're out of food.
It's a nice time today.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Proletarians of all countries, unite!
I'm very impressed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Santa lives on the North Pole.
Please go.
I tried to be nice.
I'll keep you posted.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We need to prepare the ground for negotiations.
They laughed at his mistake.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I got off at the wrong bus stop.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Dr Jackson has a good relationship with the patient.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
I'm cooking lunch.
Our school was founded in 1990.
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
You're not finished yet?
You're very rude.
I eat here.
After you.
You drink coffee?
It works.
He needs her.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
What's your name?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is cold-blooded.
Hands up!
She doesn't speak English, let alone French.
She's a teacher.
We're finally here!
The professor's statement is almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
That's not like you.
She achieved her goal.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
Like I don't know!
They know you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I was buzzing with wonder.
"Did he elaborate?" "He did."
Not every lamp is magic.
I was very excited.
What happens now?
I need five more minutes.
Good to see you again.
What am I doing here?
I haven't forgotten.
Mini skirts are fashionable again.
What exactly are we looking for?
Hurry up!
He's addicted to Starbucks coffee.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fadil changed his mind.
It happens.
It's hers, isn't it?
>>srp_Cyrl<< This transcends all boundaries.
I miss you so much.
I have to go.
The window is made of glass.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I always keep my window open while I sleep.
I know those girls.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The road to a man's heart leads over his stomach.
I know him well.
What's your name?
I drink coffee.
Pick one.
Karin is Austrian.
The teacher explained to us what the poet wanted to say.
He is a free thinker.
I'm looking for work.
We're ready to go.
Don't move!
I took him to the most expensive restaurant on campus.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'm deeply ashamed.
Mom just went shopping.
I want to be with her.
The apples are red.
Why do you think that?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Elemental, my dear Watson.
In what name?
When was the last time we met?
She looks good for her age.
The little bird told me.
What was I supposed to do?
You're innocent.
When Marcus came, I was asleep.
The thief fled.
Eat it all.
Get lost!
Either way, you're wrong.
He knows a lot of people.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I feel bad because I lied.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Everyone says I look like my father.
Let me in.
What would you like to know?
Live long and feel good!
Choose one.
We went to school together.
Can I have your email, please?
Scientists interpret it in a different way.
Life begins when we realize who we really are.
Some people, regardless of their age, do not lose their beauty.
Let him pay for what he did.
This box is almost empty.
Are you done?
Sit down.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It is pronounced thus:
Turn left.
No way!
What did you learn today?
You're very rude.
Read this.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Detectives continue to investigate.
We're going to the mountains.
Don't say a word.
He often plays the guitar.
I'm not ready yet.
Mary began to disembowel.
You want to meet him?
Look over there.
In the morning we found a dolphin.
It's a snowman.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Be realistic!
I did it with a heavy heart.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Practice outside.
That is absolute truth!
I have no desire to live in a big city.
We have to act now.
A mother is a woman.
What was I supposed to do?
We visited the hippodrome, we visited the horse track.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Someday you'll understand.
I've been looking for you.
That's great!
Good-bye!
She never saw him.
Fortunately, I survived the accident.
Are we ready to go?
That's quite a problem.
Good, as always.
Does Tom eat fish?
The garage is rusty.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Do you love me? he asked.
It's no problem.
Everything happens for a reason.
Tom's got all kinds of problems.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Several trees fell during the storm in our surroundings.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
He lives alone in the forest.
I burned my tongue.
He's good.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom has a strong German accent.
I watched Tom die.
Tom's having a beer.
Did you bring the hair dryer?
Do you speak Chinese?
Aren't you from Australia?
It is the third largest city in Serbia.
She's making my life miserable.
I am never home on Sundays.
Open fire!
I told Tom to wait.
Please hurry.
The birds sing.
I love watching you work.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Birds fly.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Did Tom pull a fat end?
>>srp_Cyrl<< I am not afraid of death, but of dying.
We like him.
That's a good answer.
I don't need anything.
He was running.
He is not a scientist, but he is our friend.
Fish, please.
Do you teach French at your school?
I took the first step.
How far is it from here?
I never thought of it that way.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He is eternally dissatisfied.
I called him.
Stay calm.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Can I replace this?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Everyone tells me I'm weird.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Did you return the book to the library?
Keep listening.
Do you have a headache?
I can't trust him.
I want to live in the city.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
That was just the beginning.
The book was sold out.
Welcome back.
We can't go back.
I'll take a shower.
Could anything be more romantic?
It's none of our business.
Why do you ask?
It's snowing.
I thought you needed help.
Does this make sense?
Dad said no.
Go find something else to do.
>>srp_Cyrl<< One day you should try it.
Tom's on edge.
Tom reads a lot.
I'm not saying anything.
Please stop here.
I've been there twice.
Actions speak louder than words.
They say love is blind.
Thank you for accepting my Facebook friend request.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He started yelling.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Are you ready?
In general, children love sweets.
The phone is a wonderful device.
You will feel better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
What's your name?
He'll be finished soon.
The police are after me.
Did you see anyone there?
Either way, you're wrong.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
Nobody said anything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He is a true aristocrat.
We know.
He lied to you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Carthage must be destroyed!
How much does it cost?
Isn't that what you wanted?
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was hot in every sense of the word.
Are you ready?
It's time to get up.
That's my money, too.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He exhaled.
You can't touch that.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The government fell after a vote in parliament.
The notebook's not yours, it's his.
I don't speak Japanese.
That's not the main question.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The girl eats bread.
It's not like that.
What are you going to do today?
What's on your mind?
>>srp_Cyrl<< I was as cold as a spritzer.
Here's the key to my apartment.
My house, my freedom.
Stop it!
It is said that love is blind.
Why is love so hard?
I don't know if I'll have time.
I went there voluntarily.
She shouted at him, but he didn’t hear her.
After silence, what most accurately expresses the unspeakable is music.
It's not over until it's over.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Don't work too hard!
We'll have to walk now.
>>srp_Cyrl<< How about we build a group on Facebook so we can discuss learning foreign languages?
It's not that bad.
You owe me an apology.
What happens now?
>>srp_Cyrl<< How about some chocolate cheese?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The cost of living is rising.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is the best student in the class.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
This is a sentence.
Life is sweet.
I'm deeply ashamed.
I don't know who they are.
Where's the toothpaste?
Trust me.
We know enough.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
I'm so into her.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This takes forever.
She has short hair.
Happy Mother's Day!
I feel safe with you.
The Chairman opened the meeting.
It was raining.
I miss you so much.
Is the world unfair?
I'm Tom's grandfather.
I had dinner with him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Am I seeing things?
You're wrong.
Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove that?
You disappoint me.
Excuse me.
I wasn't home all day yesterday.
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay until tomorrow.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He's everything, just not fair.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Show me the photos!
Heather trusts me.
I know him well.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Without tools there is no craft.
I work in a language school.
It's always been that way.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Deaf people can talk in sign language.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Jane lies sick in bed.
I'm warning you!
I've been looking for you.
It's all important.
The whole country is talking about it!
Which way are you going?
>>srp_Cyrl<< And they lived happily ever after.
Tom is blushing.
Give me another example.
He doesn't know where he's supposed to be.
I won't say anything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Put the book on the top shelf.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Simplicity is the pinnacle of refinement.
What does he live on?
What would I do without you?
You're reckless.
That's new.
Please, sit down.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
They work together.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'll probably never use this again.
You're human.
Tom lost his job.
The ladies have an advantage.
It's mine, not his.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The wind blows like a silly.
I'll take the car to town, so I can drop you off on the way.
Why do you need so many shoes?
They may need a little money.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He who wounds early, two fortune grabs.
They are Spanish villages to me.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Better a sparrow in the hand, than a pigeon on a branch.
Don't move!
Who in the family wears pants?
Tom's undercover.
Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited.
Have fun while you can.
I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
I baked bread.
Why are you acting like a child?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stop worrying.
We'll have to wait and see.
I'm as hungry as a wolf.
Etherium and Bitcoin are cryptocurrencies.
Tom must have had a key.
She expects us to help her.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It will last for an eternity.
You didn't answer the question.
I love Korean food.
I have confidence in you.
I can't sit still.
How was your day?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is an ex-con.
Get out of here!
Tom nodded.
Please continue.
When are you leaving?
Good always conquers evil.
I don't care what he says.
I have a headache today.
I'm completely penniless.
I've been looking for you.
Enough!
I'll be home tomorrow.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The teacher explained the meaning of the word to us.
They did an unthinkable job.
He was drinking too much again.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She doesn't like being told what to do.
>>srp_Cyrl<< When the willow gives birth to grapes!
A man’s character is his destiny.
Play it again, Sam.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom made Mary do it.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I've never seen Tom this busy.
Seems like you haven't been yourself lately.
I wonder whose sentence that is.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom was buying time.
Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't get the name.
What did you like the most along the way?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom suggested that Mary go to the doctor.
I have a few gifts.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Over the last few days I've done research regarding making money using the project, but I think all options will require a sudden change in my lifestyle, which is a tricky thing.
You are my sun.
She divorced her husband.
I changed my mind.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Based on the data I presented to you, what story would you go out with?
He's not missing anything.
I miss him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom played on the strongest card.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He left his family and moved to Tahiti.
We're just getting started.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Please, move away.
Will you do that for me?
In my beginning is my end.
How would you translate that?
It's almost half past three.
I bought this yesterday.
The kids are playing outside.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Call me any time I always have a shoulder to cry on.
Thanks for coming!
What is your blood type?
I found him a book.
I'm thirsty.
Simplicity is the highest level of sophistication.
You want to meet her?
We're out of food.
You're the boss.
Oh, no!
I forgot the baby monitor.
Tom's upstairs.
He's kind.
Just relax.
Smoking is prohibited in every part of the restaurant.
You don't even know his name, do you?
What would you like to know?
He's very educated.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He's back on his toes again.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Our yacht club has ten members.
Can I walk you home?
I have a few friends.
I can't wait.
Do you believe in eternal life?
What do you have to do?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The horses sleep standing up.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Who are you running from?
Don't argue with me.
You don't have to yell, I'm not deaf!
>>srp_Cyrl<< She is currently violent, she should be avoided.
Tell him I'm innocent.
It's for my friend.
What's that?
He surrendered.
I can't wait forever.
Is your car blue?
He lied to you.
Don't be late.
He has two cars.
Men remain children all their lives.
Come on, admit it.
The two of us are so different.
You don't have to tell me twice.
I bought flowers.
He asked me to help him.
What happens now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Someone called.
Winter is a time of snow.
Under what name?
>>srp_Cyrl<< What are you going to do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
Who are you really?
Who waits, welcomes.
I'll have to say, yes.
I want a sword like this.
Tell her.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Move quietly.
I will have to change my habits.
Can you speak Latin?
Come back.
Everyone has the right to the protection of moral and material interests arising from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the creator.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is hiding under the table.
I'm the one who's paying.
You're a very beautiful woman.
You're a little liar.
I'm a teacher.
Where do you live?
Why would I want to kill you all?
The bathroom is upstairs.
She took care of her son.
Somehow we survived.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It seemed to me that Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to be doing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He abruptly stopped smoking.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
Don't thank me.
What's the difference?
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what's it to you?
I just got up.
How does it feel?
My dog is blind, but he likes to go outside and take a walk.
This is how it was supposed to be.
I don't like to work.
My French sucks.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We survived somehow.
It stinks.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Faith can move mountains.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Bill is two years younger than me.
Here's her picture.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Who's your favorite wrestler?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I shot the bear.
Not a word.
Sorry, I'm late for the session.
It's 5:00 in the morning in Brazil.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do you think the situation will improve?
This is not taught in school.
Is it clear?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stop resisting!
I have two flowers.
Move it!
Are you a maniac?
Well done!
>>srp_Cyrl<< A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
What time do you have breakfast?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Due to bad weather, the plane was delayed.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Can I take your dictionary?
I was in a great mood.
Tom's a nerd.
Show me the photos!
>>srp_Cyrl<< She fantasized about becoming a nurse.
He's not American, he's English.
How do you say “thank you” in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
His misfortune has taught me so much.
Are we ready to go?
Why not?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom's tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It was just whipped cream on the cake.
Pick one.
He got what he wanted.
She's drinking like a schmuck.
They need each other.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Introduce me to Tom.
>>srp_Cyrl<< After a long consideration, I ended up making things at random.
You're absolutely right.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is ruthless.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Termites eat wood.
You failed me.
What's this?
Me too.
That was very good.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She takes care of her old mother.
That can't be true.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Go straight ahead.
Just like beans.
It's empty.
Where did you get that idea?
Maria nodded.
I'm out.
I can't sit still.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Happy Easter!
I owe you an apology.
Which way are you going?
Please read between the lines.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I had a quick lunch.
The wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Give me an example.
What day is tomorrow?
Can you give an example?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom drinks like a schmuck.
Is that what you want?
That's not like you.
I look, but I can't see.
We're close friends.
Thomas was completely drunk.
How many people live on Earth?
So be it.
If I love you, what's it to you?
Peter loves Jane.
Is this a real diamond?
Are you free tonight?
>>srp_Cyrl<< I like to watch you dance.
They replaced coal with oil.
It was snowing.
>>srp_Cyrl<< How can I say that in your language?
That's not a good sign.
I didn't tell him you were here.
It's good to see you again.
Why are you acting like this?
He's not missing anything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< We live in the atomic epoch.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mary makes her living sewing.
Where will Tom sleep?
Did you get enough sleep last night?
That wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
>>srp_Cyrl<< "Do you have a nickname?" "Yes, Rick."
Nothing is working for me today.
This is Brian Rock.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Two guys ran out of the room.
It’s never too late to learn.
We have to find them first.
Tom was very scared.
It's snowing.
You can't blame everything on Tom.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom looked much different after his haircut.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
I'm learning now.
When did you get home?
He asked me to help him.
This isn't true.
I took the first step.
Can you keep a secret?
I nodded once.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do not waste words in vain.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Did you do it on purpose?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't get hooked.
Tom is living proof that you don’t have to be smart to be successful.
>>srp_Cyrl<< This is a good textbook.
How long have you been a teacher?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do you think I should write to Tom?
We ran out of the building.
I'm a beginner.
This tea is good.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
>>srp_Cyrl<< It all played out at the speed of light.
What's your story?
I pissed him off.
I pretended not to see.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I tried to be kind.
Don't come in, I'm naked.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Success was only partial.
I'm not 100% sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The insurer's blown over.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We protested peacefully.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mary was furious as a lynx.
Turn to the left.
Don't make a sound!
I know as much as you do.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I can resist anything, except temptation.
I paid for it.
Did you bring the hair dryer?
You are under oath.
I wish I'd known.
I don't think so.
Are you looking for something specific?
Don't worry!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Caroline is sad, because she can't get pregnant.
I took off my wig.
That's my cat.
He's standing right there.
He is known as a great painter.
Why are you mad at me?
What's your name in Bosnian?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom travelled on the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
I'll go.
What's all this fuss about?
I don't understand why they're such good friends, they barely have anything in common.
This is a book.
The bedroom is upstairs.
What's wrong with you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< She hated him.
What are you going to do today?
Taxi is expensive.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Logic is obviously your strong suit.
I'd like to kiss you.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He told me I was cute.
My father's so old he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
You're absolutely right.
You changed my life.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He ran away from her.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The bird on the roof is a crow.
How to call a taxi?
You didn't answer the question.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was bare-chested and barefoot.
I can ski.
What makes you say that?
It's snowing today.
I have a headache today.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I think Tom got the fat end of it.
I'll do my homework tomorrow.
By the way, where do you live?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The office doors are yellow.
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
I have a lot of friends.
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
Is it yours?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The house is made of brick.
Everybody's lying.
I took the first step.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You want some fruit juice?
Can you help us?
Stay calm.
One day it will be mine.
I've had enough!
That was terrible.
I'm not gonna let you do that.
How was French class?
Stay positive.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I pissed him off.
Is breakfast included in the price?
Is everything okay between us?
What can I say?
Her name was unknown.
Where's my room?
In our wide world, there are countless lifestyles, languages and cultures.
We have a serious problem.
It's none of our business.
That's your whole wisdom!
I know I'm not perfect.
I'm thirsty.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't stir the porridge!
We haven't completely lost.
They need each other.
I'll tell you the truth now.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do you want to know something specific?
>>srp_Cyrl<< I like to watch you dance.
Hi, Tom.
I can run.
Closer.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He came at midnight.
Happy New Year!
I didn't understand anything at today's seminar.
Tom is cheating on his wife.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The two negations cancel each other out.
Go away!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do you want to see something specific?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Thomas was furious as a lynx.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Hungry puppies barking in the street.
Tom sells cars.
I didn't understand what he said.
Are you following me?
France is in Western Europe.
Can I come in?
What's your full name?
I got it.
What are you gonna do today?
The students are back.
What did you buy?
Is there any evidence?
I'll do it with pleasure.
I don't know who they are.
I saw Tom die.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Isn't that what you wanted?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Have fun while you can.
I won't say anything.
Diversity is the spice of life.
He's here.
We talked about it all night.
They decided to get married.
I get up early.
Don't thank me.
When are you going home?
There's no match for him.
Democracy is the worst form of governance, unless all other forms have been tried so far.
Wait.
I wanted to help you.
Your shoes are here.
What's he doing?
How much time do I have?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The web was invented in 1989 by Tom Berners Lee.
>>srp_Cyrl<< To the whole world - good evening, good day and good morning.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The wind gave way.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I'm coming to save you!
That's his weak spot.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Time has flown by.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I come in peace.
Who are you?
Be reasonable.
What's your name?
You're not bad.
Am I wrong?
What do the newspapers say?
Belgrade is the capital of Serbia.
She's a friend of my sister's.
That lie sounds nice, but I'd like to hear the plain truth.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom hires a private detective to follow Mary.
She likes Russian pop.
I told Tom to wait.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He exhaled.
I wouldn't hurt him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The pantry is empty.
I don't understand German.
The average living space in America is twice as large as in Japan.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
Champagne, please.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The situation was very dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
The conference was not very successful.
Drive carefully.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It should work like this.
Why are you leaving?
Time has no end, it's endless.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom only drinks coffee without caffeine.
>>srp_Cyrl<< If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The document got into enemy hands.
It's not too late to come to work at four o'clock.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You're staring at TV again instead of doing your homework!
I bought flowers.
What a man you are!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Spread Esperanto!
His book is red.
Books have their destiny.
He's running.
No one trusts him anymore.
I haven't forgotten it.
Back off.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom uses that word often.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They can't get enough of each other.
That is absolute truth!
It's all right.
That's your problem.
That hurts.
Stay calm.
Turn left at the next corner.
How long have you been here?
Let's sit.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You have a dirty imagination.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Stop gambling.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Her hobby was collecting old coins.
What would I do without you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He's always unhappy.
Have fun while you can.
We're of the same variety.
Whose handwriting is this?
Be yourself.
I'm used to it.
Thank you very much.You should also feel free and ask for help in the future.
Excuse me, who is this woman?
Everything will be fine in the end. If it's not fine, then it's not even the end.
Are you done yet?
Let's go to the movies.
Is it yours?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The proposal was wonderful.
They know you.
I can't.
I've been asleep since ten in the evening.
Bye.
Come on.
Cows eat grass.
Don't let a chance like this slip through your fingers.
It was just like that.
I'm sorry, the connection is still busy.
What's the matter with you?
What do you have to do?
>>srp_Cyrl<< "You talk too much," he said.
I got off the train.
You promised you'd help me.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was bare-chested and barefoot.
I don't know why my head hurts.
Thomas is crazy about Mary.
Are you Uyghur?
Don't be mad.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As it came, so it went.
It's not as bad as it looks.
I'm mad at Tom.
Do you speak Greek?
Fish, please.
Everything has its price.
Did you do it on purpose?
I have no intention of answering all the questions.
>>srp_Cyrl<< That publishing company is solvent.
Pick one.
I'm too old for something like this.
This model can be combined with any color.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Enjoy it while you still can!
I will never find true love.
I burned my tongue.
Are you done?
I want to get married.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It never should have happened.
Turn to the right.
I haven't forgotten it.
"Are you a teacher?" "Yes, I am."
Better ever than never.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A hamless sandwich is not a sandwich.
What have you done to me?
The Golden Key opens everything.
When is your birthday?
>>srp_Cyrl<< The house is built of brick.
My name is Jack.
She has Ukrainian citizenship.
Better by grace than by force.
Maybe they need some money.
Tom is outstanding.
I went into her room.
All or nothing.
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Vladivostok is a city in Russia.
I tried to be kind.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He started roaring.
She's usually late.
You're sad.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom went to the reunion last week.
Why would Tom want that?
I do.
What do you mean by that?
Do I demand too much?
He congratulated me on my success.
I'm still awake.
Everyone changes.
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
Thanks for the email!
Pick one.
You'll be completely safe.
I turned around.
Stay there.
Head or letter?
I wouldn't hurt you.
Are you a student?
I love watching you work.
Oh, my God!
I'm fine.
Do you want to hear the truth about this event?
What is your nationality?
Stand by.
I'm kidding.
Excuse me, do you speak English?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Keep moving quietly.
They were all young once.
Good-bye!
It didn't hurt.
Be yourself.
I have a grudge against Tom.
Don't yell at me.
You must be new here.
>>srp_Cyrl<< There was a heated argument.
How do you do?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Many great thinkers who were unknown during their lives became famous after death.
We're about a wolf, and a wolf's at the door.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She is a yoga instructor.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I'm okay.
I am not happy with this situation.
I was just thinking about you.
Sleeping on the carpet is great.
Why are you acting like this?
He married her for the money.
My parents died.
There are many secrets in life.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Give me the key, and I'll unlock the universe.
Where's your friend?
I hate mathematics.
I'm so excited.
I don't want meat.
Is there anyone in the house?
Everything's ready.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mom transplanted flowers into the garden.
I wouldn't hurt him.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Multiplying three by five gets fifteen.
I was angry.
How much time do I have left?
Keep trying.
>>srp_Cyrl<< San...I tried to explain to St. Peter, and I did it in German, because I didn't want to be too explicit.
You're sad.
Sure.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The older we get, the weaker our memory serves us.
Why me?
We barely survived.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Fate shuffles the cards, and we play.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't monkey around!
A gluten-free diet is the most effective treatment for celiac disease.
Start counting.
Eat slowly.
>>srp_Cyrl<< They decided to take it.
What is your Bosnian name?
This will take forever.
I bought a book.
Why are you giving it to me now?
That's all for today.
I called him.
Tom unlocked the door.
He's not honest at all.
Why didn't you say so?
You're sad.
Everybody's lying.
Is he a teacher?
The first step is the hardest.
Stop moving!
How do we know he is innocent?
Have you ever tried it?
Dogs bark.
She came alone.
Where is the museum?
Why is love so complicated?
>>srp_Cyrl<< Sami lacks some board in his head.
Am I wrong?
You need a hobby.
>>srp_Cyrl<< At the next intersection turn right.
I told you it didn't work.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You too, Brutus?
>>srp_Cyrl<< I often borrow books from Tom.
I don't know what that is.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I got off at the wrong bus stop.
The world is unfair.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He started yelling.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't be rude to me!
She drinks like a fish.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom named his hamster Cookie.
He is a man of experience.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is deaf as a cannon.
Your house is big.
I want to get married.
It was love at first sight.
I mean, I am.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Don't strain yourself!
This is pure escapism.
You're sad.
Welcome back.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Redheads are driving me crazy!
>>srp_Cyrl<< Emma was very conspicuous at the party.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Call security!
What do you believe?
Tom took the Russian sentence.
Tom shrugged his shoulders.
I'm very impressed.
I should talk to my father about it.
We're the same soy.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You have to stop smoking.
You better shut up!
The baby is asleep.
He's not a kid anymore.
We're almost done.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She released the bird from the cage.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
You are my happiness.
Thank you so much for everything!
He's good.
Did you know that?
Are you ready?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He's my rival in business.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Now present yourself using these Sentences!
My name isn't "you"; it's Ricardo.
I hope this never happens again.
It is very likely that it will rain tomorrow.
You're driving me crazy.
I remember everything.
It doesn't matter where I am.
Open up!
I'm deaf and dumb when I eat.
Who are you?
No need for words.
I don't understand this word.
>>srp_Cyrl<< As long as a man lives, he hopes.
What's his job?
Tom's selling cars.
I'm sick of your whining.
I'm too old for something like this.
>>srp_Cyrl<< I've lost the flow of thought.
It's no big deal.
Can I kiss you?
My name is Ricardo. What's your name?
Can you repeat that?
Feels good.
Speak clearly.
I've never seen a red refrigerator.
I'm so sorry, Tom.
That's enough for today.
I don't see the difference.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Mosquitoes in Minnesota are as big as storks.
I almost forgot my passport.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You never get there on time.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Exactly when did you do it?
Please add me to Facebook.
It's empty.
We're going to lunch at 1 o'clock, or 10 minutes.
Give me the milk.
At this stage of world history, in America there is not one such thing as an independent press. You know that and I know that. Among you there is not one less than one who dares to write his honest opinion, and if you wrote it, you would already know in advance that it will never appear in the press. I have been getting my salary regularly to keep my honest opinion out of the newspaper that I am working for, many of you would also be similarly paid for similar things to the street.
Do you think it's worth saving these letters?
How long have you been here?
That's a bad sign.
Don't argue with me!
He doesn't want to lose a whole week.
Tom's car has a hundred horsepower.
Tell me a story from beginning to end.
Do you like apples?
Stop moving!
Do you hear anything?

What are you talking about?
What did you do today?
Be patient.
You are the great love of my life.
It's dark.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The house is made of brick.
Like father, like son.
Anyone can do that?
Sign here.
It is said that a doctor should only help nature.
I want to show you something.
We haven't met yet.
Make yourself at home.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom works for his father's company.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You never wanted to live on an island?
I don't want you to get hurt.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He was killed on the spot.
They're digging a hole.
Turn left.
Just like the good old days.
I need something to drink.
That was good.
These are very old books.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It's a time contest.
Please go.
You don't know me.
It's not that easy.
Happy birthday!
I got off the train.
They won.
Tom's gone.
Are you on Facebook?
How about you?
>>srp_Cyrl<< It all played out at lightning speed.
It's hers, isn't it?
Mini skirts are back in fashion.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Can you go any faster?
I am a translator.
My father always said that heaven helps those who help themselves.
Be realistic!
I had lunch with her.
It's their book.
You'll be completely safe.
It's snowing.
I'm worried about you.
She came alone.
Make love, not war.
Does Tom eat eggs?
Turn left.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Are you being honest, Ken?
Can you cook?
I'm just doing my duty.
Good luck with the exam!
I saw a cat.

We'll win.
You underestimate me.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Could you translate this for me?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He gave up.
Do you agree with that?
Go on!
Wang Lao Qi is not beer.
How much does this hat cost?
Where is the museum?
Are you coming with us?

How about you?

>>srp_Cyrl<< I completely disagree with that.
He's crazy as hell.
>>srp_Cyrl<< May I take your dictionary?
I wanted to help you.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
What about you?
I'm not losing hope.
I want to see you behind bars.
Look around.
All rights reserved.
My French sucks.
I participated in the contest.
Good to see you again.
>>srp_Cyrl<< She cooks his meals.
You don't have a wife, do you?
Last week we cut down all the trees in the yard.
She opened the door.
Be patient.
I want to be with him.
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
>>srp_Cyrl<< He kicked the ball in the goal!
>>srp_Cyrl<< The expensive porcelain broke into paramparchads.

Good-bye!
I'm angry.
Follow him.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Some people no matter what age they are at, don't lose their beauty.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The elephant has a long nose.
Keep the change.
I like to study foreign languages.
Let me sit down.
The language of Europe is translation.
>>srp_Cyrl<< The mayor personally presented the awards.
I would do the same thing again without thinking.
The code is Muriel.
Don't argue with me.
He is a full monarch.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He likes to make a donkey out of a mosquito.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He never got over the death of his son.
I can do it with my eyes closed.
She has to buy her son a new bike.
My dear, don't be shy!
I don't know the answer.
The cat is not human.
So this is how it ends?
What's this?
Turn around.
Just close your eyes.

Tell him.
Do you want to learn something specific?
We'll have to walk now.
>>srp_Cyrl<< A girl named Pizza and Mr. Mash were walking in the woods.
Either way, you're wrong.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Redheads are driving me crazy!
A man has a lot of desires that he does not even want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite.He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment for him.Such a desire is also a desire for eternal life. Had it been fulfilled, one would have become completely sick of infinite life, and would have wanted death.
She put her fingers on the table.
The first step is always the hardest.
We're Australians.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Greeks also often eat fish.

Is breakfast included in the price?
YouTube videos are meaningless.
I was just thinking about you.
In the beginning, God created heaven and earth.
>>srp_Cyrl<< He raised the trophy high.
A hungry man is an angry man.
A woman eats bread.
He has two cars.
Words are not needed.
French is a difficult language.

Don't get caught.
Forget it!
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
We're from France.
No one is immortal.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Anna is interested in computers.
It must have been hard for you.
What's the weather like today?
>>srp_Cyrl<< We rose at dawn.
Tom will buy a new computer.
At first glance, it looks easy.
I called him.
I'm in Rome.
>>srp_Cyrl<< You'll never catch me alive!
Neither can I.
You don't even know his name, do you?
The bullet went through his body.
They know you.
Are you sure?
Do you have a passport?
My brother's not home.

I'll be late.
I didn't vote for Tom.
You need money.
You're the boss.
Someone's here.
I guess we'll never see each other again.
I watched Tom die.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Have you ever seen anything like this?
That's life!
I've been looking for you.
Money is not a measure of success.
The rest is irrelevant.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Do I smell sarcasm?
Let me check.
Do you play any sports?
Are you okay?
I'm waiting for the bus.
Please, go on.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Tom is seen.
>>srp_Cyrl<< Why did you shave your beard?
Trains in Serbia are very slow.
This road leads to the city.
Your time will come soon.
What's this about?
We're close friends.
You can go to sleep now.
>>srp_Cyrl<< It turns out to be true.
I don't know the answer.
Let's start right now.
Who is your teacher?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Everybody's watching the World Cup.
What is your blood type?
Keep trying.
