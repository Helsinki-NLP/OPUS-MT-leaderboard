Welsh MPs are worried that "they will look like Muppets"
Some MPs (Assembly Memord, AM) were amazed to hear the proposal that they might be referred to as representatives of the Welsh Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans to rename the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Parliamentary MPs from all political spectrum are concerned that they may become a laughing stock.
A Labour party MP said his group is concerned that the name "relieves with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp shit.
Parliamentary MP from the Wales Party (Welsh. Plaid Cymru) said the group as a whole "is not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open" for a change of name, but that the MWP can quickly be converted into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the pronunciation "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently preparing the law for the introduction of a change of name, announced: "Of course the final decision on how the MPs will be knighted on their own."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that met broad support for changing the name of parliament's parliament.
When it comes to what will be called MPs, the Committee was prone to the term "members of the Welsh Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
Parliamentary MPs propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring headaches to Parliament Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a change law within weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the Parliament operates, including rules on disqualification of MPs and establishing a committee system.
During the debate on the law, MPs will have a decisive vote on what they want to be called.
Macedonians to referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a property of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the initiation of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of plebiscite's name change, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
But referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is a simple price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have gone silent as Harlem churches fight for survival
"The older people I spoke to said that in the past there could be a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there is neither."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are socializing in a different way today," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighbourhood where people stay regularly."
When it comes to churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and "earlier or later it will be found again at the beginning."
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people would live who would not help the remaining churches in the neighbourhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore the day will come faster when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that held the services nearby took possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or improving blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but with Reverend Johnson's parishioners planning to rebuild it, ordering a series of bells, so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir at St. Martin's, proudly called Carillon "the bells of poor people".
An expert who played on carillon in July used the second term: "cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who has played at a larger carillon in Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What takes place in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors of construction works, some of which were brought by laymen of the church and other Episcopal children.
Cristia, the parish manager's body composed of laymen, wrote to the children in July because of concerns that the child would "try to move the costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not included in the involvement of architects and contractors sent by the child.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the side of the boy.
A shark injured a 13-year-old while diving for lobsters in California
According to an official statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the opening of lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry for help, and then he paddled with the group to the scene of the attack to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was the excitement of the lobster being caught, but then he realized he was yelling, "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he got close to the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone was torn.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: "There is a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the child's Rady Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach at 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas to conduct investigations and safety of swimmers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s becomes competition with chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic counters in the style of department stores and by hiring specialized sellers.
As part of the large entry into the UK beauty market worth 2.8 billion. GBP, which continues to grow in parallel to the drop in sales on the home clothing and equipment market, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if proven successful.
Investment in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets try to use the space on shelves that used to be provided for TVs, microwave ovens and home equipment.
Representatives of Sainsbury’s stated that it would double the size of the cosmetic products on 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, Maybeline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores such as Boots.
Supermarket also restarts its range of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, perfume merchant Fragrance Shop will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first to be opened in Croydon last week in southern London and the second to be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Network purchase and return to daily purchase of small quantities of food in local grocery stores means supermarkets must try harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, director-general of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets will look more and more like department stores while the supermarket chain is trying to resist favourable trades such as Aldi and Lidl offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s introduced Argos in hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments, because he bought both chains two years ago, which claimed to have prompted the sale of foods and made these acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to refresh its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended with a dispute over the division of the pharmacy’s income in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical business to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain three years ago.
He claims that Lloyds will play a part in the plan by incorporating a range of luxury skin care products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks commercial director Sainsbury’s stated: “We changed the look and impression of our cosmetics departments to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invested in special training of colleagues who will be at hand to customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby gave up an 11 million-pound contract.
Dragon’s Dan Peter Jones star left to "buy with rage" after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up her 11 million-pound contract with his brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV stores chain
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of house clothes and fashion accessories Truly.
Their brand was compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The host of This Morning (37) on Instagram announced she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left a Dragon’s Dan Peter Jones star to cook with rage by withdrawing from a joint profitable business at the last minute to focus on her own shiny new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim that Jones was "mad" when the golden girl television during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds meant that there was no time to devote to their brand of house clothes and fashion accessories Truly.
This job was compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and was to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "Truly was one of Holly's biggest priorities.
This was to be a long-term investment in the future that would ensure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was a shock to everyone involved in the job.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to starting the whole line.
There's a lot of goods at Marlowe's headquarters that's ready to sell."
Experts believe that due to the departure of the host of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes and possible additional delay of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-time friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were ten years close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as CEO in March.
Couples spend vacations together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV show I’m a celebrity.
A source close to Jones last night said "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Heavy negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the paper over comments that some might consider "unworthy of the president" and because he has such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
"Why has President Trump made so many concessions?"
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
"I have made no concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation talks are stuck.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the north did not notice the "appropriate response" of the United States to the activities of disarming North Korea.
He noted that instead, the United States still did not abolish sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stand in his speech at the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were threatened by war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – stopping missile test launches, helping free hostages and bringing the remaining American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of standing in front of this crowded arena waiting for 10,000 people to enter, we would have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing at a bunch of people directly ahead.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a precondition for using international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not asking for international help, so it is all a bit of a problem," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Palo, it is still uncertain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Office, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to engage in efforts to provide assistance.
Given the continuing tremors in Indonesia, the country remains sadly unprepared for dealing with the wrath of nature.
Although shelters in the case of tsunamis were built in Aceh, this is not something that is common on other parts of the coastal line.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best of times, traveling between a number of Indonesian islands isn't easy.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
The boat hospital that was anchored in Lobok to handle earthquake victims is on its way to Palo, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
Improvement of the Indonesian decayed structure was the basis of President Yoko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Yokoa is struggling with a lack of funding, and there are new elections next year.
Yoko also faces pressure from remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battle on the streets of machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Look: Liverpool Player Daniel Sturridge scored a tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday from losing the Premier League game against Chelsea at the 89th minute Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal score of 1:0 to Chelsea.
He moved the ball to his left leg before kicking it to the other post.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the right top corner of the net.
In the end, the ball escaped from Cappay Arrizabalagai who jumped towards her and entered the net.
"It was difficult to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn't think about it too much and I just shot."
Chelsea ran at halftime at 1:0 after the hit of Belgian star Eden Hazard at 25 minutes.
The Blue Attacker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic during that game before he turned somewhere in the middle of the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick pass in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the ball with his left foot into the net on the other side of Liverpool goalie Alisson Becker.
Liverpool is playing a game of club competition against Napoli in the 15th Champions League on Wednesday at Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton to the UEFA European League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami grew to 832
The death toll in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the state disaster office announced early Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told reporters at a press conference that a large number of people were reported trapped in the ruins of buildings following a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that felt on Friday and caused waves of height up to 6 metres.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of remains of broken buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after a female body was discovered at Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old girl was found at 7:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called in people from the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to speak to us, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite all, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to address us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was Birkenhead's resident and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know this woman arrived to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and police said the process of informing the victim's next of kin is under way.
A taxi driver living on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The tenants are now told that it will take several hours until they can return to their homes.
Apparently, a police officer told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up at a crime scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's so terrible."
At 14:00 in the fenced area there were two police vans, and another one was parked just outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and monitored the apartment block.
Of all those with any information was asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, they call 101 or anonymously address the Crimestoppers organization at 0800 555 111, referring to the record 247 of September 30th.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament is the latest monument in the midst of a debate on "the end of history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for the almost Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical puritanic followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt "stupid" and "trying to change history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s society, said: “In the debate currently in connection with the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of Westminster Palace would become subject to debate.
Iconoclasm of English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The wonderful revival of Cromwell, Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is proof of the 19th century thinking and part of the history of a person whom many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than by today, a defender of parliament from external pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely credible opinion is subject to a historic debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of Lord Protector are still worth honoring and marking."
The killer pig killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, pigs attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead with severed arteries and covered in blood near a stop in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, announced the Jutarnji list of southern China on Sunday.
The pig farmer prepared to vaccinate pigs in the piglet on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
Apparently, on Wednesday, he arrived with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door to the neighbor's pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a 200-pound pig bit a grower to death.
Evening news Guiyang states that a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated."
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 0440 Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Vecernje Novosti that the pig is locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while police are gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market management are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely occurs, swine attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her wife at their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 200 - pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer against a tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They are only playful.
They nibble, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to be shown respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa weakens as she crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But during the following days, Rosa will bring flooding rains in the northern Mexico and southwest of the United States.
At 0500 Eastern weather, Rosa blew at 140 km/h, making it a category 1 hurricane, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific it creates a low pressure area and moves towards the West Bank of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to suppress a deep layer of tropical moisture in the direction north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture interacting with the approaching low pressure area will cause heavy rainfalls in much of the southwest.
In the local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, muddy floods, and possible landslides in the desert.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause precipitation that will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 25 to 100mm rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
In no way is going to the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and thunder showers will bring local storm winds and dust screws.
Approaching the low pressure area will bring local heavy rains to parts of the southern California coast.
There may be rainfalls in the amount of more than 12 mm, which may cause less muddy streams and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainfall in the wet season in this region.
The scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning before covering the wider area at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread Tuesday to the area where the borders of the federal states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are being touched on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes are possible across the United States as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at small distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central United States.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days the residual summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
In most Central and Eastern United States, the beginning of October is expected to be warm from 27 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high possibility of above average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched six television networks on Thursday tense testimony of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the '80s.
Meanwhile, a political shootout continued, and reporters were interrupting a regular programme to notify the last minute of Friday's turn: a deal reached by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate court that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at the high school party.
Kavanaugh said in keen testimony that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
Friday's hearing was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number listed in Nielsen's report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers for other networks that carried the hearing was not immediately available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people who look at the content in the offices.
In order to give you a better picture, it's an audience similar to the one watching football playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained great even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's play.
After that moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught demonstrators yelling at him as he tried to take the elevator to a hearing by the Judiciary Committee.
For a few minutes, he was standing there looking down as CNN's live camera showed demonstrators throwing insults at him.
"I stand here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office made a statement and before the elevator doors closed, he'd say more at the board hearing.
Hours later, all cable and television networks monitored live when the Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to vote throughout the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do it on condition that the FBI investigates the charges against the candidates over the next week, as required by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh indictment.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times Prime Minister Theresa May, she accused critics of leaving the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in another interview in the same edition with her on the cover, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other customs duties "total stupidity".
Wayde Sims' murder: police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayne Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and detained on charges of manslaughter, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports WAFB, CBS branch office.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
Bail is requested at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge M.E.'s office released a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police administration thanks the task force for fugitives of the Louisiana state police, the federal police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for their assistance in an investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for "persistence and search for truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
A lap dancer, 6'2", grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "difficulty" and "shocked" over Wayde's death.
"This is what we always worry about," Wade said.
Volcano dumps ash on Mexico City
Ashes that ejected the Popocatapetl volcano reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center was following multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in Mexico City districts such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increased activity of a volcano located 72km southeast of the capital since 2017 the earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook central Mexico.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash against independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrators advocating independence clashed with the riot police and after thousands joined anti-demonstrations to mark the Catalan polarizing secession vote.
A group of masked separatists who got in the way of the riot police began throwing eggs and powdered paint at police officers, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fights broke out later in the day when the police used the clubs to calm the fight.
During a few hours of groups advocating independence, they chanted "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness", and opposite them the Unionists shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local press said.
The tensions in the independence-seeking region did not resolve even a year after the October 1st referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, and which the Catalans celebrate.
A large majority of voters opted for independence even though turnout was small because those who had boycotted the vote mostly against secession.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in heated conflicts last year after police tried to stop the vote from being held in voting stations across the region.
Groups advocating independence spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but demonstrators were forced to take another route.
Narcisse Termes (68), an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a key, though a narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have been struggling to maintain momentum this year because their most famous leaders are in a self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict prompted politicians both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who announced to the investigative prison since the end of last year that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidating for European elections is the best way to announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving a car into the house
Three men 33, 34, and 39 years of age were arrested after driving multiple times into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7:30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the yard door was damaged and the building itself.
It's possible that at some point a crossbow arrow was fired at the car.
Bingo Menge brought Livingston a victory over the Rangers with a score of 1:0.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won.
The new Scottish Premiership League Club Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his second defeat of 18 games led by the Ibrox Stadium Club.
Dolly Menge's hit proved decisive as Gary Holt's team lined up with the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team is still without winning the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they're playing Hearts, the leading league club behind eight points.
Before that, the European League Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna Club on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt still hasn't had a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead even before they scored that shot, given that their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made it through, but he was too slow on his way to goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only wide-open the ball after slipping to intercept Craig Halkett's head towards the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble for the guests.
And that's exactly how a key goal was scored.
The Rangers failed to stop the free kick, and Livingston designed the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisting Mengi together who hit the middle of the goal.
Up until that point, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but they faced impenetrable domestic defense, so goalie Liam Kelly mostly had no business.
It continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the blow.
Ranger Allan McGregor's goalie's legs got in the way of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow has struck a wide blow from another organised attack by Livingston.
Long passes failed to cross the Livingston goal line, and two elevenths were not given – after Halquette's conflict with the replacement player Glen Middleton and one to play with his hand.
"Great" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdar Lamont of the Scottish BBC in the Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent game and the result of Livingston.
All of them were excellent, thus continuing to exceed expectations on that entry route.
Their game style and staff have barely changed since their return to the big clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he has united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at leading an excellently organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worral from taking a break throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards they set for a good game under Gerrard.
They couldn't get the ball to the end. They only opened a hole in the home team once and it's kind of an invitation to pull out for the Rangers who are in the middle of the charts.
Erdogan greeted with mixed feelings in Koelno
On Saturday (September 29th) everything was full of smiles under the clear sky when the leader of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- aimed at improving relations between NATO's allies.
They differed in opinions on issues involving human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Koeln to open a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population outside Turkey lives in the city.
For security reasons, police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but a large number of the president's supporters showed up to see him.
And hundreds of opponents of Erdogan -- a large number of Kurds -- have raised their voice by condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him with welcome in the country.
Conflicting demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor celebrated by some German Turks as a hero, while others attack as an autocrat.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist fatal in car collision
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn, on a road with heavy traffic in Deptford, southeast of the city about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the man died instantly.
The crash occurred several months after another cyclist was killed after the crash and the getaway of the driver from the Chiders Street accident, about a mile from Saturday’s crash site.
City police said police officers are trying to identify the man and inform his next of kin.
Due to the accident, the roads were closed and bus traffic was rerouted, and motor vehicles were recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six police officers injured in riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in riots in a male prison.
The riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and still last.
Special Tornado units have been brought in to combat riots involving eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Police officers were assisted on the spot because of minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "A specially trained prison staff has been hired to resolve the incident in progress at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received assistance from injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to make it clear that all the responsible will be committed to the police and that they may spend much time behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison warden ended up in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the riot police were called to prison to resolve a serious situation in which the staff were attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (possibly benefit for dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa passes through the Desert Southwest with its remaining strength and brings the danger of floods.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings about floods Monday and Tuesday in the area from Western Arizona, via southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa's supposed to get close to Phoenix late Monday with the rain and walk right over it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix stated in its tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Centre for Hurricanes predicts 50 to 100 mm precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 150 mm on the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest including the Rock and the Large Pool there is a probability of precipitation from 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total amounts of up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of floods, Rosa could come to her rescue because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a great danger, some of these rainfalls may be useful because there is a drought in the southwest.
"According to the US map of dry areas, a little over 40 per cent of Arizona is affected by at least extreme drought, the second highest category," Weather.com announced.
The hurricane's path first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 20 km per hour.
The storm came upon the colder waters of the Pacific and therefore weakened.
Thus, on Monday afternoon or evening, the coast of Mexico is expected to approach with the power of a tropical storm.
The rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to the northwest Sonora is from 75mm to 150mm, possible maximum 250mmm," the Weather.com announced.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass across Arizona and South Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is very severe rains on the Baja California peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the American Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Centre said.
These rains are expected to cause life - threatening floods and floods of mud in the deserts and landslides on the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
Around 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton was found an injured teenager.
He's been taken to the hospital and he's in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset Police Department announced that 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Police officers have called in everyone who has a recording of the event.
Trump claims Kavanaugh suffered the malice and rage of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a presidential rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered malice and anger" by the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress and firmly and emotionally rejected the charges of Christine Blasey Ford for sexual assault dozens of years ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing about the charges she made.
On Saturday, the president said that "the American people saw brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service," he told the crowd supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the importance of the Republican vote in half of the presidential term.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I actually am," he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claimed the democratic mission was "to create resistance and obstruction".
A republican leadership assistant told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of which were dragged away by huge waves that hit the coast when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves of up to sixm high hit the coast at dusk, dragging many of them to their deaths and tearing everything down in their path.
Tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run right away and got killed," said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Agency for Relieving the Consequences of the BNPB Disaster at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everyone on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at 800km/h before it hit the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape tsunamis and survived," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photos published by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) announced in its statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday corresponded to the two hundredfold power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the power of tsunamis.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were demolished.
He also said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of victims and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications have been completely interrupted and we have no information from Donggal."
"There are more than 300,000 people living in this area," the Red Cross statement added, adding that staff and volunteers were headed to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not providing information that the tsunami had hit Pala, although officials claim the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social networks, it can be heard that a man on the top floor of a building panicfully warns people down the street about an upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall fell ashore, carrying buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recording.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused the blackout of communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the military authorities, they started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still need food and other essentials.
The city airport has been reopened for humanitarian activities only and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widowo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Donggala successfully arrived in the town of Palu where employees were removed to Tarpaulin tents placed in the courtyard of their office, they forwarded the destruction scenes on the road," Doseb said.
"They told me they saw numerous destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have started wheels of aid in disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have been prevented from coming to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supply and personnel from other countries can only be started if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says “All right, it is a national disaster” we can receive international assistance, but such a situation has not yet been declared.”
When the second night of earthquakes and tsunamis fell at Palo on Friday, friends and families of those still considered missing still hoped that their loved ones would be one of those wonders that alleviate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewers.
On Saturday, the saviors freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian state paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
"In view of the many years spent paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, which had spread through the Paraglider community, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the competitions from Palu who participated at the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray handle, instead of two blue handles.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves took 26,750 American dollars while charging ATMs in downtown Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee who was filling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport Police Department.
Detective Dennis McCarthy's statement said the car driver was emptying an ATM in an amusement complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While busy, another man “went behind Brink’s back into the race” and stole a bag of money that needed to be put in an ATM.
Witnesses observed several suspects fleeing the scene of the theft, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: raper changes name to Ye
Raper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
On Saturday's Twitter announcement, he wrote the following: "A living being known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been known as Ye for some time and has used it as the title of its eighth album published in June.
The change comes ahead of his performance in the Saturday Night Live show, which is expected to launch its new album Yandhi.
The show's authors said he replaced singer Ariana Grande for "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe that “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible this means “tiʹ””, West said earlier this year in a discussion on the title of his album with Radio Manager Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It started with Kanya, which means "only", in just Ye – it's a reflection of the good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's the one in a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former associate, JAY-Z, toyed with versions of his name without a dash and a dash and written in capital letters.
Mexican AMLO Promises Not to Use Army Against Citizens
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador is in Tlatellolco Square on Saturday promised that "he will never use the army against the Mexican people."
Military troops fired during peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968 and killed as many as 300 people at the time the leftist student movements began to spread through Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those studying and opening a large number of free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education could attract young criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it invests in research in the area," said an investor in artificial intelligence and an expert in the Kai Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment came after various parts of the US government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the US generally lacks a formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first AI innovation country by 2030.
"Double increase in the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start since all other countries are far behind the United States and are looking for the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"A double increase in investment could double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the US," Lee said in a CNBC interview this week.
Lee, whose book: "AI superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player of Othello, and later served as director in Microsoft's research department and president of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee praised the previous technological competitions of the US government, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked the question when the following would take place to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It is not China that takes away academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on artificial intelligence research over the last few years.
Lee said changes in immigration policies could also help the US to encourage its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that Ph.D.s in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council published the next generation's Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to persons in academic institutions similar to that of the National Foundation for Science and other state organisations providing funding to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Defence Ministry established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to include partners from the activities and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment worth $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in research on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that wanted to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
On Saturday, Macedonian citizens voted on whether they wanted to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve the dispute with Greece that has been going on for several decades and has blocked Greece's opening negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece argues that the name of its northern neighbour is the property of its territory and vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim the change would undermine Macedonia's majority Slavic population's ethnic identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycotting campaign has cast doubts as to whether turnout will meet the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you up for NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of a deal with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries after the breakup of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgievska (79) said in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities were reported by 13 hours.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, joined a referendum in Strumica on 30 September 2018 to change the country's name, which would pave the way for joining the NATO Alliance and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and grabbed chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us under the name Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring so much needed investment to Macedonia, a country where unemployment exceeds 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "positive" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will join the referendum, below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian Thelma TV, showed that 57 per cent of respondents intend to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would support the referendum.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would have been the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes through the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense in Manchester on Saturday and won by 2-0.
Aguero made victory insanely simple, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentinean assailant received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He made it through three of Brighton's defense players and then made it to open ground.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposing players in green shirts.
He bypassed one of the defenders, and then he beat a few more of them to the edge of Brighton's space.
That's when he passed the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English assailant returned the ball to Aguer from his first attempt, who threw his right boot ball into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton's doorman, Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some foot problems," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola reported to reporters.
"We planned to play some 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues a head start in the Premier League.
That hit was reached in 29 minutes.
Aguero got deep on Brighton's turf during that game.
He beautifully passed the ball to Leroy Sane along the left flank.
Sanne pushed the ball several times before he led Sterling to the post.
Sky Blues' attacker threw the ball into the net just before he skidded into the outboard.

Scherzer wants to disable the advance of the Rockies.
Since Nationals players were eliminated from the playoffs, there was little reason to insist on a new start.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes for Sunday's victory against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, make the playoffs.
On Friday night, the Rockies won 5-2 over the Nationals at least secured a spot in the wild-card playoffs, but they still hope to win their first title.
"Even though we play for nothing, we can at least throw knowing what the atmosphere here in Denver is like with a bunch of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would witness this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce the Sunday starter, but in that case they're supposedly inclined to offer Scherzer a game.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitchers' area on Thursday and will play on Sunday when he usually rests.
In this season, Washington's right-winger achieved a score of 18-7, an average of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of Republican voters' turnout in the general elections, he commented on Brett Kavanaugh's choice for the Supreme Court judge.
"Everything we have done will be tested in November.
It's five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones – I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race, and that's why I'm everywhere, to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: "Look at this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
Their intention is to regain power in any way; you see wickedness, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control; therefore they want power and control; we will not give them."
Democrats, he says, have a mission to "rest and obstruct".
"You have seen this over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "mad, wicked, corrupt and lying".
He called Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, causing a loud disapproval of the audience.
"Do you remember her response?
Have you released the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document -- that was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer respects different opinions.
It does not tolerate the display of personal attitudes
I wasn't too surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour Party representatives who have been told they are not welcome – all because we have said what is on our mind.
According to my counsel, Joan Ryan acted similarly because she was determined to oppose anti-Semitism.
I was criticised in the censorship proposal for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with previous leadership.
The announcement on the Labour Party meeting of Nottingham East on Friday said that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I worked as a local representative of the Labour Party, the meetings of the main council on Friday nights were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, a lot of meetings today run in a different tone, and the promise of a "kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is estimated on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, since the associates I thought we shared similar political opinions from me began to demand a drastic change of opinion and take positions with which I would never otherwise agree – whether it was national security or a single EU market.
Whenever I turn to the public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there's a flood of offensive words on social networks calling for my recall, which they waive the Centre's policies and tell me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know I've had better luck than some of my colleagues, because the comments I've been given are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments daily, but they never fail.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me most is the tolerance of abusive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with each suggestion of distrust or change of election rules, we become increasingly narrow-minded.
Many times in the last two years have I been advised to bow my head, not to be so loud and tell me that everything will be all right."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, driven by the neglect of the Margaret Thatcher government, who left my school multipurpose classroom to decay, I wanted to provide better public services for those who needed them most – whether as a local councilor or cabinet minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East branch could have been misled in connection with my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is grabbing Brexit, which will have a negative impact on households, companies and public services, I don't understand the desire to lose time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But actually the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my electoral units, whether it's members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat by impeachment or political advantage will deter me from acting the way I think is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 Undefeated Ayr heading for the top
Two late attempts may have had some effect on the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day in Tennent's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the charts and are the only ones undefeated by ten teams.
Finally, the ultimate defense and better exploitation of opportunities led them to victory, and Coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be pleased.
"We have been tested at every game so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said, "Well done to Ayru, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did."
The attempt by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute by Frazier Climo led Ayr, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, enabled Melrose to gain results, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unrealistic attempt.
Climo increased Ayra's lead with elevenths before, at the very half of the time, he scored and achieved a solo attempt to change the Ayr score at 17:5 before the break.
But Melrose's second half began well and Patrick Anderson's attempt to achieve Baggot reduced the advantage to five points.
Then came a long pause due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott carried on a stretcher, and when the game continued, Ayr continued a good game by trying Stafford McDowall, who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again forced an extra player to pay, and by an unrealistic attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The lateral player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to bring down the Clima that had no ball; with the line for the penalty blow, MacPherson performed laying behind Ayra in full swing of penetration.
Climo realized that he did it almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe took a high blow from David Armstrong and sent a side player to Gregor Henry's fifth home team effort.
The star of the Still Game series seems ready for a new career in restaurant activities
Ford Kiernan, star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in service activities after being discovered to have been appointed director of the company of licensed restaurants.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in his favorite BBC series whose screenwriter is also one of the stars, along with a longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to be shown, and Kieran seems to be planning to devote his life to Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source for Scottish Sun suggested that Kieran wanted to engage in a "growing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will grant it a way out of the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a naval center full of cranes in La Paz.
There's an ocean-colored flag on public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are plowing the wing: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to return it."
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the lost seashore for Chile's sake during the conflicts due to resources in the 19th century is still alive – just as the longing for the re-sea voyages of the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia awaits a verdict by the International Court of Justice, expected on October 1st, after a five-year process, hopes may be at the highest level in decades.
"Bolivia has momentum, the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, optimisticly awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the International Court of Justice's verdict on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's view that after decades of demanding negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the surrender of a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Here comes Morales, the Bolivian charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from Monday's verdict.
"We are close to returning the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia's favour and that little would change if so.
The Dutch-based UN body has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the International Court of Justice ruling comes only six months after the final hearings, means the case "was not complex," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have set them back.
"The question of access to the sea has taken over the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric buried every good will of Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will continue dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
Those two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court has made an unusual decision quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an unusual opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's favorite presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclearly disarmed unless they could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep promises during the meeting of the leaders of these two rival countries in Singapore.
Comments were made at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, coming more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Una.
Ri says the sanctions continued because of "relaxed fantasies" and that the US's opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war would by no means bring the North to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete steps to disarm it first.
Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting at the top.
However, skepticism is widely present about Pyongyang’s serious intention to give up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the last line of large head covers is on their way to a luxury store in your neighborhood.
If you want to improve your hat collection or cover the sun completely, don't look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the runway presented a line of crazy giant headdresses for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and delighted the style lovers at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats swept Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their creations that draw attention to the runway.
The specimen that stood out was designed by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a broad feather-like edge that has quite "taken over" the head of the model.
Other bulky accessories included jewelry - decorated watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapples, but these supplements were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion pieces.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a snorkel and a mask, and the other one looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you follow the great fashion expression – happiness is on your side.
The stylists predict that huge hats could come into luxury stores in your neighborhood.
Huge hats fit perfectly with La Bomba heels, a straw hat with a perimeter about 60 cm wide, seen on many famous and famous persons, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the extremely impractical hat that conquered the social network on the runway sent another big creation – a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that wore it.
In the summer collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera for 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week, the orange bag of raffia, decorated with raffia and white leather lunch, was an exhibition item in the summer collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera.
Famous and famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores for next summer. Since the designer made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for big fashion accessories."
John Edward: Language skills that citizens of the world need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding exam results, and additional weight is given by individual and joint successes in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is trying to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the above-mentioned school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be the favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man who understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in your mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relations with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the highest grades in languages were obtained by independent school students.
A total of 68% of foreign students received excellent grades.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received an excellent grade for Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French-learning students and 63% of Spanish-learning students also received the highest possible score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and youth will surely need in the future.
Today languages as elective objects are considered as important as STEM items (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as in other places.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill jobs due to lack of labour with language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As more and more jobs demand language knowledge, these skills are key in the globalized world.
Regardless of career choice, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such long - term skills.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with strangers, and that gives them priority over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in 2013 involving more than 4,000 adults, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks the bidigital percentage of respondents, more specifically 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for children today.
If children learn more languages, especially languages from developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, every school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their program, while others will opt for languages considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom of 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are expert in this area.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment in which they will prepare and arm the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future has in store for us.
One cannot ignore the fact that today’s global business is very important for the future of each country, so it must also affect education.
Therefore, knowledge of modern languages should really be viewed as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer language selection, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Council of Scottish Independent Schools
LeBron will play first in Lakers jersey on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first performance for the Lakers from Los Angeles.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James is going to play the first preseason game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he still doesn't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training early this week James answered questions about his preseason plans for the Lakers, which consists of six games.
"At this stage of my career, I really don't need preseason games," he said.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel.
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign for numerous gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned gatherings Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet voted for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming elections because there is a risk that Republicans will lose the majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia start tonight, and how can you look at it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours Eastern Time, tonight, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's convention in West Virginia can be viewed online via live streams on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment this week on candidates for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh who have challenged controversy over the charges of sexual harassment.
But the primary goal of this series of gatherings is to help Republicans achieve an advantage for the November elections.
Therefore, from Trump's presidential campaign headquarters, they report that five conventions scheduled for next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
"Most in Congress is so important for the president's plans that he will travel to as many countries as we enter a tumultuous campaign," an anonymous spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Tonight's event to be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from "Ohi and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the past month. He won more than 40 points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must help him improve his ranking in the polls," University of West Virginia political scientist Simon Haedar told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018.: The United States team left their heart on the ground before individual clashes on Sunday.
After three one-sided couples' clashes on Sunday afternoon, maybe that's exactly what Ryder Cup was supposed to do.
“The wheel of happiness turns” is a saying that is particularly valid in sports and which athletes believe in, especially in competitions such as this.
Who's the wheel of fortune favored now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is currently on our side," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europeans are ahead with four points, while 12 points remain until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouragement from his pairing game with Justin Thomas, with whom three out of four points came after a day's play.
Spieth played deadlyly from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
Cheerleading exclamations grew louder and louder when Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, culminating in the key path to which Spieth came to an unsolved outcome.
After the road he won the game with 15 holes, there was a similar cheer roar in which hope and belief that Americans could turn everything around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
That's all those players have left now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the sensation of Ryder Cup.
The European strange, but irresistible couple have the maximum number of points and cannot be mistaken.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but he also dodged Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as a back line on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinari show that they are exactly the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the victory of the Europeans while the sun sets over the Paris Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time in different holes.
Still, it is too early to talk about the European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took down Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's couples game.
One Bogey and two double Bogeys on the first nine holes in the playground buried a Spaniard and a Swede in a hole from which they failed to dig.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help individuals dig out of their hole.
It's fascinating to watch couples' games up close because you can see the interaction of players in pairs, hear the advice they give and those they don't give, as well as study a strategy that can change in a moment.
Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary fighting, which some, especially the Stateside, suspected.
Europeans on the last day of Ryder Cup enter with a lead of 10-6
Europeans after Saturday's couples games on the last day of Ryder Cup enter with a significant advantage over the United States of 10 : 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods led with four points of difference at Le Golf National.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, in an effort to win the trophy that eluded her in Hazeltine two years ago, was superior to the American team in the morning games in pairs, achieving a score of 3: 1.
The American team showed greater fighting in pairs by winning two games, but the score difference was already high.
To win the trophy, Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team debutante to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Mollywood", after a sensational weekend only a second couple who won four points in pairs in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, they proved superior to the game against Woods and American debutante Bryson Dechambeau by winning 5&4.
Woods who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games made some ingenious moves, but now he has 19 losses of 29 games in fourballs and couples and seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning Fourballs to get Henry Stenson's partner back in the game with the couples and suffered a 2&1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But the Europeans did not have it all worked out as well during a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
The triple winner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, scored two points on Sunday, setting the scale high for their American team.
First they defeated Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter with a score of 2&1 in the fourballs, and then they defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after the first two holes were lost.
Twice in the history of Ryder Cupa, a team that was four points behind, managed to return in individual games, although Fury's team only needs an unsolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days behind, their Sunday counterattack seems to be difficult.
North Korea announces that "no way" for unilateral disarmament without trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that further sanctions increase distrust of the United States and there is no way that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill" last year, for example halted nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear testing station and decided to halt nuclear technology and weapons development.
"But we did not get a satisfactory reaction from the United States," he added.
"If we do not trust the United States, we do not have faith in our national security. Under such circumstances there is no way we will disarm ourselves first unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints against Washington's resistance to a "professional" approach to denuclearisation under which North Korea would gradually be abolished, its statement is significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim made a promise to work on the "denuklearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump assured the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has conditioned Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons before then.
Washington also ignored calls for a reduction in strict international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that denuclearisation be done before then and increases pressure by sanctioning its objective and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war", Ri added.
"Perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is only a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that continued sanctions increase distrust."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for Kim and Trump's second meeting that the President of the United States spoke of earlier this week in the United Nations.
But the minister noted that Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in held as many as three meetings in the last five months and added, "If the denuclearization had been sought by South Korea, not by the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have led to such a halt."
Regardless, the tone of Minister Rio's speech differed greatly from last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim a "man rocket" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump, who threatened to "complete destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim in the United Nations for his courage to disarm, but added that they had much work ahead of them and that sanctions had to remain in force until North Korea was denuclearised.
Trump said Wednesday that there is no time frame for denuclearisation and added, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have voiced a view that the UN Security Council should be rewarded with Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be strictly continued until complete, final and verified deuklearisation occurs."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt funding for a nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rio at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress was made, but after a few hours, North Korea called him out for "gangster demands".
North Korea has agreed to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and the nuclear complex that will be achieved if the United States takes "the appropriate measures".
He added that Kim revealed to him that these "suitable measures" refer to the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course in learning how to get a good rest
A new course at Harvard University allowed all students to get a good night’s sleep in an attempt to combat an increasingly widespread learning culture with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world's best university often have no idea about the basics of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of the science of sleeping at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, has devised a course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The idea of the course came after giving a speech about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did I find this out only now, at the last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," He told The Telegraph.
The first course this year explains to students how good sleeping habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
A professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and the head of health services at Paul Barreira University says the University decided to introduce a course after serious sleep deprivation was observed during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student dorm where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how the lack of sleep affects success and how important the sleeping routine is.
During the lecture, students also learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
After that, there is a map of the campus with interactive icons that encourage students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," Professor Czeisler added.
A culture of pride on all-night learning before exams continues to exist, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps to fight weight gain because sleep deprivation affects the brain, instills it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design a course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course to the entire campus.
As the next step, he plans to ask all graduates to complete a similar study item before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking up. They must be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light that broadcast electronic devices screens, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1: 0 Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's shot mowed down Steven Gerrard's faulty defense and ended the game by winning Livingston with a score of one to zero.
The team from Ibrox wanted to achieve their first victory after the February triumph and score 4-1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team now lags eight points in Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers seemed to be out of inspiration and didn't seem to even the score.
As the Rangers now hit sixth place, Livingston went up third with only one score behind the Hibernan.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after Line Judge Calum Spence sustained a head injury when an object was dumped from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the flanks and so pushed past Ayra to the Batfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same lineup of Livingston that took the Hearts' measure last week and would have been thrilled that his well-designed lineup had stifled any attempt by his opponent.
The Rangers may have had the ball more in their possession, but Livingston with her scored more.
They had the chance to score two minutes after Menga was first thrown out of the game, which opened up the space for Scott Pittman to head for Allan McGregor's goal, however, the docket missed the opportunity.
The deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass on the imprecise blow to the rear lines.
At one point, the Rangers took control, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the judge should have judged him eleven in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not accept the Colombian request.
In the first half, the Rangers were only able to point two balls at the goal, but former Ibrox doorman Liam Kelly's one blow to Lassana Coulibaly's head and a tame blow to Ovie Ejaria was not a big problem.
Although 34-minute playoffs in Livingston slowed the game, no one can deny them the effort.
The Rangers missed using Jacobs' deep ball again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his cool and chose Menga to simply end the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had the current effect because the winged player passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett took one long shot after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide sweep from the angle.
Ranger's replacement, Glenn Middleton, was looking for another late 11 because he tripped with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes this time.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger counter
And now here is the page from our Almanac in "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...the day of the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
The main stronghold of science from that time, Geiger's counter became the main stronghold of pop culture, for example in the 1950 movie "Bells of Colorado" in which seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the role:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Look at that, you can hear it!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” bad cells and destroy them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells as part of the treatment
The procedure includes extracting immune cell cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory
Cells are treated so that they can “recognise” the protein that is common to many types of cancer and then re-inject into the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify bad cells, ovarian cancer has resolved for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes extracting cells from the immune system from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory to know “recognise” protein called HER2 which is common to many types of cancer and re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 encourages the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting cells from the immune system from the patient and their “learning” how to recognise cancer cells was successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West took part in the discussion about Trump after his appearance on the Saturday Night Live show and supported it, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's Make America Great Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after the break-up performance where he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song of an evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Let's Make America Great Again", he continued to speak against the Democrats and reiterated that he supported Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they tell me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist."
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee on the claims of Christine Blasey Ford for sexual harassment.
Although it wasn't broadcast, a video of West's speech on social media was transmitted by comedian Chris Rock.
There's no telling if Rock was trying to mock West with an announcement.
Also, West complained to the audience that they were coming backstage to blame him for the hat he was wearing.
"They've been bothering me backstage.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I've been bullied!
They said I sank," Washington Examiner quoted me as saying.
West continued: "You want to see the bottom?", and said he would wear his Superman cape because that means I can't tell him what to do. You want the world to progress?
Try love."
Variety magazine wrote that his comments at least twice provoked the audience's displeasure, and members of the Saturday Night Live show seemed embarrassed, while one person said to the magazine, "The whole studio has gone silent."
West was called in last minute as a replacement singer for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days earlier.
By performing the song "I love it", dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, he stunned many.
Westa was supported by Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "One of the bravest people: Thank you for confronting the Mafia."
But show host Karen Hunter on Twitter announced that West simply "was himself and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts and expands the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper posted on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "will be officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the deceased musical legend Prince changed her name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.

The star of Kit Harrington's Game of Thrones has taken on toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of Jon Snow who wields the sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But a 31 - year - old actor has taken on the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they must be tough to gain respect.
Speaking for The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie of the Game of Thrones series, admitted that he wanted to "very decisively" face this problem.
"I personally feel very determined at the moment – where did we go wrong with manhood?" he asked.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, compared to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television, thanks to very masculine characters on screens, could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught through TV and on the streets, and that makes boys feel that they have to have these certain features of a man?
I think it's actually one of the great questions of our time -- how can we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not film the sequels of the Game of Thrones after its end next summer and said he had "done with battlefields and horses".
Since November Kit will perform in the new performance of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
An actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the shooting of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife by filming the show, which gave me a family and a future life," he discovered.
Rose in a fantastic series that won the Emmy Award played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/SIDA: China reports new cases of 14% disease
China announced that 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS increased.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases of infection have been transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was quickly transmitted across some parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
At a conference in Yunnan Province, Chinese health authorities said that HIV infected people are almost gone.
Each year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV virus through sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination by LGBT is said to be high.
Studies estimate that because of conservative values in the country 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of disease transfer in such relationships are due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of the effort to deal with the problem, the Chinese government pledged free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public staff has provided information on the GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, US representative Maxine Walters denied allegations that a member of her staff released the personal data of three Republican US senators on Wikipedia's website.
The Democratic Representative from Los Angeles assures that these claims are spread by individuals "the right wing's ultrasound", as well as websites.
"Lie, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual wrongdoing by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the releases of these data belongs to Councilwoman Waters' office, as well as information on the representative's staff member, the newspaper The Hill reported.
"These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations – is by no means responsible for the leak of that data.
These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Ms. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics online, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that Waters does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do can't be angry.
He mustn't be defiant.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to the criticism the Democrats were giving Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running against Waters in the general elections, also posted on Twitter.
"It is important if it is true," he wrote.
In her statement, Dr. Waters stated that her office had informed of these false claims "Measuring bodies and law enforcement bodies".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Review of the film “Johnny English: Again on Mission” – not interesting Rowan Atkinson fights spies
It is already common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems that in the new screening of the Johnny English action series, whose first sequel was “Johnny English” for the first time in 2003 and returned in 2011 to the big screens entitled “Johnny English Rides Again”.
Will the twisted own satire of how obviously worthless we are to become a new national export opportunity?
Johnny English, unable to see his eyes and rubber face again, has a permit for a more complicated situation, while his name tells him more than anything that it is a comedy creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a demented secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to "diluted" glamour, reminds Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of Mr Bean's character and somewhat reminds him of that guy who sang a note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
His character was also inspired by the traveler and mysterious world man Atkinson once played in now forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is the embodiment of chaos.
There are one or two good-looking moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and when the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually redundant, especially now when "serious" film titles such as "007" and "Missions Impossible" offer elements of comedy themselves.
Humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults. In my opinion, the wacky events of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent gags are embodied in Mr Bean's character.
The assumption that Great Britain is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
The hacker entered the most secret British spy web and discovered the identities of all British agents, the horror of an agent on duty, played by Kevin Eldon, in regrettably a brief appearance.
This overflowed a glass of the prime minister's patience, a arrogant and warlike figure experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because it was politically hated: Emma Thompson strives faithfully to paint a character that should represent Theresa May, but she did not get the material to do something with.
Intelligence consultants reveal to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be the careless Johnny English himself who is currently employed as the principal of a fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are several handsome gags here because English teaches rocker-style spying.
The English are quickly being brought to government premises for an emergency meeting, where they meet Bough again, his former partner and his eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an over-enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is mostly wasted.
And so, two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing everything completely wrong are returning to action and meeting the beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletova, who was embodied by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the vicious Jason Walta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous occasions: disguised as waiters set fire to a fancy French restaurant, causing a huge mess by smuggling on Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes complete anarchy by trying to use headphones for virtual reality to find out what the inside of Volta's house looks like.
Everything was done properly for this last sequel, but as attractive and showy as the film is, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
It's a pretty mediocre achievement.
And as with other Johnny English films, I wondered again, couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would suit his talent?
The Labour Party denies working on a plan for the British to work four days a week and get paid in five days.
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will discuss a radical plan under which the British would work four days a week and be paid for five days' work.
The party reportedly wants heads of workers to forward savings made by the AI and give them an extra day off.
That would mean employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could be "inclined" into the party's economic programme and plans for the country to bow to workers' interests.
The union congress backed the shift to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told the newspaper "The Sunday Times": "A policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"A four-day work week will not happen overnight, but it is a striving that fits the approach this party has towards balancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
The Labour Party, however, does not fully accept the aspirations.
Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
The Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to develop his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to take power from the hands of "faceless directors" and "profiters" in utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water economy companies may not be able to regain their entire bet because the Labour government could make "deductions" based on the observed irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in management committees of companies and to create inclusive equity funds in order to give 10% of private companies capital to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak for "60 Minutes" on whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court in at least a week and asked whether the agency's conclusion could affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes," Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would reveal something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after these allegations were made, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, unwavering, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, was carved in stone.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really need a strong accusation to change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett firmly denied everything," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons she named could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only star performances, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Power Project project, the international advocacy groups in hopes of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay the VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "shops" such as volunteering, sending emails to the world leader, telephone calls or any other meaningful means of raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful is Global Citizen, considering that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way of convincing people that they require an invitation to act, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" – where people feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters seeking to achieve a number of different objectives.
He claims the actions were an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to more than $37 billion that will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars were already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key obligations include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership between investors and enforcers in the United Kingdom that advocates "helping children develop to their full potential", with the promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from citizens of the world, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda with the aim of ending malnutrition in this area.
"With the help of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can achieve that the social injustice of malnutrition becomes only a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, the ambassador of the "The Power of Nutrition" Foundation, the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project "The Power of Nutrition" that will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on his website that reads: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen answers: “It will be a long and difficult journey □ we will sometimes experience failure.
But we will succeed, as well as great movements for civil rights and against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekda, Shawn Mendez, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe belong to some of the performances at this year's New York event that will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports to Ö Interior Minister
Washington can, "if necessary," use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, according to US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, the weekly Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russian engagement in Syria is especially where he acts on the call of a legitimate government □ excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in the area as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he says.
But in his view, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States with the help of the Navy can ensure the openness of maritime roads and blockade, if necessary, in order to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event hosted by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which in the US is represented as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they were actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said, and for Russia he said "used the same trick" in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
Statements were made simultaneously with the intention of Trump's administration to increase exports of its embedded natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project (North Stream 2), which, according to Trump, has made Berlin "a prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means to pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position sparked Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, says US Senator Massachusetts
US Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the mid-term elections.
During an immediate meeting with the citizens of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running herself.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which implies a woman at the helm," The Hill quoted her as saying.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president."
Warren expressed her opinion about President Donald Trump during a meeting with the citizens, saying "this country leads in the wrong direction".
"I am terribly worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In Friday's tweet, Warren says, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A poll Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's voters did not think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk/Boston Globe Centre for Political Research, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of the vote for potential candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats discussed in connection with a potential race for the president in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he goes through after he returns, is comparable with other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers return with," she told the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem about which both his son and other war veterans are silent and said they are "returning a little different, returning hardened, returning wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other military members, have given for this country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Administration.
18 federal states and D.C. support review of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts filed a friendly report in Washington on Friday to support a policy-disputed asylum seekers, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Freedoms Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which comes a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as countries facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States changed the decision of the Immigration Committee adopted in 2014, allowing immigrants who have no documents and fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that all asylum requirements be addressed based on specific facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such an obstacle violates that principle," the court's friend's report said.
Lawyers further argued that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering harms the US economy, arguing that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "safe the necessary workforce".
Chief State's Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion," the session said in its statement on June 11th.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all problems □ not even all serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusum's 35-year-old mother, while comforting her boy who was shaking in a fever at the evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palu.
"Emergency vehicles bring bodies every minute.
There's a shortage of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a seven-and-a-half-degree earthquake, were packed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors for sustained severe subsequent earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed inside the ruins of the wall," Haris said for Associated Press, and added that his family came to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Accusses China of "Maltretting" via "propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper issued a four-page ad in the US daily promoting the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of misuse of the US press for spreading propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid addition to the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6th US congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation of Beijing trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials described in a Reuters statement as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to post commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliations at the beginning of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in countries such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts say.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing has harmed US workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in Sunday's newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "is now doubling this harassment by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
"Through the expansion of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press putting a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the newspaper stand in Beijing you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people may have about the disturbing Chinese economic path because the media is under firm pressure from the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what newspaper it was.
Kavanaugh's debacle has been diverted by Republican voters before the mid-term elections, analysts warn
As many Republicans stand by Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and defend him on several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were very heated, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to vote.
Such things cannot be returned," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, said for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher has voiced doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's latest insistence on conducting an FBI investigation will be sufficient to reassure angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, and they won't forget tomorrow or November," the Washington newspaper, D.C., D.C., quoted Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group, as saying on Friday.
On Friday morning, protestors sang: "November is coming!", protesting in the Senate hall while Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee prepared to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news.
"People say they are already on a high level, which is true.
But they could also be taller, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they do not like the president, often do not go to the polls."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailed her allegations of sexual assault by candidates for the Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans continue to confirm.
"This is a real mess for the Big Old Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, NBC News quoted NBC.
"It is not only about voting on the board or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, but also about the way the Republicans approached all of this and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities organization, a group that helps in choosing Democrats, pointed out.
However, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided about who they will believe after witnessing Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more leaning towards him.
A new poll published by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations that Ford presented, along with at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet download for Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that develops on the basis of Berners-Lee's Open Solid Platform.
Solid allows users to choose a place to store their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do this now," he said, referring to the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal network data storage" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, obligations lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that the decision on who can access which information is completely user-friendly.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce's company, is that the company provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers.
Starting this week, developers from around the world could create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would turn overnight completely.
"We don't ask their permission."
In an announcement on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission was to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even as the Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of First World War Priest Victoria Cross
The celebration in honour of the only priest of the Church of England , who was awarded the Cross of Victoria as a fighter in the First World War , was organized in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, in an attack on Bellngleise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out he had received Britain's greatest military honor.
The memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "unbelievablely symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's venture for which he received this recognition.
According to an official London Gazette report, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the St Quentin channel "through a very dense fog and under heavy fire that came from the direction of the battlefield and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front lines and with "amazing courage" led the unit forward before he ran without any help to the Polish cannon and mowed down three military troops.
Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never achieve, and which provokes humility".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Piglet Peppa.
Imagine staying up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches in order to end up unable to monitor the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they were screened live on channel 5 at night.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in the UK remained in shock when the transmission was interrupted by Piglet Peppa.
Many were not impressed at all after staying awake until the early hours of the morning only because of the struggle.
One fan of terminating a children's cartoon on Twitter described it as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcast at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communications of Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Yuppie, Peppa's Pig."
Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would coordinate his schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I consider reruning, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But the transmission is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to realize anything until Sunday comes with us, when they'll have it on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was cut off, there were many correspondences that weren't even friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't.
I can promise you next time it won't come to that.
We're going to hold five fights instead of six, which we usually do, and we tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
It's unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior compared to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to become successful.
Twenty-four-year-old said that until he left for high school he was unaware that "not everyone is like me".
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he talks about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that winning the Olympics has been less important to him since he became a father.
The regular host of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
As an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" than the others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said: "To this day these feelings of inferiority and diversity were the right things that gave me power and strength so that I could succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that he was "somebody," so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
A double Olympic Olympic medalist became a prominent person who advocated LGBT and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he thought he was happy to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
The triple world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a male American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar, 20 years older than him last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you are so young,” he referred to his first Olympic games when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later □ said that it was difficult to find someone the same age and that he experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all the story would have been 'I have to win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand as he breathed out, and only when he stopped breathing and died, did I finally become aware that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"All I knew was that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life ; that I would jump in front of a domestic audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration for choosing the first song □ “Proud” by singer Heather Small Ö that echoed in it during the preparations for the Olympic Games and which always gives her chills .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on a bench at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to completely regain his form to avoid an awkward turning point.
Mickelson, who in this two-year competition has played record twelfth time, has been benched by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball games and four-ball games.
Instead of being at the center of action, as it often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and working out his game at the gym hoping to correct what was bothering him.
Never the most precise player, not even at the height of his career, is this 48-year-old not ready for the demanding Le Golf National field, where the long rough terrain routinely punishes impractical blows.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who won all four matches this week with new Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start the 12 individual games four points down, get to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said that he had confidence in his man and he couldn't say any more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of confidence."
He's famous and contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined there'd be more, but that's how it turned out, and we felt we should do it.
He wants to be in the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup that never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halftimes, even though Furyk said his presence brought some immaterial value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for it," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun with it this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup individual matches can easily be turned into an unpleasant race.
The Dane made his debut in the Valderrama match in 1997, where Captain Seve Ballesteros' team had an advantage of five points compared to the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow difference of 141⁄2 × 131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a close difference”, Bjorn said in the picture, after watching the 2018 team which won 5 ↔ 3 on Friday and yesterday led by a score of 10  ± 6 on the Le Golf National field.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you will play full force.
Get out in the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floors on the board are advertised.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
All I'm saying is, I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware of who stands opposite us the greatest players in the world."
Thrilled by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never run ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow we must face a different beast.
Tomorrow are the main individual performances, and that's something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're there as an individual, they're on the final exam of your golfer skills.
It's a message you have to pass on to the players, and she's that they have to do their best tomorrow.
Now leave your teammate because he has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with their teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of these major turns on the last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up a loser after Europe performed "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question that Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning, such as what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that rush goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on middle matches.
Accordingly, we organized our lineup and set up the boys as if we were going to, you know, try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys should go in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said about selected players for individual matches.
Germany's new warship put on hold again
The latest German Navy frigate was to be launched in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but it will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and cost increases, local media reported.
The launch of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of an ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuertemberg vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as it's known, they'll have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer period of maintenance RY should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to the parent ports.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships that are said to allow Germany to exercise power abroad □ by the time they enter the service will already become obsolete, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made all the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy's returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware shortcomings" that would make the warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wuertemberg class ships will be managed by crews of about 120 sailors ↔ half as much as the older Bremen frigates.
Also, the ship has been shown to be dramatically heavy, reducing its efficiency and limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is twice the weight of ships similar to those used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project ↔ including crew training α also becomes a problem.
It is said that the price has reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) ¥ compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates become particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Committee, acknowledged that the navy is actually "missing ships capable of deploying".
The official said the problem increased over time, as old ships were put out of commission and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of Baden-Württemberg's frigates could join the Navy.
The National Foundation listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on the estate in Scotland’s highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will follow ordinary and swampy dwarf bats, as well as brown long-lived and river bats in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile examinations using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of sound of all images will determine the frequency of bat voting and what kind it does.
Then a map of the habitat and the report will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the protection of the nature of NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of working on the management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction that affect shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose danger, as well as fliestraps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and pet cats attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threava estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten bats inhabit Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the perfect area for them.
"Here in Three we have a huge space for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitats.
However, there is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us to understand better what they need for progress."
It emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance works within buildings, since unintentional destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and youths, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and are illegal to kill, torture, or harass, or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative for the Scottish Bat Protection Association, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have much to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply don't know how their population is progressing."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges brought against him as "false news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who issued these charges.
Portugal and Juventus assailants were charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375 000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after filing charges, Ronaldo, 33, criticised allegations as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says the five-time Golden Ball winner in the camera.
"They want to be promoted using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and all is well," added the football player with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy doubts", Reuters says.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of violations, which is probably one of the most severe infringements of personal rights in the last few years."
It is said that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at a hotel and a Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99%" is a "good guy" failed by the "one percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they photographed her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "feared of retribution" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-four-year-old woman says she wants to call off the deal now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to the Italian giant Juve as part of a 100m-euro transition.
Brexit: UK will "repent forever" for losing car manufacturers
The UK will "repent forever" if after Brexit loses the status of the world leader in car production, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
A Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of waiting at the borders in the Brexit case could cause job losses without an agreement.
The Burnaston engine, produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis α, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"It is my view that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement, we will experience the delay of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers voiced fears of leaving the EU without agreement over possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer is the risks in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the "just in time" principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there could be a break at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota in its factory in Derbyshire could not keep more supplies than the ones needed in one day, they said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the "Chequers" plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We have to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will enable, as I say, not only maintaining the current success, but also taking this opportunity," BBC Radio 4 told today's programme.
"The evidence not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers shows that we absolutely must be able to continue this very successful series of supply chains."
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a member of the United Union, said his members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, after these jobs are gone, they never return.”
A government spokesman says: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy State's Attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week", as the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special attorney Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, ties between Trump's associates and Russia and possibly obstruction of justice by the president.
The question is whether Trump is going to fire the deputy state's attorney, and thereby endanger Mueller's independence, has been fuelling gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein discussing carrying a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refused these statements.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in the middle of an announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not like to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the FBI's lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not been set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would dispute the claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference at the White House since September 10th.
Head Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences is not a consequence of the repulsion of "theatrical behavior" by television reporters, although she said, "I will not oppose the fact that they are showing off."
Then she indicated that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is organising more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she added without stating evidence: "We have analyzed the figures."
Short addresses will continue to happen, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the question to the president of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to make this possible often, and you could see it in the last few weeks, and just that you can talk to the President of the United States will replace short addresses with journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of gathered journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers employed at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to the EU staff employed by the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and desire to stay even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to settle the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal, which are moving towards the expected decisions this fall.
But the United Kingdom government is also stepping up preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So now I would like to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's defeat from the Vanderbilt Commodores Club with a score of 31 ¢ 27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the line of the playground and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before they put him on the stretcher and sent him on further searches.
State University representative Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there were no "details about the type/range of injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing, plays first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five tackles before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help the homeless
The move will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the tax will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year for helping homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying real estate in the United Kingdom Ö and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be understood as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by promising to provide more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high salaries.
An increase in fees will be charged from individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to the government's efforts to fight homelessness.
Additional tax Ö which is added to the current fee, including an increase introduced two years ago to other homes and properties purchased for the purpose of publishing Ö may be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to raise 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built properties are bought by residents who have no residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the society of those who have their own home.
Many of the rich areas in the country – especially in the capital – have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
A new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in fees to help more young people reach their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not using the country, and urged Mrs. May to give up quotas on price-friendly properties to improve "an embarrassment due to the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced proposing a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and the end of unprovoked evictions.
He also wants to give the council more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that every new generation's life should be better.
And that means fixing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes as easily as valuable British.
The dream of having a home has become too far away, and the shame of being homeless is still very real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to control Scotland"
Sunderland's chief, Jack Ross, says that his "final ambition" is one day to become the manager of Scotland.
Scot (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after leading St. Mirren again last season at the Scottish football championship.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always dragged me back.
But that opportunity could come true only if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cania.
Former head of Allo Atletica says he didn't feel afraid because he inherited such famous names at such a large club, after he had previously turned down calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at this point will be measured according to whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly falls into the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful if I could take the club back there again."
Ross is only a third year of his management career, after a period during which he was assistant chief in Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the brink of falling out to the winner of the championship next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled taking over Alloe.
"I really believed that managing is what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I've managed well, made a solid living, and enjoyed some pretty successful moments.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure work, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to manage, and now I do. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I have ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for a pint is at 5:30 on Saturday, as the research shows.
The summer heat wave increased revenues for British pubs struggling with finances, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Data show that pubs and bars made revenues rise by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the Business Consultation of the Office of the Chief Controller of Business Books, who collected the data, said: "The continuation of good weather and the participation of England in the World Championship that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pub revenues rose by 2.8 percent, with restaurants now being even more affected.
A 1.8 per cent decline in restaurant revenues in June only deteriorated in July.
Pubs and drinking bars have achieved much greater gains under the same conditions as the losses suffered by restaurants.
The audiences where food is mostly served also suffered heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In manageable pubs and bars, liquor sales rose by 6.6 per cent over the month, and food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, RSM's vacation and catering analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
Time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the external market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with difficulties, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the managers of the food establishments, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide a much needed respite."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown of the growth in the share of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales tracking system for the British pub sector, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and has established an industrial reference value.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
Research reveals that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A 20,000 high school students study showed an increase in the number of “fake Instas” pages
The news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account showing parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, are opening secret accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Instas” accounts whose references to the photo sharing website.
The news has increased the fear of disclosure of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they were using a cleaned-up "main" bill to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
One mother who encountered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager who encouraged others to say "rape me".
The research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of which admit to own private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Scottish athletic committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic committee as executive director at the annual board of directors.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of an athlete and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 and 400m race at the 1996 games in Atlanta, out of his total four Olympic gold, and is now a regular BBC expert, after a passing ischaemic attack he could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting, but he recovered completely, learned to walk again today for the exercise of agility!
Thanks for the encouragement messages!"
Shared opinions on the internet about a commercial for a traitor comparing mothers to cows
The company for the production of traitors with its advertisement, which compares mothers who breast-feeding their children to cows who are milking them, has aroused shared opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product that is claimed to be the "first silent wearer in the world", Elvie for consumer technology published an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to demonstrate the freedom a new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dancing in a barn full of hay and cows with music that reads, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't a udder, these are my breasts."
Then the chorus follows: "Pump, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, milk my ladies."
However, the commercial, published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it sheds light on the "terribles" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that they steal their children a few days after birth," one person wrote.

Another person comments: “Acceptably traumatic for mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added, "A totally lame commercial."
Others defended the commercial, where one woman admitted that her song was "funny".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Betraying milk made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun commercial aimed at mothers who issue milk (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not a commercial that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all danced with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who issue milk say they feel like cows.
The betrayer Elvie, however, is completely silent, no wires or pipes and discreetly fits into the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even come out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the agency Mother, commented: "The traitor Elvie is so revolutionary that she deserves a courageous and provocative launch.
Making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to focus our attention on betraying and all its challenges, and at the same time in a fun and understandable way demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrants has increased, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the severe rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to place children under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and feared endangering their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsoring unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been reported in criminal records before.
"Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the country's family are illegal, and most of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to search for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to the shelter workers' statements, with the aim of carrying out the children's proceedings faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, and not after 60 days, which was a standard earlier.
Many will appear through a video conference call, not in person, to present their legal status case before the immigration court.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to statements from shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Advocates said these concerns were expressed in larger objects such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is highly likely that signs of a child’s suffering will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, while millions have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "a fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mostly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "expanding irrational fears" that prompted refugees not to return.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a pure humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no assistance for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by Syrian forces with the support of Russia on a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that military action would be aimed at jihadists, including the Nusra front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, "that will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to form a post-war constitution for Syria and to open the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the recall and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!"
There's no sign of audience fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, ratings in prime time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on main news broadcast nights.
"It is a fire that attracts people because it is something that we do not understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor" drama, about the secretary of government who becomes president after the Capitol's attack.
Nell Scovell, author of comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because she makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell said.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories that come from Washington can determine the future of the abortion law resulting from Roe v. Wade's proceedings, whether immigrant families can be reunited with the health of the global economy.
Excluding is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, you exceed the level of an informed citizen when you are caught watching a group of experts for the sixth hour discussing how Bob Woodward used sources of "deep background" for his book "Fear", about Paul Manafort'sjacket of an ostrich skin worth $15,000 ("a garment full of arrogance", says the Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, of Mr. Trump's anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never see Super Maria the same way again.
“A part of what he does to you is to see him as a reality show that feeds you something every night”, said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show “The Pawnshop”, about the rotating acting set and the daily plots of Trump’s show (fighting with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because you're going to be behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside watching MSNBC and also filming CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the television, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the balance.
“I remember in the past when we did all these crazy shows, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,’ said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside is being poured into the most uncertain mid-term election race for Congress
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganisation of congressional districts, resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently reorganized district of the suburban part of Pittsburgh highlights Democrat Conor Lamba who won a position in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards were repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutional for the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign-funding fight between the main party fund-raisers, the Committee that raises funds for the democratic campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congressional Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the broadly followed special March elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
That position has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point district.
Political analysts gave little advantage to Democrats.
The U.S. stands for punishing El Salvador for supporting China and then withdrawing
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled Trump's management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to invite US diplomatic mission chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore", spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
However, penalties were considered only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140m US aid in 2017 for, inter alia, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to continue to a similar gathering last year, considered progress in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus ended any consideration of the penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three US envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any more heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The following could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump's judiciary, which now has very significant publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller reportedly also directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to step forward again to the voters, and perhaps ultimately to the jury of his peers.
There are a lot of these "ifs" and I don't want to suggest that the inevitable fall of Mr. Trum - or those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to make a coup against Hitler, only that the West had stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or late.
The Americans now face several of these points of inflection.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy State's Attorney, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this paper reported that last year he secretly suggested recording the president and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's recently ordered investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?"
And above all, shall we vote in the mid-term Congressional elections that will call Mr. Trump to account?
If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers optimistic ahead of confronting Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapida from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Austrians, following an impressive stretch in Spain against Villarrel at the beginning of this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify from the G European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrance's connector from appearing for the first time in the season to a 2 ¢ 2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," said a 31-year-old.
"We entered the game believing we could achieve something, and we scored a point.
Maybe we could have stolen the game in the end, but, generally, the unsolved score is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they got a good score in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that research participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people discussed it with their family members.
About half the respondents in the Nationwide study said they discussed long - term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10% said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they are not taking steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationalwide Life Insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for providing care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices may be a significant factor in determining costs.
Turn on your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value that will help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have the money.
Arrange your legal documents: In root prevent legal battles.
Engage healthcare professionals to determine a reliable person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider giving permission to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to.
Do not forget the minor details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
State the details in the written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just about finances, but who are doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan at hand."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Since communications were interrupted, relief officials were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala province, areas north of Palu that are closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palu.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when he was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, the administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis of the Sulawesi province economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also struck Western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009.: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010.: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016.: A shallow earthquake struck the region of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died from buildings falling.
2018.: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice president candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin (29), from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan state trooper.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in custody of Mat-Su and remains on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded guilty to "innocent, of course," the network reported.
Palina is charged with three Class A violations, which means he could be in prison for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offense, punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time you've had criminal charges filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Alaskan Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised state related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the death toll is expected in the coming days.
The quake hit the immediate proximity of central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipovo, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people have been killed in a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a truck to rent a shop Home Depot to attack a bicycle trail along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he mowed down pedestrians and cyclists who were on their way in October
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipo's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted a serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to a possible death sentence, in accordance with the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury of Saipova struck a 22-point indictment involving eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "mighty planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's way of carrying him out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca," said in a notice of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last in a federal case in New York, 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's married couple were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept the admission of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of being released will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to "mobilise the people's army" during a protest at a conservative conference.
Former leader of the United Kingdom's Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics because one of the members of parliament, Therese May, proposed that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham motorcade that the United Kingdom would have "come out" by now if Mr. Farage had been the secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is emphasized by Tories who tend to stay behind to join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan "Chequers" amid the Brexit supporters, EU supporters.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction of Ö and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the “caos”.
Mr. Bone said at the "Leave Means Leave" campaign rally in Solihull that he wanted to "discard Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have won the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
Voicing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinates.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and that they want to remain is completely incorrect."
Conservative and supporter Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in the procession, addressing the press with the words: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please reject the Chequers and begin listening."
In a prominent message to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers retain their jobs when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be forced to "feel pressure" if they are about to fail the decision made in the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'it won't work'."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel pressure.
We are mobilizing the nation's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remaining supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
A crowd of activists waved banners "Tories v. Brexit" after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the "Canada Plus" plan for undisturbed border conditions, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she "will seriously consider running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke of her future on Saturday at an immediate meeting with Western Massachusetts citizens.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been at the heart of speculation for some time now to stand up to Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the citizens since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which implies a woman at the helm."
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in a shooting with the fatal outcome of a basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU) named Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police released information on Dyteon Simpson's arrest (20), 11am, at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims sustained a bullet wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the crime scene and owning a weapon and killing Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a third-year student of 198 cm who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in 10 first matches last season and averaged 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after his order ensures victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Walteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order would "play a great role in the race".
From his starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called on Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to get into traffic at the back, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes went into the box one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the wheel-to-wheel action that made the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the free interior at risk of falling behind after a double stroke in defense of the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the back row and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race as he trusted his tires to reach a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally made the 44th round, but he failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Walteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a truly remarkable job to achieve a formation finish," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at the rally Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release a letter to the public to Christine Blasey Ford accusing a candidate for Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court of Sexual Abuse.
Addressing the West Virginia rally, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad and nasty and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and dishonest," he said.
“When you look at the disclosures and leaks of information to the public, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.’
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked the information?
Remember her reply... did you release the document - aa, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added by imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detail on Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that information had come from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not release her story to the public," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, which she asked for."
However, her denial did not come upon the approval of the president, who commented at the rally on Saturday evening: "Let me tell you something -- that was a very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use these charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see meanness, nastyness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 ↓ 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for defeating Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning Dundee on Saturday at 5. . . . 3.
In the early minutes, the Giants gained the advantage of two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the domestic tie, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard evened out for Dundee before two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's team, who came out of the background and beat Dundee with 2 ↔ 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth event of the season of the two teams, and the Giants won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening of the match arrived at the fourth minute, at exactly 3:35, assisting Kendall McFaulla, with David Rutherford's assistance to double the lead by hitting Beauvilleier four minutes later.
In a rush to open the game, Sullivan put the home team back in play at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt made Cownie's tie at 3:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with leadership when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The locals regrouped, and Bouchard once again brought them to a tie in measuring the force naked at 2737.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen for the first lead of Dundee at the end of the second third, and he made sure he won when his team was halfway to winning the last third of the game.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, host the Milton Keynes team in the next game Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board avoid earthquakes
In Indonesia, the air traffic controller was declared a hero after he died while securing a safe flight with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many were reported missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to affect the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21 - year - old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower, which was rockin' hard.
He stayed to ensure the safe departure of Batik Air on flight 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He passed away later at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantana to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our hearts are breaking because of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggali, Sigi and Boutongu is limited.
"The death toll is believed to continue to increase, as many bodies are still under ruins, and many could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached altitude and up to six metres destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Emergency vehicles bring bodies every minute.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Widowo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombardo, killing more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that owns the aircraft that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is missing, after it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
In his statement, Air Niugini said they could not trace one of the passengers since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were collaborating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an effort to locate the person concerned.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline announced that six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday, and that they were all in stable condition.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to break through the water that was reaching their waists to the emergency exit of the plane that was sinking.
He said the stewardesses panicked and yelled, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair the dock also helped rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the mainland before the plane sank into about 30 metres of water.
Aviation Security Network data indicate that 111 people have been killed in the accidents of airlines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included Air Niugini.
An analyst exhibits a timeline of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up the case Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to piece together a puzzle on the whereabouts of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time that he was with his own claim with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chambers died, erased her messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense should begin its closing on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to create a negative attitude towards the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The song group "The High Breed" from Bristol argues that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and a reflection on social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Commons are reborn in the UK through artists like Akal and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York nanny suing a couple for firing after "racist" message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her "another black woman".
The couple denies they're racist, comparing the charge to "traitory."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed displeasure when she found out that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEE ANOTHER BLACK WOMAN," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman in her husband's message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "unsatiable" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice for, as she claims, being their former nanny, who was African-American, was doing her job badly, and that instead she was expecting a Filipino, the New York Post quoted her as saying.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a cancellation fee and asking for damages of $350 a day for a six-month period for which she was originally hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to allegations that racists, saying that the end of Maurica's employment was reasonable to do, because of fears that they would not be trusted because of the insult afterwards.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You will sue someone who is in such a situation
"That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although court proceedings are still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social networks, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the readers would not identify with the talking bear, revealed in a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It is difficult to put someone who will read the book for the first time before publishing.
It's very amusing what we now know about Paddington's enormous success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before the little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, would be optimistic when his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of book publishing was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as "a very important member of the family", added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he was not a braggart," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it all happened as an achievement of your own child: you are proud of him even though none of this is really your work.
I think Paddington's success was seen that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always credited Paddington exclusively."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it is really bad and that they believe he will not make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The drugs her doctors gave her to maintain her heart were slowly losing effect and leaving her body system.
She died just before she boarded, and that's when it all went out.
All I had to do was sit around and wait, knowing what was coming.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it all bottled up."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already grieving for her daughter's loss, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the temptations she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a great deal of sympathy for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Messages from women in mourning on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers people can call for support.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with an infectious smile waiting for a brilliant career.
"Everyone remembered him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
Before he died, however, he left his job because he was in a "really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep worrying that it will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with an idea with cards "so people know there's someone you can go and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't sit in silence. You have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner she was with for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas, he was at the very bottom of the table when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye, he didn't want anything else."
She said his death was a great trauma to them, but that they had to overcome it: “All of this leaves a large cavity in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we will move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI investigates
"I thought we might be able to enter a little unity if we could really get something like what he was asking for a time-limited investigation," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee was "decomposing" in the middle of a rooted party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their unwillingness is driven by the choice of moment.
The mid-term elections will arrive in just five weeks, November 6th if, as expected, Republicans do not fare well, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to bring the desired man to the highest court elections in the country.
George W. Bush keeps calling the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, vice president, to break with a decisive vote and confirm his position at the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors from North Korea is falling under the leadership of Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea dropped after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Referring to the United South Alliance ministry's data, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1127 defectors ↔ last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors are stricter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and the higher fees traffickers charge people.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The vast majority of defectors from the north eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them violently.
The relations between the North and the South that are still technically at war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on stalled denuclearisation talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions that they have not made any progress since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and it is out of the question that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm ourselves," he said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temper made him incapable of serving at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if you ever acted like that, you would call a woman 'hysterical'," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated defamation" organised by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because he showed prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Asked if she would try to call off Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats got the majority at the House of Representatives, Pelosi backed off.
"I will say the following: if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not capable of not only being in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the federal appeal court in Colombia County.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Accessibility Care Act or the abortion law stemming from Roe v. Wade's proceedings, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether he would amend some Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it wonderful', Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Righteous criticism, anger that has been gathering for months and years, can't be solved without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be an executive director and who said that she cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: ‘You may think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was that, on one occasion when I cried over unspeakable anger, an elderly woman who was always a little bit afraid of being dragged to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be glad because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider running for president.
"It was not a well-designed decision," she told me through laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race, and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them "Snow White and Seven Dwarves."
As the campaign had already advanced, it was behind on fundraising, vowing not to enter the race if it did not raise $2m.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of the supporters, who gave the men $1,000 each, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
While she was saying she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so consumed with emotions that she was grateful to people who supported her, frustrated about the system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and angry at her for sexism and her throat.
"You would think that I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled the media's reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone.
"She cried."
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The beginning of the trade war between the United States and China has echoed loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the rift between countries can be of benefit to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, US President, fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week has emerged with new customs duties that have affected $200 billion worth of products (150 billion), in fact taxing half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing fought back in some way, and customs was recently introduced from five to ten percent to $60 billion in US goods.
China has promised that the United States will respond with a blow, and the second largest world economy will certainly not surrender soon.
Washington's withdrawal could be achieved by giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war can provide positive support for China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for launching economic steeping in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a scientific thinker who focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says the foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals to help rebuild a country that has been destroyed by a war that lasts more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to establish a normal situation.
All conditions for voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence have now been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept parole or aid from the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 ↔ 10.5 on the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
So far, the United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during almost the entire tournament, on the 16th hole of Pair 3, sent the ball into the water at the first blow, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of the four players who had ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament started this format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was expelled by Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest ranked player of the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to English Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became European with the highest winnings in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't stop the tears.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I won the cup again.
It's all up to the team. I'm happy I could help," Garcia said, full of emotion after a European victory.
He carries the torch to his countryman John Ram, who beat on Sunday in individual games the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods, score 2&1.
"I feel incredible pride over winning Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, which won 14 major titles, and is right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The US team fought all weekend to find a way out, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, US Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll get through it, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off to people.
We're outplayed."
New data on the red tide: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Commission on fish conservation and floral worlds of Florida (FWC) shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay bay.
According to the FWC, the conditions for heterogeneous algae blooming are reported in the areas of Pinellas County, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier .
The red tide extends about 130 miles along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
The flowering areas can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in smaller places than last week.
Red tide has also been spotted in Pasco County.
In the past week, mean concentrations in the Pinelas district or in the corresponding offshore area, low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough district, common to high concentrations in Manatee County, common to high concentrations in the Sarasota district or in the corresponding offshore area, common to medium concentration in Charlotte County, common to high concentration in Lee County or the associated offshore area and low concentration in Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
