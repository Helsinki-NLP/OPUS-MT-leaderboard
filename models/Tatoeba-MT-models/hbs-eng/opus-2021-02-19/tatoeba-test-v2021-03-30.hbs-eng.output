I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stop.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You always sing.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
I live in Istanbul.
Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
I wouldn't hurt them.
Tom was so cold, his teeth were chattering.
What's your name?
Where's your dog?
This is the beginning of a new era.
Sami was Leila's dance partner.
Little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
Without a doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
It was love at first sight.
Stop.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom's still frustrated.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Tom made it clear he wouldn't do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are types of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but in the long run even the best teacher gets angry if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's almost no violence in that town.
They already have one.
You really don't need to do that.
Is your watch correct?
I hope it's a dry time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches the next day?
At least 50 passengers were killed.
It wasn't my fault.
I know him well.
Are they in love?
Nobody knows what's going on behind that door.
I know everything.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Let's see you, Tom.
There's no rule without exception.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
The first thing my mother said to me was, "Are you crazy?"
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never camped.
I'm only listening to you.
He's rarely angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so bad?
Based on what do we know he's innocent?
Did you do the dishes?
When he returned from his duty in Afghanistan, Tom was haunted by nightmares.
I've made up my mind.
My hands are cold.
Thank you so much!
The best lecture you can attend is the one you don't understand.
It won't have any effect.
Don't stare.
Do you have the right one?
I need your help.
Don't you like swimming?
I'm a responsible person.
We have wine.
I wrote his number on a piece of paper.
Add more water.
How was your day?
What Tom is proposing could save us all some time.
Italy is a peninsula.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy right now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
That's his car.
Of course!
Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
They're all gone.
Sign here.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what it is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
This is my wife Edith.
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Either way, you're wrong.
It's hard to give up long-term love at once.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.

Where did you get that idea?
Say hello to your friends.
That company's on shaky feet because of bad debts.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?

Tom hates strangers.
Fuck you!
We have to respect our personal rights.
What is that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you about 2:30?
Anybody want to go to Disneyland with me?
Why is painting trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
That was a ridiculous mistake.
What are you guys eating anyway?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
Don't run in front of the mine!
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to, but he failed.
Yumi's gonna be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslavian.
There's got to be a better way to do this.
It didn't matter to me.
Love me tomorrow!
It's too noisy for me here.
Tom must have been trying to clean this up without soap.
It was raining so hard, we decided to visit him another day.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Merry Christmas!
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
His unkindness made her angry.
She refused my proposal.

The hero's after the hero.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're sincere.
Come play with us.
Do you know that Tom has ever lied?
Mary's Catholic, but her boyfriend's an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
I'm proud of you.
I saw Marcus' house.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy right now.
Who is this man?
Here's some good news.
The refugees are welcome.
Many economists are deafening this fact.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
How deep is that lake?
What year is your car?
What's your name?
You have three cats.
Tom never said anything about it.
You're too young.
Don't stretch.
Tom never asked why.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We don't have an example like that.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
I know who killed him.
Did I ask you?
You can't touch it.
I've seen enough so far.
Turn around!
Be nice.
What am I supposed to see?
It stinks.
It took four kilos of gold to golden the winning medals.
I'll have dinner at seven.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to add numbers in his head.
Look after me, and I'll look after you.
You have to believe me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man in question?
Will you talk to Tom for me?
I bought this yesterday.
How do you say "cat" in Spanish?
We have to act now.
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
I haven't seen him in a while.
We're here to play golf.
I haven't seen her in a while.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't shout.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
Save your energy, you'll need it later.
This has been a pleasant experience.
Tom's in the garage working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income's down ten percent.
You'll see her.
It can be hard to get around an unknown terrain.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Yum, grilled cheese.
Okay, you don't have that.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After a long consideration, I ended up making things at random.
That's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
They were walking by the beach.
We're reducing.
Can you talk to me?
Turn down the TV.
I wear short sleeves in the summer.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me poems he wrote when he was a teenager.

I'll see you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'm going home tomorrow.

I've seen enough so far.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
The job of a lawyer is to prove her client's innocence.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.

Canada is the land-mother of hockey on ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom saves so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
How are you?
This is unquestionably an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She jogs every morning before breakfast.
This road leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
I baked my tongue.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a big fight.
What has science ever done for us?
Stop watching TV and start studying.
Turn left.
We don't know our neighbors.
You'll find a book in the library.
The police found the stolen money.
I've never seen that before.
I got here a few minutes before you did.
Fantastic!
I didn't do it either.
How much is a bottle of beer?
Where's Tony?
I'd like to talk to Tony.
I'll come back later.
You smell nice.
It was obvious Tom wouldn't kiss Maria.
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's the table.
Flowers are blooming.
That's too bad.
His brother is a very capable doctor.
I'm done arguing.
I've got plenty of room.
What are you going to do today?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Don't shout.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train passed you by.
Come and see us.
A young man is often thoughtless.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
Let's get something to eat.
Is that what you think?
Can we agree to disagree?
I'm trying to be careful.
Always trouble when it comes to my child.
Not yet.
One day she wants to study abroad.
Check this out.
Come quick!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
You're absolutely right.
I don't know.
I'm convinced.
Add more water!
Music is important to me.
I've been working on it day after day.
Do you have a favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
No one has a soul.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Where there's grass, there's no water, where there's water, there's no grass.
My friend got 95 points on her math exam.
Tom wouldn't let anyone else in the room.
It's better by heart than by force.
I have a lot to do today.
There's trouble waiting for you.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
There is no word "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you'd be busy.
It's great.
Could that be true?
Be quiet, Tom.
That bag is mine.
Tom left before I got here.
Tell us the ghost story!
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
I want to live in the city.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
Your wish is my command.
I'll phone her tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Tom is Mary's grandfather.
Ammonia's a base.
Check again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
She was educated in the United States.
Tell me what I have to do.
Open your mouth!
I wasn't told anything.
The fire spread to the neighboring building before the fire department arrived.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary did.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad weather kept me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that one's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know a gentleman.
You'll never take me alive!
It's one of the biggest summer music festivals.
I was open and honest.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
Shut your mouth and sit down.
What's this?
He took his clothes off.
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
He's American.
Tom only talks to Mary.
No doubt about it.
The first lesson is easy.
You've put on a lot of weight.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
We're brother and sister.
I'm pretty good at multitasking.
No one's as fast as you.
I agreed to buy it.
She's in a bad mood.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let your imagination be at ease.
How are you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go in that room.
What have you done to me?
It's all here.
Why me?
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
If you do, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered with your foolish affairs.
The light's gone by itself.
Tom asked Mary to give him another chance.
Ask the cop!
We have five fingers on each hand.
We've been working together.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving up to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
What do the papers say?
The system has completed repairs after three years of volunteer work.
I need your signature.

I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.

I'm really happy about it.
Tom suspects Mary and I are up to something.
Where did you find this knife?

Turn right at the next corner.
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I was listening to music.
Are you involved in this?
Do you know why I'm here?
I hope he doesn't notice my mistake.
I must have eaten something bad.
We'll be leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Tom can't swim like he used to.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Both answers are possible.
Tom works too hard.
Avoid addicts on paint thinners.
I liked that one.
He didn't hide his disappointment.
The boy has a horse.
Do you like roller coasters?
We're out of food.
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
It's a nice day.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I have been busy.
Proletarians of all lands, unite!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
Italy is located in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends teased her.
You have every right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You need to work harder.
Why are you being so paranoid?
Tom was going around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She's wondering how that's possible.
Santa lives in the North Pole.
He was born in Ohio.
Please, go.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You picked a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
I tried to be nice.
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I'm having difficulty talking about my feelings.
I'll give you anything you want.
It's their book.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends teased her.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming.
You should come home.
Alice smiled.
She can't be bribed.
Will you turn off the light?
I'll save you.
I'll keep you posted.
We can watch Tom in a suit, at a black big piano with dramatic finger strokes, making music that's very pleasant to listen to.
The strong winds cut many branches from the trees last night.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
We need to prepare the ground for negotiations.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
They laughed because of his mistake.
The path to a man's heart leads over his stomach.
Every ship needs a captain.
It's time to get up.

I didn't write this.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I can't help feeling partly responsible.
People have been good to me.
I know this is weird.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried it?
Dr. Jackson has a good relationship with the patient.

You really don't need to do that.
Why are you so smart?
I'm cooking lunch.
I wonder what Tom's planning on doing.
I'm fat.
To join the choir, it is necessary to read the notes.
Tom dozed off.
They wanted an apology.
What did I do wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
You're not done yet?
You're very rude.
He makes good money.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one who can do it here.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It's very natural for a human to always give himself an advantage over the interests of others.
I'm eating here.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
They made him captain of the football team.
Why are you still up?
I was at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Deaf, insensitive children can sometimes grow up to be sociopaths.
I'd like him to stay with you.
The job of the police is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you hand me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We all work too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's learning very quickly.
You're different.
She doesn't know the hatred of others.
This is gonna make our job a lot easier.
He loves football.
What time can you get here?
The monks used to play tennis in monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids off the meds.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if maybe I was dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
The game can be postponed until next week.
I have a soul.
Driving to work for an hour and a half is a pain in the ass.
It's the right thing to do.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This isn't important.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm a natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do it.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll make something up.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
You're drinking coffee?
Some of us consider such views to be pure madness.
It's working.
Someone could get hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary while he was away.
We've had enough of you.
You won't be able to handle this job.
We all know Tom did it.
She's Chinese.
I don't feel like vodka.
We need to be sensible.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
He needs her.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom got the worst of it.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
I'm more worried about you than the future of Japan.
I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a slight nausea.
Is this the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's OK.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
I've wet to the skin.
Come play with us.
And that was just a lot of trouble.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Not many people know it exists.
Did you get the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on my math test.
The worst headaches are caused by insufficient ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Look into this.
What's your name?
They're trying.
My future is in your hands.
It's a fake, isn't it?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom's cold-blooded.
That's what I used to do.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
Can you tell silver from tin?
Hands up!
I don't practice as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
She doesn't speak English, let alone French.
That's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
In short, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
She's a teacher.
Without water, it's impossible to live.
I played the piano a long time ago, so I can still play a little.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
We're finally here!
She's in good hands.
He figured he'd have to work in the garden two hours a day.
Apples and pears are given, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
The professor's excuse is almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like to practice.
I love you!
I'm really proud of it.
We were in the last place.
I've contributed.
Is it true Tom can't read and write?
I can read German, but I can't say that.
That doesn't sound like you.
She's achieved her goal.
I'm twice Tom's age.
The madness has crossed the line.
Isn't that black?
This isn't a children's book.
You're absolutely right.
Come sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
Like I don't know that!
Let's not talk about this right now.
Have fun.
It's time we parted ways.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
The meeting is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you eating anyway?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man hopes as long as he lives.
Be careful.
Let's discuss our options.
Don't worry, if you help me, everything will be fine.
I've been looking at miracles.
That was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin is cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom will take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate that.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "Well, do you remember the one she sent you when you asked her to give you pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yes." "Yes." And then she told you to write a review of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from it?" "I realized that Phillips' screwdriver was convincing, but not seductive; and that Rerity was charging heavily for things that I think she should do as a friend."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People have been nice to me.
How did I miss that?
I don't want to take any more of your time.
I only go to church out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
"Did he elaborate?" "Yes."
Not every lamp is magic.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
I was very excited.
You don't have to eat right away before you go to sleep.
Tom will wait.
What happens now?
I need five more minutes.
The students didn't know how to answer.
She's ashamed of lying.
I'm not a night owl.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
Good to see you again.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who should be doing this.
Tom will call.
He lit a torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a really good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some room.
There's truth in what Tom says.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your whining.
Get out!
We've got two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
The horse must have tripped and the knight fell off his horse.
I haven't forgotten.
There are islands at sea.
I'm looking into it right now.
Mini skirts are modern again.
What are we really looking for?
She's achieved her goal.
Tom can do whatever he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up!
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
This medicine will ease your headache.
He disappeared without a trace.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what likes both of them.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never takes the train.
He's addicted to Starbuck coffee.
The book's on the table.
The two sides will be giving speeches this week.
I'm planning on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Cardboard's stronger than paper.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
Fadil changed his mind.
I've never noticed that before.
It happens.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw a cat.
I'm in a cast.
Mom just went shopping.

Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
To be honest, I don't know.

That makes sense.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.

Maybe she has other plans?
This isn't a sentence.
Thank you all for coming!
The patient's out.
Thank you all for that.

Mom just went shopping.
He was bare-breasted and barefoot.

If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why this language? Because it is also beautiful and stimulates our learning. The international language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. After all, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries.

What makes you think Tom would do that?
They'll know.
I didn't have a good time last night.

Come and help me.

Fish, please.
I think I'm fat.
I think we got lucky.
Don't talk.
Is French taught at your school?
Come have a drink with me.
If I could understand, I would tell you so.

I took the first step.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
They've been evacuated to the American field hospital.
We'll run in the park.
How far is it from here?
You can't sit next to me.

Mom, I'm hungry.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked my bike.
And now a word from our sponsor.
I'm not at all satisfied with the situation.

That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
Stay calm.
I'm armed.
Tom can't help himself.
Our eyes can't see infrared rays.
It's time for bed.
Tom is very intelligent.
Can I replace this?
Tom wanted a nicer cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.

We'll never know why.
How are you feeling?
Everyone tells me I'm weird.
Bitcoin and Etherium are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.

Does your head hurt?

That's better now than he was before.
Tom and Mary are as different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked my opinion about who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he doesn't really want fulfilled and it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be bitter disappointment for him. One such desire is also the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, a man would become completely sick of eternal life, and he would long for death.
Water is liquid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car by myself.
She takes care of her old mother.
Italy is far from Brazil.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
My wife's father is my father-in-law.
I want to live in the city.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
The news has come.
Nobody really wants us.
They all paid.
Be careful.
Yogurt is made of milk and cream.
I'm alone.
How are you?
Don't drink the water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
It was just the beginning.
The book's sold out.
The price of gold changes every day.
Be nice.
Look around!
Tom got married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He's a scientist.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come back tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is taking pictures of trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
Welcome back.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a commoner.
We can't go back.
I'm gonna take a shower.
What are you planning on doing this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Could anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
It's none of our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why do you ask?
I saw Marcus' house.
At least he's honest.
It's really bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
You too, Brutus?
Ataturk's house was born in Thessaloniki.
People make mistakes.
It's snowing.
I thought you needed help.
Does this make sense?
I like your glasses.

He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
I know your name.
Let's hear your excuse.
Dad said no.
They've formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom was jumping up and down.
Tom's dog is down.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
You taught us that.
No, no, no.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not leaving me, are you?
Don't overdo it.
I can't authorize this project.
You're texting Mary?
I'll save you a seat in the front row.
Mary's pushing her kids to play football.
Are they here yet?
Don't forget to give me my pen back.
Little flowers bloom at night.
I was counting to 200.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
One day you should try.
I'm gonna stay home with my grandparents for the weekend.
What did you conclude?
I prayed for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of his nerves.
Bathroom's upstairs.
It's Christmas tomorrow.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
Tom reads a lot.
He's only a few minutes away.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work at the hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals tortured animals recklessly.
I'm going to live in Cambodia.
How long are you gonna get mad and yell at us?
Please stop here.
How important is that really?
Shall we have an aperitif?
Tom complains all the time.
If you want, I'll teach you to play ukulele.
I'm getting used to it.
It's not that bad.
She seemed offended by what he said to her.
I like to play music written by my friends.
Tom confessed to that.
I've been there twice.
Actions speak louder than words.
Is this where Tom sits?
Enough!
It's hard working with you.
Tom's put on weight.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Guilty.
Don't answer that.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the pictures!
We need to tear down a few old houses.
What have you been doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
I'm so tired I can't study.
I've never seen his face.
Tom's very careful.
When will you be leaving?
This report wasn't written very well.
I want a new bike.
She points out that this latest move by the government has multiple meanings.
They say love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It lasted about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer me.
Five brothers worked together on a farm.
It could be a trick.
The company is known for its high quality products.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
Thank you for accepting my request for a friend on Facebook.
His hair covered almost his entire face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll make it up to you.
Why is he here?
A student from Oslo who forged his degree to get into college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish that had occurred to me.
Tom made vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You've been really good to me.
I'll finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you do the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not just the essay, it's all these terrible questions and explanations that drive me crazy!
The weekend's here.
I'll be back next week.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I want to see her very much.
That was a lucky guess.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame it all on Tom.
He started yelling.
I'll come when I finish my homework.
Clean it up a bit.
Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
Is Tom out of his mind?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's take another look.
Last time I went to the beach, I burned up pretty bad.
Stand back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We fixed some of the damage caused by the spatter on your car.
I became a pensioner after fourteen-five years of office work.
Why are you suddenly curious?
His girlfriend wasn't supportive.
I just had a bath.
Do you suspect me?
Luckily, Tom wasn't seriously injured.
Generally, children love candy.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
Tom decided to take the day off.
How could I resist?
Gold is much heavier than water.
The phone is an amazing device.
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car by myself.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We don't go into that.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
This is my question.
Hang in there, Tom.
Tom definitely got the worst of it.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
There's no match for him.
There's nothing wrong with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I began to learn English when I was twelve, and I was interested in languages, but not in that degree. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; therefore, it is time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the tune of that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need an honest girl.
She's a rookie.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
Tom's not getting away.
I'd go.
I don't take bribes.
Get down!
Tom couldn't handle it.
Anything you can think of can help.
You'll be better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the eyes of the likes of you, but this is just pathetic.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
And what if I'm gay?
Anyway, he'll definitely come.
Please leave this place as clean as you'd like to find it.
We'll get through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
That's all we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's life.
What's your name?
I understand.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I feel like crying.
I sympathize.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He'll be done soon.
You learn by doing.
You'll never walk alone.
It's Tom you want.
The police are after me.
Did you see anyone there?
Either way, you're wrong.
They won't take her.
There's no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
Nobody said anything.
The book's on the table.
He's a real aristocrat.
I'm doing my job.
It's quiet again.
I didn't make it.
We know.
Tom goes to graphic design school.
He lied to you.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
Music is his passion.
You should face reality.
Light waves pass through space and various materials.
We managed to escape just in time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
Carthage must be destroyed!
How much is that?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
It should work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't object to your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
That's just how it happens.
Have some.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I'm hungry from all this running.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of the word.
The spider tickles.
He's talking about others how he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused, he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
It seems okay to me.
Whatever you think?
You've changed my life.
We'll get through the jungle somehow.
The reaction isn't always the best way to act.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to drive him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who complained should be compensated with a proportional portion of the annual interest fee.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it's possible, but in practice it's very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
That's my money, too.
It's over, it's over.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the name of the file before trying to restore the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only vodka from Russia is real Russian vodka!
I didn't get nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
I'm good at a lot of things.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
Tom's always been a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom's one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
How long do you think Tom was getting ready for the exam?
Some book describing the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You shouldn't throw rocks at a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He's out.
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd like to get involved.
You can't touch that.
Don't quibble.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
Mary's a retired nurse.
I probably won't be watching TV tonight.
Did Tom get the worst of it?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
Those are nice shoes.
The girl sees the boy.
We're also calling Robert "Bob."
It's very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French still isn't very good.
They're teachers.

You're not funny.
Tom left instead of Mary.

I don't know Latin very well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.
I'm waiting for my turn.
That's not the main question.
I'm very upset with the news.
The girl eats bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you prefer tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not like that.
They know you.
I passed every test.
What are you doing today?
What's on your mind?
I'll kill you!
I was cold as a syringe.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
It was snowing yesterday.
We were walking through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I wrote this song just for you.
Your house, your freedom.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
Even if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it!
We've been studying all afternoon.
Are you going to send this as a mail order?
What do you suggest?
They say love is blind.
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Look out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room's dark.
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They were slowly moving forward.
Why is love so hard?
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
I'm too late, aren't I?
Don't stare.
It's blue on you.
Come visit us soon.
Have you been in an accident?
What are you and Tom doing?
Tom's worried about what might happen.

I don't know if I'll have time.
I went there voluntarily.
We're all out of alcohol.
Ticket, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
Why are we laughing?
My friend lives in the middle of nowhere.
Do you think Tom would want to go fishing with us next weekend?
She yelled at him, but he didn't hear it.
Water is life.
What are you doing today?
He'll probably win the championship.
After silence, what is most precise about the inexplicable is music.
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
It's not over until it's over.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a long day ahead of you.
That's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't be a part of it.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully served.
Tom and Mary would make a beautiful couple.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Don't work too hard!
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always act rational.
I didn't do that either.
Did you pass your exams?
We'll have to walk now.
I'll set you free.
I strongly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
How about we make a Facebook group so we can discuss learning foreign languages?
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Do we agree?
It's not that bad.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Stop smoking.
Tom went that way.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't do it.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
But why?
May I see your ticket?
What happens now?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
They set up the library with new books.
It's clear.
How about some chocolate cheese?
Today's your daughter's birthday.
Will someone please tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typing error.
Your book is twice the size of mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom's got a nice garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It's pointless to be idle during a student's life.
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got naughty hair.
I've seen enough so far.
I hate that one.
We're gonna miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Toma will take a look.
Tom had a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I want to go.
I could come with you.
The cost of life is rising.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you disarm a bomb?
I think Tom could do it.
I need five more minutes.
He sleeps like a baby.
I bet you know who told me that.

Tom's the best student in the class.
How is this your fault?
My phone number is 9876-5432.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
How did I miss this?
This is a sentence.
Life is sweet.
That's my cat.

Mrs. Klein is in her 80s, but she's still very active.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
Trust me.

Then our handler came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
We know enough.
I just want something to eat.
I'm so tired, I can barely keep my eyes open.
Gardening is fun.
It's never too late to study.
Throw me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Cover your mouth while you cough, sneeze or yawn.
Where'd you get the keys?
Have you ever hung a video on YouTube?
I was very interested in building a more intense academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Tom gave me a few books.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait till Monday.

Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
How much is this umbrella?
I'm into her.
Tom did his homework in the kitchen.
I could kill you right now.

It was fun celebrating together.
I'm afraid I dislocated my right shoulder.
Die!
You really need to take a shower.
What's the purpose of life?
I don't want to work under those conditions.
Mayuko avoided hard work.
She has short hair.
Take it easy.
My right hand's numb.
I don't know almost anything about you.
Did you do something?
You taught us that.
You can't talk to her.
You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy Mother's Day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
Everyone appreciates Henry.
I thought you were married.
It was a huge success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
A little bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
I feel safe with you.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
The chairman opened the session.

It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll study harder.
I'm hurt.

None of us saw Tom do it.

I'm Tom's grandfather.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
The more I know people, the more I admire dogs.
You misspelled my name.
You're different.

It's been a pain in the ass.
My teacher assigned me the longest chapter.
What'd you come up with?
You were made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a typo.
Are we done?
Am I seeing things?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a stickler.
Control yourself.
I'm tired, but I'm fine.
Butter is made of milk.
Tell her.

Tom seemed furious.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
Excuse me.
I haven't been home all day yesterday.
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay until tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.

Word spread fast.
Am I that different?

It helps.
Dima slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you could do it.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we almost there?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This is making me very uncomfortable.
We're from Russia.
The cost will soon rise.

It could be a weapon.
Put the book on the top shelf.

Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really that happy?
I took off my wig.
I have no one but her.

Which one of your friends is coming?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play many times.
They work together.
You tried.
The toy store is closed.
I'm taking you dancing.
I'm a student.
This is my e-mail address.
Tom might be trying to convince Mary to do it.
She makes a mosquito out of an elephant.
You told me not to lie.
He was more of a member of the social elite than a representative of the broad masses.
I'm terrified.
You tried.
His opinion is reasonable.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
Can you read that sign in front of us?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Take your time.
Give me the pen.
Your answer is incorrect.
Just tell Tom I called.
There's no answer to what's best, because it's always individual and it depends on the situation.

It has to do with...
It can hardly be about passion, maybe it's just about sex.
Are you done washing the dishes?
I pulled an ace.
I'm the only one who can do it here.
Tom will pay.
Tom lost his job.
Hunting season's over.
I love the cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
Did Tom give it to you?
She's spending the holidays at her uncle's.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
Ladies have the advantage.
I'm motivated.

What a tragedy!

Early in the morning, two lucky grabs.
Do we have one of those?
Is this your suitcase?
These are Spanish villages to me.
This town isn't big enough for the two of us.
Tom stopped for a second.
Due to bad weather, the plane was delayed.
Investigate them.
I'm in better shape than you are.
I'm not that worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
Better a sparrow in the hand than a pigeon on a branch.
Do you have time to have lunch with me?
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I think it's possible to do that.
Tom thinks I don't know what he said.
I'm gonna take a nap in about an hour.
Now I'm pretty happy.
It's as warm today as it was yesterday.
He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test before he was sent for laboratory testing.

The session is over.
I baked some bread.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We have to follow Tom.
Why are you acting like a child?
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
What's the Wi-Fi code?

I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.

That's crystal clear.

I want to answer the last question first.
Did you tell Tom this?

I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, a crossover with that will happen eventually.
Tom rules French well.
I couldn't help Tom do it.

Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I turned Tom down.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
That kid kept crying for hours.
I'd buy that one.
This is way out of line.
I have a headache today.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
I want to go.
Apparently, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
French is his mother tongue.
Her words made him angry.
I was laughing.
It wasn't too hot.
I'm completely broke.
I almost forgot my passport.
I've been looking for you.
Tom reads a lot.
Enough!
I hope you're not talking about me.
He that layeth the sword, by the sword, and by the death.
You're good to everyone.
I'm not usually this busy on Mondays.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I'll be home tomorrow.
The teacher explained the meaning of the word.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.

I brought you some coffee.
During the observational experiment, Tom couldn't describe any pictures from the wall of his living room, even though he lived there for two years.
I've never seen Tom so busy.
Seems like you haven't been yourself lately.
It's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
I hope that's true.
I wonder whose line this is.
Tom was buying time.
Everyone's holding their breath.
Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
That's not funny at all.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
What did you like most about it?
I like watching you work.
Tom suggested Maria see a doctor.
I hope we visit Beijing too.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
You're my inspiration.
This time I refrained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
There's a Mr. Itoh here to see you.
Be careful.
She'll pay $50 tops.
Did anyone call me?
We'll have lunch together at half past ten.
What's his name?
I'm still a little tired.
I think I'm gonna shit myself.
I'm a vegetarian.
The picture's in this book.
That it tends to maximize its own interest, happiness or security seems very natural for one human being.
I can do it as a joke.
I'm not singing.
It's strange that no one knows the victim.
We're five minutes away.
I have a few gifts.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation isn't nearly as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit that.
That was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Over the last few days, I've been doing research on the project's earnings, but I think all options will require a sudden change in my lifestyle, which is a tricky thing.
Is everything okay between us?
I've never been camping.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the rings on the tree that we knocked down and discovered that it was thirty years old.
See you later, Tom.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Let's make an appointment.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you have him?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems upset.
I'm a very sad man.
Boston is a great city.
We're hoping people will like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
Come here, I want to show you something.
I'm remodulating.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're afraid of me.
Yesterday I was happy.
You're my sun.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one was helping us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
She divorced her husband.
I'm here.
I want to live in Brazil.
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
Mary is Tom's only daughter.
He still has no experience with this job.
Can you help us?
Would you chill out?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
I've changed my mind.
Based on the information I gave you, what story would you like to go out with?
Who can't be proud to be a Serb, with their historic highest achievements - the slaughter of chiefs and genocides?
That's what makes it so simple.
Do you know how to disarm a bomb?
Are you gonna invite her to the party?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom lost his touch.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
He's not missing anything.
Tom's gonna get a look.
I wonder if anyone could help me.
I'm surprised.
They were all smiling.
I miss him.
You should spend more time on the outside and less on the inside.
Tom played the high card.
He left his family and moved to Tahiti.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You underestimate me.
What's your favorite YouTube video?
Millie listens to music.
The sea is green.
I don't have a guitar.
Are you gonna turn me in?
You can't blame it all on Tom.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
He canceled the last-minute meeting.
We're just getting started.
My friend can speak Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Please, get out of the way.
I like Tom, but he doesn't like me.
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written part of the report.
I just finished it.
We're talking about the wolf, and the wolf's at the door.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
I have a feeling he knows a secret.
It was kind of weird.
Tom won't pass the test.
Will you do that for me?
I really enjoyed it.
No one has died... yet.
In my beginning is my end.
Can we, people, digest the grass and extract nutrients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
How would you translate that?
It's almost half past three.
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
Who is she?
I bought this yesterday.
The odds are against me.
I'll quit.
The kids are playing outside.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Do what you want, I don't care.
She expects us to help her.
Who are you?
Call me at any time, I always have a shoulder to cry on.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I'm not gonna push you.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Thanks for coming!
What's your blood type?
Are we leaving soon?
I found him a book.
They sell sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does that sometimes.
Do you have news for me?
I'm thirsty.
It's our duty to help them.
He didn't do it on purpose.
Thank Tom for his help.
Simplicity is the highest level of refinement.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
The weather stays bad.
Photos of nature and animals, painted in complete silence and quietness, are real masterpieces.
My mother died the day I got married.
You want to meet her?
I'm never bringing this up again.
We're out of food.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
You're the boss.
We have two children.
I think Tom's careful.
Oh, no!
I forgot the baby-surveillance device.
Tom's upstairs.
He's kind.
Just relax.
Smoking is forbidden in every part of the restaurant.
You don't have to come to the office, take the day off.
The white family will be in Tokyo at half past ten.
What have you done to me?
Enjoy.
Let me write you some steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
This is the beginning of a new era.
Mary looks cute, whatever she's wearing.
Shit happens.
Look out!
Tom failed to present any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You don't even know his name, do you?
We don't need to look down on the poor.
You have a bad temper.
Is this your phone?
I was just leaving.
They split up after their wedding anniversary.
This house was built by a famous architect.
He took care of the baby.
I bought this yesterday.
I've had a really bad day.
The whole country's talking about it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made an omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm naughty.
Yesterday I was happy.
From the way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Husbands and wives should help each other as long as they live.
All we need is water.
I wonder if Tom likes dancing as much as Mary does.
What would you like to know?
Now is not the best time.
He's not a child anymore.
I try to vent the futon at least twice a week.
My education made me who I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join?
Leave the book on the top shelf.
You stole my idea.
We could be happy here.
He's very educated.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
He's back on his feet again.
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
Our yacht club has ten members.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
Mom, that aunt and man hold hands, they're very good friends, aren't they?
Can I walk you home?
I just saw the ambassador of Saudi Arabia resign.
Be careful.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I had problems solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I have one brother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that information.
I didn't do it.
I have a few friends.
I have to look for her.
I can't wait.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
One moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom wants to know when you'll be done.
Call me.
Tom still seems upset.
That's what the doctor ordered.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm texting Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came a little earlier today than usual.
Do you believe in eternal life?
A horse could be eaten.
I've never actually met Tom.
Which one's easier?
Tom demanded an increase.
Fadil wasn't in the house.
I've never noticed that before.
This is supposed to work.
Where have you been all afternoon?
What do you have to do?
I always liked Tom better.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the paper and read it on the train on the way to work.
I have house ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're ridiculous.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Horses sleep standing up.
Let me try another one.
Work slowly.
I didn't do that either.
The stories of Snori Sturluson, among other things, say that Christianity in Norway was spreading through violence.
Answer me now.
Make yourselves at home!
The students didn't know how to answer.
Did you know that before?
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I tripped.
I assumed you were busy.
Who are you running from?
That elegant gold-plated necklace with hearts is the necklace that will "shake your world".
Your answer is correct.
I love Leanne.
Everything happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It was raining heavily.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Have some more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.
Don't argue with me.
The dinner was held at the White House.
You should leave the planning to me.
You can avoid a lot of trouble if you just do it right the first time.
Marie jumped out of the window into the river.
She was crying.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
He invited her to a date.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
Check, please.
Broccoli is one of the healthiest kinds of vegetables.
I'm terrified.
I'm doing great.
Can you enjoy this book?
Serbia's capital is Belgrade.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Maria always walk around holding hands.
Don't worry, I'll translate it for you.
What did I do wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I've missed so many opportunities.
We heard her crying.
It helped me a lot.
You don't have to yell, I'm not deaf!
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
We don't have a choice.
Baseball is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
She's violent right now, she needs to be avoided.
I was just stalling.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
Tell him I'm innocent.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
I'll visit him in a few weeks.
Italy is not Greece.
It's for my friend.
They don't speak English.
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
What's that?
He gave himself up.
I can't wait forever.
This is the beginning of a new era.
America is a big, friendly dog in a small room, and every time he waves his tail, he knocks over a chair.
I don't have a ticket.
The doctor works at the hospital.
Nothing happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He's got a good reputation.
You'll be famous.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Welcome to Tatoeb.
Everything's different.
What's your Bosnian name?
The truth must be told.
Look at the size of it!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage working on his bike.
Is your car blue?
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
He lied to you.
How many mosques are there in Istanbul?
He was late because of the accident.
I always eat fruit and oatmeal for breakfast.
Do you think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that water quality be checked once a year in the pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people to draw your attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a great void.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary in a long time.
That history tells us interesting factors.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I interrupt you for a second?
I hate science.
The students didn't know how to answer.
Do you have a book?
He's got two cars.
If you don't bother them, they won't bother you either.
It's the good intentions that matter.
I've already thought about it.
Men stay children all their lives.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Come on, admit it.
The two of us are so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking around.
Where's the beach?
Do you want to know something specific?
Welcome.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Interability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students were in a meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the last-minute meeting.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You're opening the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters believe Maria is the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom will not vote in this election.
I bought flowers.
I'm sure you'll do just fine.
She's back from the hospital.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What happens now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Make room.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
Someone called.
Be careful.
Winter is snowtime.
Under what name?
What are you gonna do about Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful what you wish for.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who will come with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
Easy come, easy go.
Give him time.
Who waits, greets.
I'll have to say, yes.
We've never been apart.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor examined her thoroughly.
At that point, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 per cent of Norway's population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
They're fake tears.
Tom's very rude.
Don't forget to write the date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean up this mess.
Could you have read that?
Try again.
It's perfectly normal.
How's your life going?
They say there was a new restaurant built.
The price of this book is $5.
I want a sword like this.
Can you keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
Keep it quiet.
When the fire broke out, he slept heavily.
My big sister sings well.
I never thought of that.
Her childhood illness blinded her.
Some friends can't be replaced.
Although the existence of this phenomenon is mere speculation, there may be evidence in the future to support it.
Keep it down there.
Tom explained it in detail, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want to eat some cheese.
That wouldn't like it.
I'll have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom double-parked.
Can you speak Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back.
What are you gonna do about Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to protect the moral and material interests that stem from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the creator.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands at sea.
I've never had trouble sleeping.
Tom's hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went for a walk.
Any other options?
The amount for the work done and the interest on the capital invested was several million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what's gonna happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who's paying.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three of the boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't entirely agree with you.
It's a nice day.
Are you saving this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think we women have an extra sense.
Sunday is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in Southeast Europe.
I'll be back late.
You're a little liar.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
I'll send a letter to my brother who lives in Sappor.
The politician had sticky fingers because 5% of each contract ended up in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought that was my job.
I'm a professor.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hate us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I've sent a letter to anyone.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't fight.
Did you write a report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
American English is no better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours a day.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'm gonna take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, not his.
We have four French lessons every week.
Let's start right now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Fadil demanded that Dania give him the money.
Alone is our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
He broke into my home.
Bathroom's upstairs.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Typical Gothic church.
It was a presentation that pleases the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Is this your notebook?
Somehow we survived.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Keep the change.
It's quarter to two.
I think you should take the test again.
Why would Tom turn himself in?
Europeans took advantage of other civilizations 500 years ago.
Tom didn't seem to be doing what he was supposed to do.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom drove the flies away.
He suddenly stopped smoking.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to refute what she said.
I got a cat and a dog, the cat's black and the dog's white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There's a cup on the table.
It makes me very angry.
Is it still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Don't you agree?
Would you like me to look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very kind of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what's it to you?
I wish it had occurred to me.
I'm drinking milk.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw a cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safely.
I have no idea what was going on in his head to refuse such a favorable proposition.
I just got up.
How does it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't do it.
Tom's strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate hot dogs with potato salad.
Come alone.
To be a good kid, you need to go to bed and get up early.
How are you?
I'm thinking of going abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lecher.
This is how it's supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, after becoming a victim of a conspiracy, he was convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
My French sucks.
We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
My mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
It stinks.
Can you let Tom know I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned my own French.
I like walking.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
He's got one foot in the grave.
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm sympathetic.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy as hell.
I'm sorry I didn't answer your letter earlier.
Don't drink the water out of the dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I've been reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today were written by me.
That doesn't scare me in the least.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I even slept last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's a picture of her.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
Nice to meet you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
This place looks a lot different than it used to be.
Is it yours?
Why are rabbit ears big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
There's no such thing as souls.
I want to help.
I know how it's done.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom really is an idiot.
Yeah.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to work things out as we go along.
You're working too hard.
This one's pretty cool.
Not a word to anyone.
I really enjoyed it.
That can be trusted to some extent.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of stuff.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Keda.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
Sorry, I'm late for my session.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this paper.
It's 5:00 in the morning in Brazil.
Tom suggested that Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's pretty cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom's been arrested three times.
This isn't that much fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she'd reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
You don't learn that in school.
Is it clear?
I don't feel like going out tonight.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish can't live outside the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop fighting it!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy I can't help you.
I have two flowers.
Move!
Please wait a little longer.
I won't do it!
I'm tired of arguing.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I like watching you play.
Good for you!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What's the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could get a kick out of it.
I just want to get out of the way.
Dania continued to follow Fadil’s example.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day Bill goes fishing.
Don't let a chance like this slip away.
What time do you have breakfast?
Be careful.
She's in her first year of college.
I looked for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Due to bad weather, the plane was delayed.
Can I have your dictionary?
My fluent knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not for the display of my often contradictory, emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a teacher.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a nerd.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a tremor in my heart.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
Show me the photos!
She fantasized about becoming a nurse.
I'm sorry to always bother you.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
Wonderful!
I'm ticklish.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it on time?
It's funny the mailman hasn't come yet.
Try doing one thing at a time.
How do we stop it from happening?
His novels are popular among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'm about to buy a boat.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not American, he's English.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
Did you ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a mechanic.
His misfortune has taught me much.
Are we ready to go?
Why?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom isn't sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of music for the bassoon.
Secretary of the United States John Carey broke his right femur in a bicycle accident in France on Sunday.
Where there's a lot of midwifes, they're lame kids.
Tom's tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
It was just whipped cream on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were amazing.
Pick one.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
The brakes are squeaking.
Are you fully recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like gum.
Don't move!
The accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I drop that?
Are you happy?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I'd known Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by his looks.
It's useless.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, known for its luxurious dishes, will be somewhat more modest this year.
Did you report it to the police?
He gave himself up.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does it.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often bullies when they were kids.
Introduce me to Tom.
After a long consideration, I ended up making things at random.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves on words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house for dinner yesterday.
Look at the size of it!
That's the truth.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now's a great time to buy one.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom's out of it.
Tom interfered with people he should never have interfered with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write.
Tom's ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
Termites eat wood.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
You let me down.
You shouldn't judge a man by his looks.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I pretended not to know what was going on.
They'll make speeches tomorrow.
What's this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me, too.
That's different than I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans, then?
The kids are asleep.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many small towns in England, has quite a long history.
Tom closed the door.
I wasn't having any fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and made a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
That smells delicious.
Phase one is complete.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even extra money.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Toma feels.
She takes care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French taught at your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before he crossed the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives next door?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom will recover.
It is important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to no one liking me.
The brakes are squeaking.
Find Tom.
You've really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
It's as simple as beans.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite a poem he wrote when he was 13.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
It was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
I hope tomorrow's a good time.
Maria's giggling.
Let's sit down.
Come take a look.
Tom does look familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm out.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom saved all the letters Mary sent him.
Why don't you go surface with Tom?
He's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
The female chiffon isn't complete without the little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the bathroom here?
Happy Easter!
Tom helped me save a few bucks by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
There's nothing else to do but admire him for his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's worked his whole life.
Die!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom.
My watch needs fixing.
Tom will live.
Please read between the lines.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'm gonna be late.
I had a quick lunch.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave a message for Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
I want what you want.
Health is a fortune.
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he never made it on time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a rock.
Can I call you back in 20 minutes?
The wind is cheap and pure energy source.
As little as we know of its origins, at least we can be sure that the pilot is Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
The deer is faster than stronger.
People used to write books with typewriters.
You can't blame it all on Tom.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom sees nothing wrong with letting Maria learn how to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope not.
Give me an example.
How could I hate Tom?
Take this away.
How barbaric!
What day is it tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I look forward to your letter.
When the cat's gone, the mice get in the water.
We need that from Tom.
Japan is ruled by the Emperor and the King of Spain.
It's Ali's book.
Are we gonna see Tom again?
The world was on its own during the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie's drinking milk.
Where did you see Tom?
It's quiet again.
I'm engaged.
Can we order, please?
What does he do?
By the way, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They laughed at me.
I'm angry.
Take it easy, Tom.
Can you give an example?
I don't intend to go to Busta with you this weekend.
He stole a very precious diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom's drinking like a charm.
Just like old times.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
That's not like you.
He's always here between 5:00 and 6:00.
Tom's been admitted to the hospital.
I hope I can do that.
I don't like stubborn people.
Sitting around all day is bad for you.
The rainy season begins in June.
You always do.
That's totally normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.
The wall looked smooth and impenetrable.
Do you hear something?
He's got two cars.
Tom will probably still be angry.
He greeted us and left.
Welcome to Tatoeb.
I'm looking, and I can't see.
I'm bleeding.
I'm glad you answered.
We're close friends.
We can't be friends anymore.
In the future, many workers will be replaced by robots.
Thomas was completely drunk.
I admit I'm wrong.
That house belongs to him.
My father listens to classical music.
Who?
How many people live on Earth?
Now I'm a little worried.
Come back any time.
We're from Russia.
So be it.
Which I should be doing on my own time.
We have to keep working.
We had a terrible fight.
Who ate the last donut?
Are you free tonight?
If I love you, what's it to you?
You don't speak English.
They shook hands.
They recognized Tom.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Everyone you meet is fighting a battle that you don't know anything about.
I'm afraid of death.
Don't run.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Tom's my big brother.
One man was arrested and charged with intentional manslaughter by 25-year-old Maria Thompson.
Come on, you two.
The film was inspired by a novel of the same title.
Peter loves Jane.
Is this a real diamond?
I don't want to be cruel.
Are you free tonight?
Do you have time to help me?
This is self-evident.
Tom's furious.
Tom will make sure he gets there on time.
Tom says I'm too aggressive.
What does that mean?
We'll never know why.
My favorite teacher was Jackson.
Tom's bored.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
I have to do what's right.
I like watching you dance.
They switched coal oil.
John came to Japan yesterday.
It was snowing.
We've already decided not to do that.
How can I say that in your language?
That's not a good sign.
He's a doctor, and he's also a writer.
It's hers, isn't it?
All rights reserved.
I don't live here.
I gave my mother nineteen flowers for Mother's Day.
I hope you like it.
This ticket's worth a month.
I didn't tell him you were here.
Nobody knows what's going on behind that door.
I think Tom's pretty angry.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Turns out the price was lower than I thought.
Some feel that spontaneous human combustion is really happening, but I'm not convinced.
Who's going to read such a fat book?
It's good to see you again.
We'll visit you sometime.
I don't think so.
You need to focus on your virtues.
You taught us that.
Tom can't come to work today because he's not feeling well.
I'm a terrible writer.
We could have achieved what we started earlier.
They live in a white house with a facade brick on the corner on the left at the end of the street.
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
It's too loud for me here.
I'm alone.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm really upset about it.
Tom's alone.
If she'd been a little more patient, she could have made it.
Whatever you do, don't laugh.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?
I don't understand why Tom would want to do that.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
I'm not sure what time I'm supposed to be there.
Don't open it.
Tom's already here.
I work at the hospital.
I already told Tom that.

Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I had lunch with him.
I'm tired of fighting.
Little kids don't know many words.
Where's she going?
Mary makes her living sewing.
Don't drink the water out of the dirty glass!
We won!
Tom ran in.
Where's Tom gonna sleep?
How does Tom do that?
All their efforts were in vain.
Did you get enough sleep last night?
Tom asked me if I wanted to go to Boston with him.
The only word written on the page was "frog."
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Do you speak Italian?
It wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
"Do you have a nickname?" "Yes, Rick."
I stayed.
Tom ate a slice of pie.
Who told you to write with your left hand?
You should have told me.
Don't exaggerate.
Nothing's working for me today.
Really?
This is Brian Rock.
You can do better than that.
Tom's not an expert.
We came to London to see a comedy.
Why are you alone?
Bribery government officials fled the country.
How much blood did the injured lose?
I don't want to bother you.
Two guys ran out of the room.
It's never too late to study.
Please come to my house for a while.
We have to find them first.
This one's pretty cool.
I have strong reason to believe that my son Sérgio Melo registered on Sunday, May 11, 2014, as 20,000 members!
I think that's just great.
Tom was very scared.
I speak Bosnian.
Are we almost there?
It's snowing.
I didn't recognize the tune.
I'm from Turkey.
Just tell me the truth.
You can't blame it all on Tom.
I didn't speak fluent French at the time.
I spent many evenings curled up in bed watching television.
There's a guard outside.
Do you have any rooms available?
Can I call around 2:30?
I'm really lucky about that.
Well, these things happen.
That's a nice sweater.
I don't really like Tom that much.
I didn't really want to do that.
Tom didn't see anything.
You're stupid.
Tom looked a lot different after the haircut.
Tom invited Maria to dinner.
We're not staying here.
Interesting.
Music, after silence, is what is most approximate inexplicable.
We walked all the way to the next station.
I have two daughters.
I really didn't have any money.
Tom ducked to hide.
Have courage.
Let's rest for five minutes.
I believe in science.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Don't complicate it, Tom.
She smiled.
Just give us a chance.
Be careful.
Tom's on stage.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
Have another one.
Two men were business partners.
I'm learning now.
I almost forgot my passport.

I read Chinese very well, but I can't write it very well.
I can write a note to Tom if you want.
Why don't you take your sweater off?
I wonder what Tom's up to.
I can't cheer him up.
There was a lot to eat.
This watch is cheaper than that.
Regular use of the aggro will reduce pores and refresh the skin.
Eve gave Adam an apple of knowledge.
Looks like most people only grill in the summer.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
When did you get home?
He asked me to help him.
This isn't true.
I took the first step.
This is easy.
I know as much as you do.
They're terrible.
They're just trying to help.
Tom told me he wanted to be a doctor.
I owe my father what I am.
Emily's English.
I asked him a lot of questions about ecology.
Why are you still up?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
I thought you were taking the Bosto bus.
Let's go for a walk.
Can you keep a secret?
I thought you already took care of it.
I remember everything.
Don't stop.
Tom's been shot three times.
Don't cheat.
You never know what might happen.
You do good to those who hate you.
I nodded once.
Hello, how are you?
He doesn't speak English.
What's your favorite TV star?
Tom's passed out.
How was your day?
He's not the kind of person who steals.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
We can talk about it in the future.
We won't let you down.
Don't waste words for nothing.
We don't get many visitors down here.
I love him, but he's often too sensitive.
She divorced her husband.
Many languages describe the death and death of eumephysms.
Did you do that on purpose?
Don't get caught.
I wish I could paint like that.
I'm loyal.
Tom likes cheese.
What did you tell Tom?
I know this is gonna cause you extra trouble, but there's nothing you can do.
You have to let it go.
What's your job?
Tom hasn't written to me in a long time.
Tom never told me what he wanted to eat.
Could you have read it?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Hello.
Tom's gonna make it.
Tom is living proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
Tom's a busy guy.
You look very pale.
This is a good textbook.
I've lost the flow of thought.
Do you speak Italian?
Tom took out some I.D.
You're embarrassing her.
My phone's about to go dead.
Tom convinced Mary to invite John to the party.
Wait, what are you trying to do?
Let's stretch our legs.
I'm going on a trip.
That'll be all for now.
Interesting, he's coming today?
The powerless must be protected before the mighty.
I don't know if your tongues are related.
I thought you'd be busy.
I want to rent a car, please show me the price list.
How long has the turtle lived?
Haven't you done enough?
I'm very optimistic about this.
I think Tom was trying to impress me.
They show up here to enjoy the fountain with ice, beer and a picnic basket.
Tom told me not to.
We went all the way to Boston together.
How long have you been a teacher?
Weapons manufacturers need to donate their money to organizations that can help countries in the war.
Do you think I should write to Tom?
We don't have that example.
We found footprints in the sand.
We ran out of construction.
How are you?
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
Mary is a very individualistic girl.
We can't let our emotions interfere with our actions.
She's my teacher.
Tom and I have been close friends for years.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
Tom knows what he likes.
Tom was very sleepy.
This building will be built in the city.
Come closer.
Come on!
What are you reading?
How many phone numbers does she have?
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
Don't go out tonight.
Don't strain yourself!
Can you wake me up at 7:00 tomorrow morning?
He always goes to work at 8:00 in the morning.
No controversy is ever finished, it will always surface again.
I eat a lot of meat.
I'm just an average girl.
Take it easy.
I'm a rookie.
This tea is good.
I miss you so much.
Cover your mouth while you cough, sneeze or yawn.
I'm ready.
I'm against the war.
He's walking.
He's got a nice patina on him.
Tom didn't give it to me.
Do you know how to disarm a bomb?
I've already tried that.
You're my mother.
Italy is not Greece.
I'm just not very happy.
I don't live in this town.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
I'll cooperate.
I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.
Give me an example.
Everything played out at the speed of light.
Fight!
That's really nice.
I've been called worse.
How did I miss that?
I'm not at all surprised.
I saved you a seat next to me.
Looks like the victim tried to write the killer's name with her own blood.
Being powerful is like being a lady, and if you need to tell people that you are, then you're not.
Tom might have something to do with it.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they say she's only with me for the night.
What's your story?
Where's Lori?
Were you in an accident?
I'll tell Tom if I don't forget.
I'm leaving.
I pissed him off.
That's very rare.
I pretended not to see it.
I tried to be nice.
Can you ask her to call me?
I pretended not to see it.
Have you seen my puppy?
It's getting dark.
Don't shout.
You know your rights.
You can't go in that room.
That's the point.
The whole town was underwater.
I didn't know where I was from.
Don't come in, I'm naked.
What do they call him?
Tom tried the button.
Can you pass the salt?
I'm ashamed my son did such a thing.
Success was only partial.
He always leaves for work at 8:00 in the morning.
I'm not 100 percent sure.
You wanna bet?
Tom didn't like the look of his nose, so he did a nose job.
Beth told Chris to take a bath or she won't go out with him.

Stop smoking.
The fuse's blown.
Don't answer that.

Ladies first.
It can't be hard; otherwise, women couldn't do it.
I'm glad people saw that.
She's not ugly.
I'm sick of his preaching.
No one would talk to me.
Piotr and Lech are also good friends.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I've got a gun.
We've been paid to the press.
Tom seems very nice.
We all live under the same sky, but we don't have the same horizon.
I can't imagine doing that.
My father has a good job.
He's got a good memory.
Tom has a good mentor.
I came back today.
Here's a little secret.
How much money does he make a month?
What a stupid question!
I'm restless.
We protested peacefully.
Maria was furious as hell.
Get up and introduce yourself, please.
We're all eager to see a movie.
You have to deal with your own problems.
Where do you live, Tom?
Satisfied he laughed.
Tom's got good notes.
That's no reason to panic.
I'm glad Tom won.
Tom was celebrating his reunion last week.
I'll sit at the table there.
Why are you so good at explaining things?
Turn left.
Who's first?
Don't say a word!
Your book is twice my book.
My third husband bought me this.
I know as much as you do.
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
I'm thorough.
Let's take a look.
Tom writes something in his diary every night, as tired as he is.
Were you planning something special?
My parents died.
Most scientists believe that this is caused by man's action, through the release of methane, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, since the time of industrialization, but still, several other scientists doubt this.
Will I be replaced?
Earth is a planet.
I can resist anything but temptation.
All you have to do is practice.
I paid for it.
Louder, please.
I didn't say I did it.
They know you.
You were right to worry.
I wish you'd keep an eye on my dog while I'm out.
I'm confused.
She's got a good heart.
Did you bring the fin?
How much time do I have left?
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
I'm not taking the job.
I'm intrigued.
Does that happen often?
You can't rely on Tom.
You look a little bit like Tom.
Everything's normal.
If you are.
Did you get the number?
You're under oath.
I passed out.
I wish I'd known.
I haven't seen you here before.
I don't think so.
It's about 300 miles from here to Boston.
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed.
Tom only managed to save a little money.
I'm leaving work early today.
Are you enjoying your work?
She was wearing a black hat.
Are you looking for anything in particular?
Her composition is very good, except for a few errors in the pronunciation.
English is considered an international language.
Don't worry!
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
I'm a monk.
I live in Boston right now.
Ania has black and Magdalena has blond hair.
Why did you decide to stop using Twitter?
I'm not a philologist.
Am I a suspect?
I could help.
For God's sake!
Haven't you done enough?
All animals are equal.
I doubt Tom's gonna give you the keys.
I didn't give anything.
I have a feeling it's gonna rain.
Caroline's sad because she can't get pregnant.
He's got a few friends.
Did you sleep?
I don't want meat.
What are you hiding now?
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Tom seems a little woozy.
I'm really happy about it.
Drive faster.
I'm trying.
I have no idea what he's talking about.
That's certainly no reason to worry.
I took off my wig.
My life was good.
That's my cat.
Here is a large amount of minor errors and petty misunderstanding that distort the meaning of the original sentence.
I haven't had any complaints so far.
I can ski.
He's standing right there.
Are you afraid of rats?
I was at the front desk.
He's known as a great painter.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
Now you're lying to me.
Did Tom ever answer you?
Go look for Tom.
Tom did his best.
Shoot the legs!
"Are you serious?" "I'm serious."
Why are you mad at me?
I'd prefer an appointment in the morning.
Tom didn't like the way Mary talked to him.
We have to find out.
You're sad.
What's your name in Bosnian?
Tom needs to learn more if he's going to graduate.
I'm tired of fighting.
I wrote a poem about what happened here last year.
I can't taste it!
It's too easy that way.
Where did that come from?
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Bears are very dangerous.
Really?
We know you're a coward.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
We had to call the police last night.
I'm worried about you.
Have they ever been in a car accident?
She's the Prime Minister of Finland.
Please come pick me up.
I like what you've done with the place.
She decided not to go.
Tom traveled to the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
You're lying!
It's a fish.
Tom already knew about it.
I did do it, didn't I?
No one noticed she was gone until the meeting was over.
She's honest.
Who's running the meeting today?
How did you find out where Tom was?
You're not rational.
These are my best friends.
It doesn't work for me.
Give me a day or two.
She confessed to everything.
Tom used to drive a bus.
Would you like some coffee?
Many birds move south in the fall.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
That article was written in English.
Some of you need help.
Sugar replaced honey as a sweetener.
You're about to make a big mistake.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll go.
What's all the fuss about?
Can you please turn off the radio for me?
There's a bus stop near our school.
Don't drink the water.
I'm adopted.
Nobody knows what's gonna happen next.
I've made up my mind.
Do you have a copy?
Next Monday and Tuesday are holidays.
Let's go to the movies.
I don't understand why they're such good friends.
Dan's a linguist.
I wouldn't hurt her.
This is a book.
In this phase of world history, there is no such thing as an independent press. You know that. There is no one among you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he wrote it, he would already know in advance that it will never appear in the press. I get a regular salary to keep my honest opinion out of the newspapers for which I work. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so mad as to write what he truly thinks, he would find himself out there, on the street, looking for another job. If I had allowed my true opinion to appear only in one edition of the newspaper that I work for, I would have been fired from work for less than 24 hours. The job of journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie, to pervert, to slander, to slander, to slander, to slander, to a monster in front of whose feet, to sell this and to our people, we know that we are not a living, and we know what we are, and what we know about.
I'm not worried at all.
The sleeping room is upstairs.
It's mine, not his.
I could use some help.
What's wrong with you?
I wasn't too surprised.
Tom couldn't get Mary to make a cake for John's birthday party.
Tom writes very well.
Tom frowned at himself.
I watched Tom die.
She hated him.
It's my favorite shirt, and I always wash it on my hands.
You kind of hinted you wanted me to ask you out.
It is recommended that you do not write down your passwords where others can see them.
That's so funny.
Look again.
How could I do that?
Did you eat anything?
Tom's been very supportive.
Silk's expensive.
What are you going to do today?
I'd rather not be involved at this stage, thank you.
It only happens occasionally.
I know your face.
Only I can do it here.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
I'd like to tell you the truth.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
If you're going out, please close the door.
I can't believe I forgot.
Taxi's expensive.
Open up.
Do you love your mother?
I didn't know much about Australia.
Tom's gonna be all right.
There's no use trying to convince him.
That's right.
Let's be friends.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
You'll probably never see me again.
The Milky Way is a vast belt of distant stars similar to our sun.
Who's that?
I could talk to Tom.
Naoko lives in a white house.
I thought you were happy here.
I thought Tom was doing well.
I could come with you.
I'm excited.
I invited him.
He's a man with great experience.
A beautiful blonde sunbathed on the beach.
Logic is clearly your strong suit.
We're trying.
Luckily, Tom wasn't seriously injured.
I need your help.
Stop!
The airline will see to it that it sends your luggage all the way to its final destination as soon as possible, or later if it wants a passenger.

The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest thorns.
What's this all about?
I'd like to kiss you.
He owned a lot of land once upon a time.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Tom laughed at the idea.
She was wearing intrusive clothes.
I'll be right there.
He was awfully thin.
I'm sorry.
What did she look like?
We can't go back.
He told me I was cute.
The Colosseum was used until 217. But then it was struck by lightning and burned.
My father's so old he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
How desperate are you?
It's time for you to go to sleep.
You're absolutely right.
I consider him an enemy.
You deserve it.
I'm working.
Does Tom have a lawyer?
You changed my life.
Can I have your dictionary?
He ran away from her.
If a man has the right to live, then he should have the right to die.
All the teachers were young and loved to teach.
Faith works wonders!
He was holding his breath.
Tom's a connoisseur.
Congratulations!
The bird on the roof is a crow.
My house is far away.
I've never really been anywhere.
We're in a difficult situation.
I'll check it out now.
Check again.
Come with us, please.
Sami's missing some board in his head.
You don't look so good.
What's the name of that restaurant?
How do I call a cab?
There's a lot of nice parks in London.
Tom was purple with anger.
I have a return ticket to Tokyo.
When did you get home?
They know you.
You didn't answer the question.
In this dictionary, 1,000 words are written and all of them must be remembered by July.
It's too loud for me here.
There's a good chance we'll win.
We have to go back.
Do you think it's possible to pass all your exams?
It would have been different.
They're all there.
Is that your car?
Did you bring the hair dryer?
He was bare-breasted and barefoot.
Did you talk about me?
Tom's gonna give up.
You got a headache?
I can ski.
What makes you say that?
It's snowing today.
You should write Tom a note.
My head hurts today.
She insisted that he go to the hospital.
I think Tom pulled out a thicker end.
That doesn't play any part anymore.
I'll do my homework tomorrow.
Get help.
Tom suffers from chronic pain.
By the way, where do you live?
Tom installed solar panels on the roof of his house.
I want you to find out if Tom and Maria are planning on being alone here.
He lives in England.
It's terrible down here.
Who wants to talk to me?
What a shock!
We tried to stop Tom.
Loving and being loved is the greatest happiness.
Screw you.
Guilty.
Who wants to talk to me?
Get some backup.
Bill's two years younger than me.
We just got here today.
Come stay with me.
Bring me her head.
I wasn't wearing any intrusive clothes.
I didn't think you'd want that.
When she was in Los Angeles, she had at least six different jobs.
You're embarrassing him.
Because of her physical flaws, Mary uses a walking stick when she's outside.
You can just tell us the truth.
The door to the office is yellow.
I think Tom needs help.
I'm not usually in the office on Mondays.
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
Lemon contains citric acid.
We'll never catch Tom.
I have a lot of friends.
Croatia was so beautiful.
I was tearing down the school.
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
We'll stop it.
Tom wants his money today.
Are you done washing the dishes?
Can I use your dictionary?
Is it yours?
You told me that before.
Are you being honest?
Tom didn't think Mary would have to do that.
Tom works as a waiter, but he's looking for a better job.
The road is direct.
I need more coffee.
The TV's not on.
The house is made of brick.
Everybody's lying.
Damn, can you imagine how much they smelled?
Do you love your mother?
You should get a new car now.
I took the first step.
I'm down here.
Be tolerant.
What happens next time?
Would you like some fruit juice?
Tom's the best student in the class.
I assumed you were busy.
Go away.
Tom changed his name.
Can you help us?
I wasn't nervous about it.
Are you going back now?
My name is Hashimoto.
It's comfortable.
He lost hope and killed himself with poison.
You were spying on me.
It's night, family dinner.
Better late than never.
We're never going back there.
Are we going home?
Even if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
I made a mistake this morning.
You can do better than that.
Is everything settled now?
Have you seen my dog?
Stay calm.
One day he'll be mine.
I have a few friends.
Give Tom a drink.
I've had enough!
He went in spite of her displeasure.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom could speak French.
I feel a sharp pain in my stomach.
You need to lie still.
That was terrible.
Can I replace this?
They didn't know me.
What a beautiful car!
There are islands at sea.
Are these ripe bananas?
You're sad.
You're very rude.
I could kill you right now.
The soldier woke Layla with a punch.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Tell me why you did it.
Can you drive me to the airport tomorrow morning?
Please, kick as hard as you can.
I won't let you do it.
I think I can save you some time.
Then I'll see what I can do!
Would you like some more tomato juice?
Maybe it's not enough.
Tom liked his job very much.
Are you done?
I agreed to buy it.
Can you come?
Yes or no?
Speaking English is fun.
Postmortem showed she was strangled.
Tom's gonna die.
It's pronounced like this:
It was serious.
How was your French class?
Someone probably told him, but it wasn't me.
Oslo is just unique.
No pain, no gain.
Stay positive.
The city was damaged during the war.
I pissed him off.
Give yourself some time.
Tom can't even write his own name yet.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you for the information.
What's your material status?
They need each other.
Was he wrong about that?
Take it easy, but hurry up.
Rumor has spread all over the city.
Time flies.
There's a Mr. Itoh here to see you.
The cat is not a man!
I'm good at a lot of things.
I don't like to be surprised.
Come here.
You should eat more vegetables.
The best way to lose weight is to eat less and exercise more.
It's gonna be a fun weekend.
What's your name?
Tom will think again.
It wasn't too cold.
Tom wrote me over 30 messages yesterday.
I hope he doesn't notice my mistake.
I bought a cactus.
Now I'm a little worried.
Now we need the truth.
Game's over.
Is that a bird?
Is breakfast included in the price?

We didn't do it.
Did you do the dishes?
A young man is a doctor.
Please pass the salt.
The spaceship was destroyed.
How does Tom do it?
Be careful.
Do you have any paper I can write on?
He was walking down the street.
Dogs are barking.
She came alone.
Do you agree with that?
Where's the museum?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw a cat.
Why is love so complicated?
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of the Christmas book sale, and it's hardly going to be taken off site by some book.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a fuss?
Sami's missing a board in his head.
I've got an old bike.
Did you do the dishes?
He didn't come to the last meeting.
Good morning!
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
Your secret is safe with us.
Am I wrong?
You need a hobby.
I assumed you were busy.
At the next intersection, turn right.
I told you it doesn't work.
You too, Brutus?
Are you dyslexic?
If only I'd known.
I often borrow books from Tom.
Change your clothes.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people have gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything is well prepared in advance.
That's not what I'm counting on.
I don't know what that is.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
He's poor but too proud to ask for help.
"Who's in the car?" "Maria."
They gave water to their horses.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I'll give you anything you want.
The girls wore grass skirts and had flowers around their necks.
Can you call a doctor?
The world is unjust.
Do you know she likes animals?
Tom's the only feeder in the family.
He may already be gone.
He started yelling.
Don't be rude to me!
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
You can format and configure the table for cross-calculations, insert and use regular tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.
I'm staying at the Hilton Hotel.
Which one of you will come with me?
Come to my house.
Call me anytime, on my shoulder, you can always cry.
I've been reformed.
What happens next time?
Mr. Wood came to the door and spoke to Tony's mother.
The doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one believed her.
He doesn't even speak French.
We watched the bird feed its young.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was sophisticated.
This sad story was written at the time Tom was in exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
She drinks like a fish.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Do you have anything to say?
Change your clothes.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
He dressed like a woman.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You shouldn't send that email.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Can you prove that?
Dead end.
It's so easy to write with this pen.
Tom called his hamster Cookie.
Are you ready for more?
Don't change your mind so often.
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me play?
I don't like to learn in this heat.
I'd rather not be involved in this right now.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
There's nothing to do in this village.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play guitar.
He's a man of experience.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what they both like.
It must have been terrible.
Your plan sounds great.
You sound surprised.
I'll lend you a workbook if you promise not to write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house I do.
There's a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find him?
Are they in love?
Where do you want to meet tomorrow?
The house is in his possession.
Tom was saved by Mary.
What do we want?
Tom's deaf as a cannon.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think everyone's ready.
"Have you seen my phone?" "It's on the table."
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Have you eaten anything?
Let's get this straight.
The shigly is a very interesting bird.
There's no point in waiting.
Liaison between personality and blood type has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
The cat came out from under the table.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
Your house is big.
Even if you spend a lot of time in there, you can practice lifting your knees as high as you can when you're walking or walking in a place.
You're everything to me.
I want to get married.
Hold my backpack.
I did check some things out.
Tom knew Maria didn't like him.
I'm not singing.
It was love at first sight.
I'd like to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Are you coming soon?
Many young Romans have gone to Greece.
The plan was rejected as impractical.
I don't want to go to school.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
The data transfer task force, led by Ben Mani, will hold a meeting on 14 January 1999.
Some say if you step on a rainworm, it'll start raining.
In my beginning, it's my end.
I just got here.
I have to go to the mosque.
I mean, so I did.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Sami used to talk to young women.
What am I supposed to see?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Don't strain yourself!
Tom can knock really fast.
I can't answer that right now.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
I want a sword like this!
Identify yourselves.
Take the money.
Tom still looks surprised.
I'm saving up to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up like that.
He soon recovered from the shock.
I give you what you want.
It's pure escapism.
Who did you write the letter to?
I might need some help.
Karin is Austrian.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm tougher than I look.
No one came.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
You're sad.
Tom bought the paper and read it on the train.
Focus your camera on the flower.
I won't be home next week.
As a child, I often visited him on Sundays.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be okay.
What do you call it?
Welcome back.
How does Tom know French?
I like watching you work.
Answer me now.
There's no policy.
Write down what I tell you.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
The redheads are driving me crazy!
Do you love your mother?
He finally fulfilled my request.
There was a big explosion.
Tom winked.
I didn't set foot outside today.
Did they give you a reason?
Can you spell your name for me?
Look at this.
I have an aunt who lives in Kyoto.
She was saving her life.
What wine do you have?
Do you think she did it?
I think we should call a doctor.
Life in Tokyo is very expensive.
You're awfully early today.
We caught Tom red-handed.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't happy with the results.
I hid under the table.
They're holding me hostage.
I think this is obvious.
Emma was very conspicuous at the party.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Tom asked Mary how she liked her new job.
I'm a big football fan.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary makes a living sewing.
Can you pass the water, please?
Where's your friend?
The terrorists have released the hostages.
I don't know what to make of this.
I don't like it at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Tom asked Maria if he could borrow her English textbook.
We've come for you.
Call security!
My scarf is blue.
The ground is too small.
I'm intrigued.
What do you believe in?
What do you want?
Most of the drugs don't have to be mixed with alcohol.
There's a bakery next to the butcher shop.
Did you see who it was?
Try this.
When I woke up, it was snowing.
Some people, no matter what age they're in, don't lose their beauty.
Tom's got a Russian sentence.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
That's pretty amazing.
Tom shrugged his shoulders.
Bad things are gonna happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Investigate her.
I'm very impressed.
She was dressed in red.
I should talk to my father about it.
What does a sovetologist study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Where's the dog?
Are you fully recovered?
We had a big fight.
Tom's still hiding.
How are you?
We're the same strain.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
Keep working.
Hope is lost when you're experiencing a difficult situation and pointless safety.
I was laughing.
You have to stop smoking.

Tom didn't seem to be doing what he was supposed to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dance?
You better shut up!
Tom and Mary have decided to adopt John.
The baby's asleep.
Have you eaten anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
He's not a child anymore.
We're almost done.
Is it clear?
They haven't woken up yet.
It's all free.
Welcome.
We have no other choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
My friend was shocked when I told her.
I think Tom could do it.
I'm thinking about going to Australia too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are Americans really that individual?
I asked Tony a question.
You can go play with your friends when you finish cleaning the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
Tom came to Mary's birthday party.
What's your specialty?
He couldn't help laughing at her jokes.
She freed the bird from the cage.
I'm twice Tom's age.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary and he couldn't have influenced it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
I wasn't too surprised.
I saw him pull something like a pot out of a box.
What's your name in Bosnian?
Do you know how this machine works?
Tom managed to find a job in Boston.
You're my happiness.

Thank you so much for everything!
I've never been camping.
There are a lot of dishonest people in the world.

The cat is not a man!
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
Hungarian isn't easy, but it's wonderful.
I don't really watch TV.
I love France.
He's good.
Did you know that?
I think so, too.
Are you ready?
The money's talking.
He's my rival at work.
I prefer a tent with a storm cover, along with crossbars for stability in the wind and snow, and this has to be a two-layer tent.
Tell Tom I said hi.
That's very sensitive.
This is my wife Edith.
I can't be something I'm not.
She lost money, family, friends.
Now introduce yourselves by using these sentences!
My name is not 'you'; it's Ricardo.
Where do we meet?
We need to consider all options.
I hope this never happens again.
There's a good chance it's going to rain tomorrow.
You're driving me crazy.
You don't need my permission.
I remember everything.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
It's got a nice flower, but it doesn't produce fruit.
I'm touched.
Tom told me to knock on the door.
Tom's been fired.
Are you planning on going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is significantly better compared to his predecessor.
Don't call me while I'm at the office.
Who bought this for you?
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor is questioning the patient.
Tom laid down his drink.
This is a travesty of justice.
I could lose my pension.
She's in a bad mood.
It doesn't matter where I am.
I've always known that.
Don't stare.
You have very penetrating eyes.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about it.
I've never been camping.
They believe in God.
When the cat's gone, the mice get in the water.
Everyone's the boss in their own house.
Let's hope you're right.
We split up on the corner.
Are you angry about that?
I've baked a tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could rely on Tom.
Open!
When there's no news, that's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did I drop that?
No one died.
Did you sleep?
I'm deaf and mute while I'm eating.
They tried each other hard in court.
My name is Sally.
I don't practice.
Is there a reason you keep these old bottles?
We talked for a while.
I have to go now.
Can I have your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That fabric isn't from India, is it?
Who are you?
Tomorrow I'll buy what I need.
I may be antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're being honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Don't yell at me.
They spoke ill of the captain while he was gone.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started learning French last year.
Tom sat on the bench all day, writing postcards.
I've got two cats.
There's no need for words.
Aren't you going to eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
He's always talking about a government with contempt.
Money talks.
Tom's new girlfriend is very young.
I don't understand this word.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Tom told me his father died.

I've never noticed that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?

I'm too old for this.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
Yeah.
I love this store.
I'm about to come looking for you.
He leads a rough life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
I've lost the flow of thought.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom's got the right attitude.

Where'd you get the keys?
I won't tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little woozy.
I saw the bus.
It's no big deal.
Tom's wise enough not to do something like that.
I brought these reports for you to take a closer look at.
I'm not as rich as we'd like.
Can I kiss you?
Get aboard.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
Tom's still pissed.
How do I know you won't turn me in after I help you?
What are you still doing up?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Maria put on her coat.
Have fun while you can.

I could come with you.
Unfortunately, he crossed over to become a powerless, dirty, small and insignificant man in the corner of a small province in a vast empire.
We should do better.
Weather forecast says it's going to rain tomorrow afternoon.
Tom's a real gentleman.
These are very old books.
I saw a snake.
It's useless.

Are you listening?
Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat something?
Give me another reason.
I'm proud of you.
He was born in a small town in Italy.
What did you two do?
Is this your first test?
Life goes on!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Okay, we have a deal.

How old is this book?
That's enough for today.
I'll just say, you're beautiful.
Are you allergic to any food?
They listen to Tom because he's convincing.
My suitcase's not packed yet.
Did you sleep?
I don't see the difference.
This is my computer.

The readers were struggling, waiting at least three months before they got an answer.
Do you know anyone who passed last year's exam?

They live high.
That fox must have killed the chicken.

I'm sure I've seen this guy somewhere before.
I'm surprised at Tom's answer.
Where's the museum?
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
I almost forgot my passport.
You don't support me much.

Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
You never get there in time.
What's that?
A man's dreaming, God's determining.
Exactly when did you do it?
Someone probably told her, but it wasn't me.
Tom was wearing black jeans.
That must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
This is a book.
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art than science.
Is this seat taken?
It was just like that.
Add more water.

Why are you leaving?
Now it's time to enjoy it.
Has he fulfilled his goals?
Karin is Austrian.
Give me the milk.
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my puppy?
I have a book.
What do your kids usually have for breakfast?
Am I that different?
We had a terrible fight.
In this phase of world history, in America there is no such thing as independent press. You know that. Among you there is no one who dares to write his honest opinion out of the paper that I work for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what he truly thinks, would be out there, in the street, looking for some other job. If I had allowed myself to appear in any less than 24 hours of work, I would have been able to get my right to do what I would have done for less than 24 hours.
Tom's a salesman, too.
I'm twice Tom's age.
That's exactly what I said would happen.

Tom looks a little squeamish.
I wish my wife could cook.
I'm proud of my family.
Men have about 7 to 8 times more testosterone than women.
He's got eyes in the back of his head.
That's a bad sign.
I have to go.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Don't argue with me!
It was a good hat.
Would you like some tea or coffee?
He doesn't want to lose a whole week.
The door's stuck for something.
She probably did it yesterday.
Tom left right away.
I had lunch with her.
At school, we learn to read and write.

Are you dyslexic?
This is a book.
It doesn't work on me.
The assembly is adjourned.
I'm starving.
I love bread.
I'm just doing my duty.

You're so messed up.

The Haskell Free Library and Opera House were built on the border between Canada and the United States.

It's very important to rest properly.
I'm disappointed in you.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Karin is Austrian.
I think I understand.
Tom's personal assistant has a personal assistant.
It was sitting alone.
Who cares?
Like father, like son.
We're talking about the wolf, and the wolf's at the door.
You have to make a decision.
Anyone can do that?
Every time we talk, he makes my adrenaline work.

The boy is thin.
It's a routine thing.
He never got over his son's death.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will somebody tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than me.
Nothing works for me today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing a good job.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom hit the switch.
My kids need me.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn't read it because it was too small.
Of course, Tom's wrong.

So this is how it ends?
What's this?
I'll take the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
He sleeps like a baby.
I'm taking the day off.
Do you blame me?
That doesn't like me.
That ruined the mood at the table yesterday.
Stay in the house.
I thought you were going to Boston by bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Fuck you!
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
You're wasting your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had trouble sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll think of something.
