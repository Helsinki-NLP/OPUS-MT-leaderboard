Welsh members of the congregation are concerned about similarities with the Muppets
Some members of the congregation are overwhelmed by the proposal to change their title to "members of the Welsh Parliament" (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the congregation to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this could make them a laughing stock.
A labor member of the congregation said his group is concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wells: In Welsh twp means silly, and pwp means feces.
A member of the assembly from the political party Plaid said the group as a whole "is not satisfied" and proposed alternative names.
A member of the Welsh conservative party said his group was "open" on name changes, but noted that there was a small difference between the terms MWP and Muppetovac.
In this context the pronunciation of Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of letters in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on the draft law on the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of members of the assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
In 2017, the Law of the government of Wales gave the assembly the authority to change its name.
In June, the commission announced the results of a public debate on proposals that resulted in great support for the appointment of the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of members of the Assembly, the commission preferred the name of members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the congregation reportedly make alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could give headaches to the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft law on change within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the Commission system plan.
Members of the congregation will have one last chance to vote on their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians to referendum on state name change
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
A national vote is organised in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece that has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is the property of its territory and is persistently opposed to its requirements for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite amending the name, said he would not recognise the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that changing the name is simply the price they must pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells at St. Martin's are silent as the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The older people I talked to said there used to be bars and churches at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there is neither."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People hang out differently today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living quarters that people go to regularly."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of property won't last as long as the executives expect, "and sooner or later, he'll go back to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who will not help preserve the remaining neighborhood shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that will speed up the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original community of white Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The black community that worshiped nearby took possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson who led a boycott of traffickers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting black men.
In 1939, the fire damaged the building very badly, but as Father Johnson's pastors made a renovation plan, they ordered an organ.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ "the bells of the poor".
An expert who played the organ in July called them something else: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Tiffany Ng of Michigan University also pointed out that these are the first organ in the world played by a black musician, Dionissio A. Lind, who moved to a larger organ at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church couldn't find him a replacement.
What took place at St. Martin's Church in the last few months is a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were brought by church heads and other bishops.
The bishop's administration – the governing body of the diocese, composed of church heads – wrote to the diocese in July, voicing concern that the diocese would "try to transfer the costs" to the bishop's administration, although the bishop's administration was not included in the lease of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
A shark hurt a 13-year-old boy during a lobster hunt in California.
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the day of the lobster hunt, officials said.
The attack occurred just before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach Beach Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday, he and his friends were diving for about half an hour when he heard a boy calling for help and then he rowed to him with the group and helped them get him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was the excitement of catching lobster, but then "he realized he was yelling 'She bit me!'
She bit me!
His entire collarbone was torn apart," Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'The shark is in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to a pediatric hospital called Rady's where his condition is considered critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that the shark had already been spotted in the area several weeks earlier, but it was determined that it did not belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper hull area.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach Beach in Casablad to Swami's Beach in Ecinitas for a 48-hour period for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's becoming competition with chains Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to departments of cosmetic products in the style of department stores where professional assistants work.
As part of a significant penetration into the £2.8 billion UK beauty market, which is on the rise as fashion and home equipment markets go down, larger cosmetic departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be expanded to more stores next year if successful.
Investment in cosmetic products occurs because supermarkets find ways to use shelves used for TVs, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its cosmetic range by offering more than 3,000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of products of brands L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in departments similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket will also restart its line of Boutique makeup by making most of the products suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test the retail outlets at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second one will open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and moving towards daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local stores means supermarkets must make additional efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury's chain, said stores would look more and more like department stores in the supermarket's bid to fight back with chains with great discounts to Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened departments of the Argos store in hundreds of its shops, and has also introduced Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, saying it has increased the sale of food products and the profitability of procurement.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to modernise their cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments ended unfamiliarly.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended with a fight over the division of pharmacy income in their stores.
The new strategy came into effect after Sainsbury's sold his 281 pharmacy to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceuticals chain for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds is said to play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury skin care products to four stores to their range, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial manager of Sainsbury's chain, said, "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beauty departments to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now the inevitable destination of the beauty market that sets new standards compared to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million-pound deal.
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, is "furry" after television host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement with his personal £11 million brand to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home and accessories Truly.
The company of this couple is compared to the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning (37) announced its departure through Instagram.
Holly Willowby pissed off the Dragons' Dan Peter Jones star by pulling out of their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on her new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "mad" when the golden girl of television confessed, during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant there was no more time to devote to their brand of home and additional equipment Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of his summer homes.
The source said, "Holly put Truly at the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would ensure her earnings over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has stunned everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of products ready to sell at Marlowe headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, which was among the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothes and home equipment, and possible additional delays in launch dates.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cappov in 2016, and Jones (52) joined March as CEO of the company.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anto McPartlin as head of the I'm A Celebrity I' TV show.
A source close to Jones last night said, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, ‘and then we fell in love’
He joked about the criticism he could get from the media over comments that could be characterised as "unprecedented" and a positive stance on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said with his funny voice, "the newsreader."
"I didn't give in at all."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump declared their first June meeting in Singapore as a major step forward to denuclearising North Korea.
But the denuclearisation talks have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an "adequate response" by the US on the original steps of North Korea towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were one step away from the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have great relationships."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results -- by suspending missile testing, releasing hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers.
And he stood up for his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to behave presidentially, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After an earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the island's population has been removed, the state of national disaster has not been declared, a precondition for obtaining international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they are not seeking international help, so it will be quite difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to the Palu, they are still not sure whether foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation on the island of Palu to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in assistance.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, it is sad how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently, there was no tsunami siren on the island of Palu, although the warning was in effect, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between numerous Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is on its way to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of a new accident.
President Yoko Widowo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds hit Mr. Yoko's administration as he expects a new election next year.
Mr. Yoko is also under pressure because of long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced because of street fights between Christian and Muslim groups, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look: Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge has scored a deep tie against Chelsea Football Club.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing in the Premier League hit at 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal club while his team was losing 1:0.
He moved the ball to his left, and then he kicked it to the outside post.
The ball flew high above the penalty area turning to the top right corner of the net.
In the end, she fell over Cap Arrizabalg who was in the jump and fell into the net.
"It was only until positioning, until receiving the ball, and players like Shaq always go forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time," Sturrudge told Liverpool.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea ran 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In that attack, the Blue Attacker passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic with his heel before he ran from the middle of the field to Liverpool's half.
Kovacic quickly touched and returned the ball in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, leading Hazard into the criminal area.
Hazard was faster than the defense, and he ended up near the stand by putting his left foot in the net past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the group phase of the Champions League at three o'clock Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays Videoton in the League of Europe at three o'clock on Thursday in London.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims reached 832
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported buried in the ruins of buildings that were demolished by a 7.5 earthquake that took place Friday and raised waves of up to 20 feet high, said the spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered in remains of broken buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was stabbed to death.
There was an investigation into the murder after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead this morning in the Merseyside area.
Forty-four-year-old girl was found stabbed at 7:55 in the morning at Grayson Mews on John Street Street, and a 30-year-old male was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called people who have seen or heard anything nearby to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the early stages, but I'm calling everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car control cameras, to contact us as they may have information relevant to the investigation."
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know their wife arrived at the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police have said they are in the process of informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The tenants are now told that they will have to wait for hours before they are allowed back inside.
They heard a police officer tell one man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
She kept saying, "This is so horrible."
At 2:00 P.M., two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van right next door.
A large number of police officers were inside the police cordon monitoring the apartment building.
All those who have any information are invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 citing the 247 of September 30th.
Cromwell's statue in parliament became the latest monument amid a quarrel over "History Review"
Its removal would represent poetic justice for the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England performed by its puritanic followers.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "try to revise history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's image in front of the Westminster Palace also became a target.
Cromwell did not order or conduct iconocurrency during the English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the work of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a character that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, to protect parliament from external pressures, in his case monarchy.
Whether this is entirely true is the subject of a permanent historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid - 17th - century conflict shaped further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of fame and remembrance."
The killer pig inflicted deadly injuries on a Chinese farmer.
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man, only known to have been named Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood in a pigsty in a market in the town of Liupanshui in the Guizhou area, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig pig was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines in a piglet on May 30th 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai area, China.
Apparently, he arrived with a relative from the neighbouring Yunnan area on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to the neighbor's pigsty was open.
He said there was a big man pig in the pigsty with blood around his mouth.
Forensic investigation confirms that the pig weighs 550 libra inflicted fatal injuries on the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and dismembered," Guiyang Evening News quoted a relative who identified himself as Wu, as saying.
The security camera log shows Yuan arriving at the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market owners are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have been reported before.
A pig attacked her wife and her husband in 2016 on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, a 650 libra pig impaled a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife frightened her away.
After pigs ate an oregano farmer in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playing.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread showers in the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods due to showers all over northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States over the next few days.
Rosa's first-class hurricane winds reached a speed of 85 miles per hour from five o'clock in the morning in eastern time on Sunday, and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there's a gap forming in the Pacific Ocean and it's moving east and west coast of the United States, as the tropical storm of Rosa approaches Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture along with the coming gap will create widespread showers in the southwest in the coming days.
Places 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, rainfalls, and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical moisture will result in rainfalls that will reach between 2 and 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in the southwest areas, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of the rapid deterioration of weather conditions and the typical dispersal of tropical rain.
Walking into the desert would be extremely reckless at the risk of tropical rains.
The abundant rain in the canyons could result in raging rivers, and the thunder in places with strong winds and a sandstorm.
The coming gap will bring a bit of rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation of more than half an inch may be possible, which could cause nanoforms and slippery Augusts.
This will be the first rain wet season in the region.
A scattered tropical shower will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later Monday and Tuesday.
The showers will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue all Wednesday.
In October there can be massive temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder and the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
There is an excellent example of a dramatic temperature difference in the Central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remnants of summer heat will try again to accumulate and expand.
The beginning of October will be warm in most of the central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures of about 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast announces a high possibility of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's exciting testimony before the high court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political repulsion continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular broadcasts due to Friday's latest plot: the deal that Arizona Senator Jeff Blake made with the FBI's one-week investigation into the prosecution.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Commission that he was 100% sure he was drinking Kavanaugh's hands off and trying to get his clothes off at the high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company's computers are CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other networks broadcasting this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network channels.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty listing people who monitor the transfer from the office.
To better illustrate, it's an audience similar to the one that follows football elimination matches or Oscar awards.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, ran ahead of other networks with an average number of viewers of 5.69 million during the day's hearing, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest is high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of the play on Friday.
After a moderate Republican's office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded footage of protesters yelling at him after he tried to enter the elevator to attend a judicial hearing.
He was standing there with his eyes down for a few minutes while being insulted, with a live feed on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told: ‘You have power while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, there was more to say at the commission hearing.
Cable and television networks had a live broadcast hours later as the judicial commission voted whether to forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do it on condition that the FBI investigates charges against the appointed next week, which is called by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice was significant because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In a second interview next to hers on the front page of the daily, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Great Britain and the EU take customs duties from each other is "absolutely absurd".
The murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, a suspect in the death of an LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU club.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, police department Baton Rouge said.
Officials released a video of an altercation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
The police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports the CBS WAFB network.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail is $350,000, the lawyer said.
East District coroner's office issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot to the head and neck.
The department said the credits belong to the police task force for the fugitives of Louisiana, the state police crime labs, the Southern University police and the residents of the area who helped during the investigation leading to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva club thanked the district law enforcement agency for "the diligence and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot assailant and 6 inches tall grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU Club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per match.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of the LSU Will Wade Club said the team was "difficult" and "shocked" because of Wayde's death.
"This is what we constantly worry about," Wade said.
Volcano is dropping ash all over Mexico City.
The ash that spits out the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Protection Centre warned the Mexicans Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity in the crater increased even after 183 gas and ash emissions were registered in 24 hours.
The center followed multiple earthquakes and rumblings.
Pictures on social media show a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City districts like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased volcanic activity 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
A volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protesters, independence supporters, clashed with a special squad of police, when thousands joined the anti-demonstrations marking the anniversary of the polarising Catalan seceding referendum.
A group of masked separatists, detained by a special squad of police, threw eggs and powdered colors at them, making dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later in the day, clashes broke out with police who used their batons to contain the fight.
The supporters of independence spent hours chanting "No forgetfulness, No forgiveness" and clashed with the supporters of the union who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries they sustained in the protests, local press reported.
Tensions are still high in the region that opted for independence one year after the October 1st referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
Voters chose independence by a vast majority, although turnout was low because the opponents boycotted the referendum.
According to information from the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop a vote of violent clashes across the region.
Groups advocating independence camped Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narcisse Termes (68), an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they were allowed to vote, but we are in a tight spot now," he said.
Although they have taken a key but tight victory in the local elections last December, the Catalan parties that advocated independence have had difficulty maintaining momentum because some of their most famous leaders are in a self-imposed exile or in custody, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a forty-two-year-old mechanic who recorded a police support protest on the phone, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriole Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since late last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidating in the European elections is the best way to condemn the fallback of democratic values and repression imposed on us by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving a car into a house
Three men (33, 34, and 39) were arrested after driving multiple times into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent Street Thursday around 7:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings stated that the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at some point the car was shot from a crossbow.
The Menge Score won Livingston 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menge's first goal secured a win for Livingston.
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and recorded only the second loss for Steven Gerrard in the 18 matches of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menge's goal was crucial, while Gary Holt's club was tied to Hibernan in second place.
Gerrard's club has not recorded a single victory in the Premier League this season and will play against the first-placed Hearts, which is eight points behind next week.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid from Vienna in the European League match Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended a series of league victories to six matches, and head coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against guests who lacked acuity.
Holt's team was supposed to be in the lead long before they scored because their direct game was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made it through, but his attempt went past the goal, and then Alan Lithgrow's attempt went past the goal after he slipped in to take the ball Craig Halkett's head to the goal.
It suited the hosts to allow the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for guests from free kicks.
And that's how a key goal was scored.
There was a free kick against the Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson created an opportunity together for Manga, who took the ball and hit it from the middle of the criminal area.
Until that moment, the Rangers dominated the ball, but the host's defense remained impenetrable and goalie Liam Kelly didn't have much trouble.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morellos.
Scott Pittman was stopped by the goalie Ranger Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was kicking too wide from another free shot to Livingston.
Crosses were constantly arriving in Livingston’s criminal space and constantly defended, while the two penalty points they were looking for – one after foul against the replacement player Glenn Middleton, and the other because of the hand game – were not awarded.
"The Awesome Game" Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni Arena
Awesome game and the result of Livingston.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on the upward trajectory.
Their game style and players have almost not changed since their return to the top, but great credit belongs to Holt who has been giving the team energy since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a great organized defense, until Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worral through the whole match.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were once in a while under Gerrard's bat, they didn't reach that level.
The final blows were missing – they only broke through the host lines once – and this is the kind of wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of a smile and a blue sky as Turkey and Germany's leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at repairing NATO allies' relations.
They differed on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city where the largest number of Turks live outside Turkey.
Police cited security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors who oppose Erdogan -- many of them Kurds -- were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
Double protests reflect the split in the opinions of a guest whom some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others resent him for being an autocratist.
Car accident in Deptford: Biker died in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car accident in London.
There was a collision near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford, southeast of town, about 10:15 British time.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance team intervened, but a man was killed instantly.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died in an accident in which the driver left the scene of an accident on Childers Street Street, about a mile from the scene of a Saturday accident.
London P.D. said they're working on identifying the victim and informing the family.
The streets are closed, buses are rerouted, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in riots in a high security prison for men, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison, in Worcestershire County, Sunday around 9:30 British time and still last.
A special squad of Tornado officers was called in to calm the riots involving eight wards in one wing of the prison.
Officials suffered minor facial injuries and assistance was provided on the spot
The prison administration spokesman said, "We have deployed specially trained prison personnel dealing with an incident under way at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received medical attention due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that those responsible will be forwarded to the police and could be extended prison sentences."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the state.
In June, it was announced that the prison warden was admitted for hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, a special squad was called to prison for serious riots in which the staff were attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which may be useful in areas affected by drought)
Rarely tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is exactly what will very likely happen at the beginning of next week as Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert southwest regions with its remaining energy, carrying the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will be announced by rain Monday evening.
The National Weather Authority in Phoenix tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Centre for Hurricanes predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, it will most likely be 1 to 2 inches and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In areas where there is no fear of floods, Rosa's rain may be a blessing because the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls will probably be useful because the southwest is currently affected by drought.
According to information from the US drought surveillance agency, a little over 40 per cent of Arizona was affected at the very least by extreme drought, the second highest category," Weather.com said.
First, on his way, Hurricane Ross will lead to a landslide on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have the power of a hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and it will start to submerge.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with the power of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
The showers in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a great risk of flooding.
"Total rainfalls from three to six inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and perhaps even 10 inches," Weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico with the power of a tropical storm before reaching Arizona early Tuesday morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and South Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her behind are the great showers in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the American southwest desert," the National Centre for Hurricanes said.
These showers are expected to cause life-threatening floods and debris in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Assault: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old male were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 a.m. British time.
He's been taken to the hospital and he's in stable condition.
Seventeen-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area, the Avon and Somerset police said.
Officials are urging those who have any recording of the events on their mobile phones.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and rage" of the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a rally in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and rage" of the democratic party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the glow, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most realized legal minds of our time, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly touched the appointment of Kavanaugh as he discussed the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
Although I am not running personally, I am actually running," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claims the Democrats are trying "to resist and interfere".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not later than Friday, a senior Republican party official for CNN said.
Hundreds lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them picked up by huge waves that hit the beaches, when the great earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when the waves hit the coast at dusk, taking many to their deaths and destroying everything they could find in their path.
Tsunami was followed by a 7.5 earthquake.
"When the danger of tsunami was announced yesterday, people still dealt with their business on the beach and did not immediately escape, and they were injured," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency, in a address in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it carried cars, logs, houses, it hit everyone on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800km per hour (497 miles per hour) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palu.
The aerial photographs, issued by the disaster agency, show a multitude of destroyed buildings and shops, bent and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The tremors continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city located on the edge of the long, narrow bay has increased the power of tsunamis, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "much" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels were demolished.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be greater along the coast 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely cut off without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticised for failing to report that the tsunami had hit Pala, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
Amateur records distributed on social networks show a man on the top floor who alarms the people on the street below in panic about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes the wall of water hit the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused power cuts that cut off communications around Palu making it difficult for the authorities to rescue.
The army began sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacues still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been re-opened for humanitarian flights only and will be closed by October.
President Yoko Widowo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims has risen above 800.
It's very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization arrived safely from Donggala, Palo, where employees were placed in tents erected in the courtyard of the office, they witnessed scenes of destruction on the road, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to make the first steps in the relief of disaster, there were complaints that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to the Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, an influx of foreign funds, supplies and people is only possible if the crash site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster of the province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'okay, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international aid, but this status has not yet been declared."
As the second night of earthquakes and tsunamis fall at Pala on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and their shocking story in this natural disaster will be eased.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was buried under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, coached two missing paragliders ahead of the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
"As an older member of the paragliding team, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the paraglider circles, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to competitors in Palu who participated at the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one gray handle, instead of two blue handles.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 while charging ATMs at Newport on the Levee complex.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM worker at Newport on the Levee, according to Newport police report.
The car driver was emptying the ATM at an amusement complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing the scene, according to a statement, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
A rapper named Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
By announcing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It will be previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been known as Ye for some time and has used the title for its eighth album, published in June.
A change came before his performance at the Saturday Night Live, where his new Yandhi album is expected to be promoted.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande who cancelled the performance for "emotional reasons", the author said.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional name, West earlier said that this word has a religious significance for him.
"I believe that ‘yes’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’," West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with Radio Manager Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It came from Kanya, which means only Ye – which is a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West associate, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without dashes and capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico swore he wouldn't use the army against civilians
Mexico President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use the army to conquer the Mexican people".
The military fired at peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education were pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field, said investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the US government issued announcements about artificial intelligence, although the United States generally lacks an official strategy in the domain of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: its goal is to be first in the field of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, considering that all other countries are much behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the domain of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funds could double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Superforces of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that proved superior to the highest ranking American Othello player, and later he was CEO at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee acknowledged earlier technological competitions by the US government such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when they were planning the next competitions where future visionaries might be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to make enormous efforts to obtain government subsidies, Lee said.
"We are not taken away by China's academic leaders, by corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have recently hired great individuals from the university to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen their efforts in the domain of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer green cards to PhDs from the domain of artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan for developing new generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants subsidies to people in academic institutions in a similar manner to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Department of Defence formed a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence that seeks to involve partners from industry and academic community, and the White House announced the formation of an Electoral Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100m a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, US legislation that has sought to form a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians Vote in referendum on State Name Change
Macedonian citizens voted in Sunday's referendum to change the country's name in "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve the decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO Alliance.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims its northern neighbour's name is its property and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents claim this could jeopardise Macedonia's ethnic identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has asked whether a minimum of 50 per cent of what it takes to make the referendum valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you for NATO membership and the EU with acceptance of the deal with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, is worth paying to enter bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live freely within the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgievska (79) said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs said they would be managed by the result of the vote and the result would be decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when a total of 66 per cent of voters came to the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Jose Tanevski (62), a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in a Macedonian referendum to change their name, which could pave their way for NATO membership and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30th 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and dragged chairs in front of tents crucified by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads raised, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but proud country.
If they do not want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much needed investments in Macedonia whose unemployment rate is higher than 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will vote 'for' because more than 80 per cent of our population is for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the ballot was inserted.
He said the "for" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published Monday at the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says there will be between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters in the referendum -- below the required turnout.
According to a second poll conducted by Macedonian Thelma TV, 57 per cent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd vote yes.
A 50 per cent turnout plus one vote is required for the referendum to be successful.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came into power last May.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes through Brighton's entire defense and scores.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling got rid of Brighton's defense in a 2-0 Manchester City victory against Brighton at Etyhod Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero scored at 65 minutes.
The Argentinean assailant received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three defensive players in Brighton before he found himself on open ground.
Aguerra was then surrounded by three green uniforms.
He made it through one defensive player and he was faster than a few on the edge of Brighton's goal.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English assailant used his first blow in the criminal area to bring the ball back to Aguer, who overpowered Brighton Matthew Ryan's goalie with his right boot to the right side of the net.
"Aguero had some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave the sky blues a head start in the Premier League mess.
He scored in 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's field.
He beautifully added Leroy Sanne to his left flank.
Sanne touched it several times before sending Sterling to the goal.
The skyless assailant threw the ball into the net before it slipped off the field.
City fights Hoffenheim in the 12:55 Champions League group phase at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim on Thursday, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game with no competitive significance against the Rockies.
Since Nationals was eliminated in the Eliminator's game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But competitive Scherzer hopes to take a position on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a game of leverage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, are still in the game.
Rockies at least have a direct pass for winning 5:2 against the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the first league title.
"Even though we're not playing for anything, at least we can get out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams will probably be at the highest level of all these years.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
The Nationals still need to announce the starting team for Sunday, but they're supposed to be willing to let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, to whom it would be the 34th time to start the match, trained on Thursday and will pitch on Sunday when he usually rests.
Washington's right-winger leads 18:7 this season for an average deserved wounds of 2.53, 300 stopsuts in 2202/3 innings.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia.
The president briefly addressed the situation over his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' half-seat elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
We are five weeks from the most important choices of our lives.
These are one of the great, great – although I did not run, I am actually a candidate because everywhere I fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "Look at these horrible, horrible groups of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power using all kinds of ways, you see mean, dirty games.
They don't care who they hurt, who they run over to get power and control, power and control are what they want, and we will not give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resistance and interference".
"And you've seen it in the past four days," he said, calling Democrats "infuriated, vicious, evil and dishonest."
He named the Democratic Senator and member of the Senate Justice Commission, Dianne Feinstein, a name that prompted the audience to protest loudly.
"Remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
She's intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my local party branch voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
After all, I am the last in a series of labor members of parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, all because we have expressed our opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she was determined to oppose anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, and ironically, these are similar problems that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
An announcement from the Labour Party's meeting in Nottingham East on Friday reads "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local labor member of parliament, Friday night meetings were mostly like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not so and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics is long forgotten, and the question is whether it ever happened.
It has become increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is estimated on the basis of whether it is acceptable to party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I believed to share similar political views began to expect me to make 180-degree turns and take positions that I would never agree with otherwise, whether it was national security or a single European Union market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – it's accompanied by a flood of insults on social networks, calls to remove from the party, convictions of the Centre policy and tell me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just happening to me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who deal with a flood of sexist or racist insults daily, but do not retreat.
Something that disappointed me most in this political age is how these levels of insults became normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different views and every vote of distrust or changes to the rules of selection, the parties are narrowing down.
I got a lot of advice, and for the last two years, they've been trying to get me to bow my head, be less loud, and then I'm gonna be okay.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of Prime Minister Thatcher's government, for which my elementary school classroom literally collapsed, I have sought to advocate better public services to those in need, whether as a local councilor or a cabinet minister.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is heading towards Brexit that will endanger households, jobs and our public services, I don't understand why anyone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not sent to Momentum in Nottingham, but to voters in my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that threats by removing me from the party or political ruse will not prevent me from acting in the way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr on top
Two late attempts may have twisted the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr has won this exciting game of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only undefeated of ten teams.
In the end, the home team won thanks to superior defence, as well as a greater number of opportunities used, and Coach Peter Murchie had reason to be pleased.
"We have been tested in games so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Well done, Ayru, they took their chances better than us."
Grant Naderson's attempt in the 14th minute turned by Frazier Climo gave Ayra the advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who the Warriors let play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage, and Jason Baggott caught an unconverted attempt.
Climo penaltyd up Ayra's lead before, just before halftime, he made a solo shot at the score of 17:5 for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose's second half started well and Patrick Anderson's attempt to turn Baggot has reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on a stretcher, and below, Ayr increased the advantage by attempting Stafford McDowall, who turned Climo.
Deputy Captain Ayra, Blair MacPherson, then he received a yellow card, and Melrose again used the numerical superiority with Bruce Colvin's unconverted attempt after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts also recovered when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card due to fouls over Clim without a ball. MacPherson scored a touchdown down from the penalty line behind the upcoming Ayra pier.
Climo turned, as he did almost from the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's blow to the penal area and sent Gregor Henry's wing to the host's fifth attempt.
The star of Still Game is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still game series, Ford Kieran, is preparing to move into the catering industry after learning that he was appointed director of the company of licensed restaurants.
Fifty-six-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series for which he writes a script and plays along with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series and Kieran seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the Scottish Sun diary suggested Kieran wanted to join the "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, ocean-scaping flags fly.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are plastered with a slogan: "We have a right to the sea.
Returning the exit to the sea is our duty."
Across the mainland of Bolivia is still a powerful memory of the coast that they lost in favour of Chile in a bloodbath around natural resources in the nineteenth century – as well as a longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may be highest in the last few decades, while Bolivia expects the verdict of an international court of justice on October 1st after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has caught momentum, in the spirit of unity and cheerfulness, and of course she expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the International Court of Justice's verdict on large screens across the country, hoping that the UN court in The Hague will rule in favour of Bolivia and claim that after decades of grueling negotiations, Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here comes Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of native origin, who is facing a controversial fight for re-election next year, also has a high stake in Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia, and that little will change even if it decides.
The Dutch-based United Nations body has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict is pronounced only six months after the latest arguments have been heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of making progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have set him back.
"The problem of the exit to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric killed the rest of Chilean goodwill, she noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold these negotiations after this.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement on mutual satisfaction", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – is using the issue of exit to the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to enter the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says disarmament will not occur until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would not abolish nuclear weapons until they trusted Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honour promises made during the Singapore summit between conflicted leaders.
His comments arrived at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared at the border to restart the dead nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and to meet with Kim Jong Una from North Korea.
Ri says it's just a pipe dream that continuing sanctions and opposition to the US declaration ending the Korean war will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree with the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is a general skepticism in terms of the seriousness of Pyongyang as regards the waiver from the nuclear arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare Kim and Trump's second summit.
On Paris fashion shows presented the latest lines of giant hats that you will soon see on a nearby shopping street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you're in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy giant hats on the runways of their shows for spring and summer 2019, outshined everything on Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats won Instagram this summer, and these designers showed their impressive creations on the runways.
The most prominent piece of Valentine's play was an overextended hat with a wide feathered edge that swallowed the head of the model.
Among other bulky accessories were watermelons with ornamental stones, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but their purpose is not to keep your head from cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had flat lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of the creations looked like diving equipment with a snorkel and a mask, and the other one looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you are among those who follow the trend of attracting attention, you are fortunate.
Fashion followers predict that giant hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
Huge hats came after "La Bomba", a straw hat with a two-foot perimeter seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that designed this very impractical hat that flooded the social networks, sent another large creation to the runway – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model that wore it.
The gasyton orange ruffier bag with fringes and a white leather handle was a prominent detail of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous Luke Armitage Stilista said about FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags will arrive at the shops in time for next summer, since the designer made such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for prenamed fashion accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of the language is crucial to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can boast outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding results in exams, which is further strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strives to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and higher education, a chosen career and a place in the society of the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum and curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective subject of students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that understands it pleases his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it pleases his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
Judging by the results of the exams this year, we see that the languages at the top of the league table, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received an A grade at the final high school exam.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students received an A grade from Mandarin at the final exam in high school, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of Spanish, also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electives, are now treated in the same way as STEM objects (natural sciences, technology, machinery and mathematics) and in independent schools programs, and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons the employers cited for the difficulties of filling jobs were the lack of those who knew foreign languages.
Thus, knowledge of foreign languages is becoming increasingly necessary for young people to prepare for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs that require knowledge of foreign languages, this skill is essential in the world of globalization.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they know another language, they will have a true advantage in the future because it is a skill for life.
The art of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically place a person who speaks multiple languages in front of the competition.
According to YouG's survey conducted among more than 4,000 British in 2013, 75 percent did not speak the second language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by two figures, 15%.
This is why investing in foreign language learning is important for children today.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to learning languages.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for Great Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be several languages from which he will be able to choose in independent schools, with professional teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to securing learning environments that will prepare children and give them the skills needed for success, whatever awaits them in the future.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment languages are crucial to the country's future, so it must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is going to debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is about to end for fans who want to see LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James will play Sunday's preseason match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But there's still no telling how many minutes he'll be playing.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at the official Lakers website.
The Laker reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James would probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about plans for six games during the Lakers season.
"At this stage in my career, I don't need preseason matches to prepare," he said.
Trump's convention in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has begun a series of election gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five appointments in the next week including visits to friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While awaiting his vote to fill a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after a vote in November.
When Trump's rally is in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch him online?
Trump's Wheeling rally, West Virginia is scheduled for seven o'clock tonight at Eastern Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's convention in West Virginia below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss hearings this week in connection with Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination in which he was tense over sexual harassment charges, and the expected Senate vote has been postponed for seven days until the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the most important goal of this series of gatherings is to help Republicans achieve a better result in the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said the rallies are being held this week to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters' information.
"Congress control is such a crucial part of his agenda that the president will travel as many states as possible as we enter the season of the election campaign," Reuters campaign spokesman Trump refused to present himself.
Scheduled at the Westbank Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could gather supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time this month, a state in which he won more than 40 per cent of 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, who's not doing well in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to raise his ratings in the polls," Reuters quoted Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, as saying.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team has demonstrated combatance to maintain hope before individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, fours on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing of the pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sports, but one of those that players truly believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Who do they think has the momentum right now?
"They ran six points, and now four, so you can say that the momentum is on our side," Jordan Spieth said on his way out.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, four points higher, with twelve more in the game.
Americans, according to Spieth, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there is much that gives them encouragement, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each took three points out of four.
Spieth was brilliant from the first to the last blow and leads with his example.
The shouts of celebration grew louder and louder during his round, in order to eventually play the key blow for the unsolved score in the fourth match when he and Thomas fell behind two after two.
His final blow to win the 15-hole match was welcomed by a similar shout, one that reflects the faith that the American team has hope.
"You simply have to do your best and take care of your match," Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly Ryder Cup's top story.
An unusual but irresistible European couple won all four matches and played without fail.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't play Godi shots on Saturday afternoon, and they escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game they have shown so far and the way they exchange energy with a noisy audience has strengthened them in the position of their main favorites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take a potential European victory as the sun sets over the courts of Le Golf National.
The best would be both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is too early to discuss European celebrations.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly overpowered Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball game that morning, when he played in pairs with Alex Noren.
One god punch and two doubles in the first nine holes buried a Spaniard and a Swede in a hole from which they couldn't even reach the end.
However, on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The game with four balls and fours is so fascinating to look closely at because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give and which they don't give, and the way a strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage on the final day, but this session of four showed that the United States team also has a desire for a fight that some suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, since after Saturday's matches in the game with four balls and fours, it gained the advantage of 10:6 over the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, were the first to lead with two victories over the moody Tiger Woods, increasing the score so far on Le Golf National's four-point courses.
The Europeans of Thomas Bjorn fought to win back the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the imprecise Americans in the morning's four-ball game and won the 3-to-1 series.
The United States has put up more resistance in the fours tournament, winning two matches, but they couldn't cut back.
Jim Furyk's team must win eight points in 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutante to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, named "Mollywood" after a fantastic weekend, only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four matches.
After they ran over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they got together great and overpowered the exhausted Woods and American debutante Bryson Dechambeau with an even more convincing 5.4.
Woods, who slipped through two matches on Saturday, flashed for moments, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in a four-ball game and fours and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during the morning game with four balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the fours tournament and suffered defeat 2:1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepko – the first and third in the world.
After all, Europe did not go as planned on this pleasant clear day southwest of Paris.
The triple winner of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas' main tournament set a two-point target for Americans on Saturday.
They won 2:1 over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, to come back later and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in fours, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder's history did a team come back after a four-point delay in front of individual matches, although Furyk's defending the title was enough unsolved to keep the trophy.
However, after two days in second place, it seems they could not carry out a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says "no talk" about unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that extending sanctions deepens its distrust of the United States and that in such circumstances the country will by no means unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the UN annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Hu said that in the past year, North Korea has taken "significant measures to show good will", such as nuclear and missile testing interruptions, nuclear field dismantlings and promises not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But there is no proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no question that we will be the first unilateral disarmament."
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to the "approved" approach to denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, the importance of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation from the game as Pyongyang previously did.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current US President and the leader of North Korea on June 12th in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work on "denuklearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also ignored calls to mitigate international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States does not give up ‘denuklearization above all’ and increase the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, opposing even ‘the declaration of the end of the war’," Ri said.
"The thought that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the lonely dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader spoke of in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If we were to negotiate this denuclearisation issue with South Korea, not with the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not come to such an impasse."
However, the tone of Rio's speech differed dramatically from last year, when he said at the UN General Assembly that shooting U.S. land with North Korean missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocketeer" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was still much more to be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea conducted denuclearisation.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't set a time frame for this, saying, "If necessary, let it last two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The Security Council's sanctions must continue strictly and without letting go until the complete, final, confirmed denuclearisation is complete."
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions on North Korea, which have been applied since 2006, in an attempt to prevent funding of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and afterwards said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeii visited North Korea three times this year, but his last journey did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang with words that progress had been made, and after just a few hours, North Korea condemned him for making "gangster demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has promised to dismantle the missile range as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "the appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that "the appropriate measures" requiring the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to force students to sleep more in an effort to eradicate an increasingly popular macho learning culture "all night with caffeine".
An academic noted that students of the world’s leading university are often ignorant of their basic self - care.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course he believes to be the only one of its kind in the United States.
Inspiration to initiate this course was given after a speech he gave about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?’
She said no one has ever told her how important the dream is – which surprised me," He told The Telegraph.
The course held for the first time this year presents the basics of how good sleeping habits contribute to better academic and sporting results, as well as improving their general condition.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the head of university health services, said the university decided to set a course after students were observed to suffer serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of the room in the dorm and students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performances and the importance of bedtime routine.
In the second part, participants were told that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not immediately alter student behavior.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what effects health has on the decision to smoke cigarettes," said Professor Cheisler.
A culture of pride due to the "awakened night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students has led to lack of sleep becoming an increasing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and a quality one, should be a "secret weapon" of students in combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against excess pounds, since the lack of sleep makes the brain go into a starving regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler design a course after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to stand up for his maintenance at the entire campus level.
He hopes the next step is to ask all graduates to pass a similar study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting the alarm on time to sleep and wake up and take care of the harmful effects of "blue light" broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, and thus lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered another depressing defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga shot Steven Gerrard's disarrayed team to one in zero from Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to take their first victory after February's 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard as manager only a second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the elusive leaders of the Ladbrokes Premier League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the uninspired Ranger crew never came anywhere near even.
As the Rangers now hit sixth place, Livingston went up third and behind the Hibernan just because of the goal difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after Judge Calum Spence's line had to be helped when he was thrown at by an object on the side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that beat Ayr to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt opted for the same eleven Livingston players who took the Hearts point last week and would have been thrilled by the way his well-trained team pushed their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball's property, but Livingston used his time with the ball better.
They almost scored just two minutes after Menga's first pass into the empty space sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big shot and took a shot at the goal.
A deep free shot by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only managed to kick past the goal, by the post.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he was to receive a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
The Rangers only scored two touchdowns in the first half, but former Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly, with no major difficulty, defended Lassana Coulibaly's head and tamed the shot that Ovie Eyaria gave.
Although the first goal of Livingston in 34 minutes may not have reflected the real relationship between forces during the game, no one can argue that it was deserved, if not for anything else, then for effort.
The Rangers couldn't handle the deep free kick of Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and that replacement almost immediately scored when the winged player hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came running from his line and blocked him.
However, Livingston continued to persuade the guests to play just as they please, with long balls of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew had the chance to increase the advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor handled himself well and defended Jacobs' attack, so that Lithgow would then head for the goal.
Ranger replacement Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, asked for another penalty when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger counter
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, on this day 136 years ago... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually become a device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the main strongholds of science, the Geiger counter also has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950s bell, starring seemingly amazing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on those headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Yeah, it's crackling!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and then kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of therapy
The procedure includes removing immune cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory
They can thus "see" a protein that is common in many types of cancer, and then re-inject.
The trial vaccine showed promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of the woman who received the vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes removing immune cells from the patient, rewriting them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2, and re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Malignant Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps the growth of several types of cancer" including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "learning" how to target malignant cells was effective in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a fierce speech of support to Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance on SNL.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after an arrogant performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, that evening during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he insulted the Democrats and spoke again about his support for Trump.
"So many times I've talked to white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon and a Hollywood star making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's judicial commission in connection with allegations of sexual harassment of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's speech footage was shared by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make fun of West by putting up the tape.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They teased me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with that hat on.’
They teased me!
And then they tell me that I've collapsed," Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that "he's going to wear Superman's cloak because that means you can't give me orders.
Try love."
His comments caused the audience to whistle at least twice, and members of the SNL team were visibly embarrassed, Variety conveyed, while one person who was present said, "The whole studio is quite quiet."
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West has confused many by performing a song and hunting it disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
Westa was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not retreating to the abusers."
But show host Karen Hunt tweeted that West simply "was who he truly was and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe has embraced and extended ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper posted on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he "will be previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course the late musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to "the artist previously known as Prince".
An attempted murder charge after a person was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast.
Forty-five-year-old boy was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamora, the police said.
The defendants are expected to appear at Belfast Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the D.A.
The star of the Game of Thrones, Kit Harrington condemned the toxic macho culture
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who wields a sword in a violent medieval fantasy, the HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, the actor (31) tackled the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys often feel that they need to be harsh in order to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic macho culture in the time of #MeToo.
A whale who recently married a partner from Leslie Rose's Game of Thrones (31) admitted to having a "strong need" to deal with this problem.
"I personally have a pretty serious problem with the question right now -- what did we do wrong by introducing manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of toxic macho culture because of the depiction of men.
He continued, "What is innate and what is the matter of upbringing?
What is it they teach us on TV and on the streets that makes young men feel they have to fit into a certain pattern of male behavior?
I think that's actually one of the main questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not agree to the sequels or sequels of the Game of Thrones after its end next summer, saying that "he was finished with the battlefields and horses".
Kit will be performing in Sam Shepard True West's play since November, the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
An actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love partner of Kit's character Jon Snow in this fantastic series that won the Emmy Award.
The couple got married in June 2018 on Leslie's parents' property in Scotland.
HIV/Side: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse, which is a change from the previous condition.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of viral blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way was almost zeroed in, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say the discrimination of LGBT individuals is widespread.
Studies estimate that because of conservative perceptions in the country, 70–90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Transferring the virus is often due to inappropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff leaked information about Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US MP Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff released the personal data of three US Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of those lawmakers.
The Democratic Legislator from Los Angeles claims that these allegations are placed by experts and websites of the "ultradeznik's wing".
"Lie, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter release.
The published information allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information came online on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate commission hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The release of information came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the announcement is connected to the Waters office and released information about a member of her staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and false claims – is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
A statement by Waters soon sparked a condemnation on the Internet, issued by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial exudes rage," Fleischer wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the temperament required for a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they mustn't be angry.
He mustn't be impertinent.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, accused by critics of acting too furious at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a republican candidate running to relieve Waters in the mid-term elections, also spoke via Twitter.
"Big deal if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office warned "the appropriate authorities and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We will see to it that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and to answer before the law for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Film review Johnny English again in action – lukewarm spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already turned into tradition to look for a subtext about Brexit in every new film with British theme, which can also be applied to this continuation of the franchise of satirical action comedy about Johnny English – which began in 2003 with the realization of "Johnny English" and returned to the screens in 2011 with the extension "Johnny English: reborn".
Will the ironic auto-sat about how obviously we're useless be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Anyway, butt-faced, incompetent Johnny English rubber face got a new chance to screw something up – his name more than anything else reveals that it was a general comedy creation designed for cinema audiences whose English is not the native language.
It is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite the bizarre pretensions to the highest glamour, carries a little Clouseau, a little bit of Mister Bean and a little bit of that guy who played just one note within the theme tune of the "Chariots of Fire" opening ceremony in London in 2012.
It is also originally based on a traveler and an international man wrapped in a veil of secrecy that Atkinson once played in now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest is an undertaking are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval chivalry armor and the rotors' knives rattle briefly on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very strange way redundant, especially now that "serious" film brands such as 007 and Impossible Mission confidently add comic elements.
The impression is that it's about humor for children, not for adults, and for me, the wild adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's silent movie gags in Mr. Bean's image.
Now the topic is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
The hacker infiltrated Britain's top secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, the horror of an agent on duty -- unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop in a full glass of water for the prime minister, the pompous and depressed figure who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to the fall of political popularity: Emma Thomson has mastered this character based on Theresa May, but the script is quite scarce.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fancy institution, but unofficially lectures on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gags when English holds the Academy of Spying in the manner of "School Rock".
The English are quickly sent back to Whitehall for urgent instructions and to reassemble it with former patient partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander in whose energetic and noisy role Vicki Pepperdine is a bit spent.
So Batman and Robin for screwing things up are back at Her Majesty's Secret Service and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletov, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
The English and Bough begin their odyssey of comic events: disguised as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, making a mess of themselves by secretly boarding Volta's luxury yacht and the English launches a real anarchy trying to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house using headphones for virtual reality.
It's obvious that a great deal of effort has been put into that last sequence, but as sweet and cheerful as it is, it's like it's made for children.
It's a pretty mediocre quality.
Like other Johnny English movies, I can't help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with a role for Rowan Atkinson to really show off his talent?
The Labour Party denies making a plan for the British to work four days a week and get paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan by which the British would work four days a week, but they were paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company heads to transfer the time they save to workers thanks to the AI revolution by assigning them another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea "would fit" into the party's economic programme and plans to improve labour conditions and workers' rights.
The transition to a four-day work week was approved by the Syndicate Congress as a way that workers could exploit the changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "A new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party's approach to the rebalance of the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's industrial strategy in general."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this ambition does not have the support of the entire Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said "The four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it".
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his view of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the hands of the "faceless executives" and "profiters" in utility companies.
The opposition Chancellor's plans also mean that the current owners of shares in water supply companies may not recover their entire investments because Labour could impose "deductions" on the basis of perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company committees and to create inclusive equity funds that would allocate 10% of the value of companies in the private sector to employees who are likely to collect annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy speaking for 60 Minutes on whether the FBI investigation might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week and begs the question whether the Bureau's investigation could get some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I think so, of course," Kennedy said.
"Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was unwavering, determined, unequivocal."
However, Senator Graham's voice appears to have been cemented.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh has been formed and a strong accusation would be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has vigorously denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she appoints cannot confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Festival of Citizens of the World and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Citizens of the World, an annual musical event with a truly impressive list of stars to perform, and an equally impressive goal – to put an end to poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Festival of Citizens of the World will gather tens of thousands of people on the great lawn of Central Park who will not only enjoy performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of this event, which is to put an end to extreme poverty by 2030.
The festival of citizens of the world, held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the global anti-poverty project, an international group that advocates the abolition of poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for the VIP ticket), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "works", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, a phone call and any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the Citizen of the World project with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to do something, or just another kind of so-called "clictivism" – when people believe they've done something to change the world by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Citizens of the World initiative has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters who advocated a number of different goals.
They say these actions led world leaders to publish promises and political directions worth more than $37 billion and will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements stemming from their actions, and at least 10 billion dollars were already allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the collected funds have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the power of nutrition, the partnership of investors and realists from Great Britain who pledged to "help children grow into their full potential", pledging that Rwanda would allocate $35m to the end of malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as yourself, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition become a historical footnote," said Food Powers Ambassador Tracey Ullman, visiting live concerts in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on Great Britain to improve mother and children's nutrition, the government announced it would finance the dietary power project, whose interventions would touch the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website that says, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world answers: "It will be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we will fall and fall.
However, like all great civil rights movements and anti apartheids before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy exports – Secretary of the Interior
Washington can "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, according to Ryan Zinke, the US Interior Secretary, and Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russian engagement in Syria – namely, there are legitimate government calls – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of southern Europe," he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States has this opportunity to ensure that, together with our navy, the sea corridors remain open or block them as necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event organised by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, stating that it was the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less about using and replacing fuel," he said, saying Russia has only one trump, and that its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements come after the Trump administration's mission to increase exports of natural gas in Europe, replacing Russia with a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin a "invention" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars and needs to double the existing gas pipeline capacity at 110 billion cubic metres, is exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the reasons for Washington's fierce opposition to this project are purely economic and this is an example of disloyal competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should have the possibility of choosing suppliers," Russian Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The US's position has sparked a reaction from Germany that has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the German Industry Alliance (BDI), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Alliance (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" about the presidential candidacy for 2020, State Senator Massachusetts said.
On Saturday, Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "think seriously" about running for president after the next mid-term elections.
During a meeting at Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would reconsider her candidacy.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman at the top," the source of The Hill quoted her as saying.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren called President Donald Trump during a meeting at city hall, saying he "leads this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was called out for criticism of Trump and his candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet she published on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, Thursday's poll results showed that most of the electorate who voted for Warren did not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of voters who will "probably" vote in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of voters supporting potential candidacy and 48 per cent against candidacy.
Other names from the Democratic Order discussed in terms of their potential candidacy in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin was talking about PTSD on Track Palin at Donald Trump's support rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence following an incident Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he goes through after he returns, I can connect with what happens to other families who suffer the consequences of PTSD and the vulnerability that our soldiers return to," she told the audience at a support rally for President Donald Trump in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a burning theme" and, speaking of his son and other war veterans, added "they return a little different, return a little harder, come back wondering if there is respect for what their comrades soldiers and pilots have given, and all other military members have given for this country."
He was arrested Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence -- assaulting a woman, obstructing domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of opiates, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries, D.C. supports contesting new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Columbia District support a review of a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District submitted a friendly report to the court in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Freedom Union in August against the federal police has not been discovered.
She said she was abused by her partner "and violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was held in custody in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace explained that the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States are facing a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has annulled the decision of the 2014 Immigrant Complaints Committee that allowed immigrants who do not own documents and flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District State Prosecutor Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is neglecting decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires that all asylum requirements be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the request, and thus the chamber violates that principle," the friendly report said.
Lawyers further in the report claim that the police that prevent immigrants from entering are harming the US economy, and that they will likely become entrepreneurs and "safe the necessary workforce."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant cases not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is only available to those who leave their home countries for persecution or fear of belonging to a certain race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or for their political opinion," the session said in a statement of June 11th, referring to politics.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all problems, even all the serious problems that people face around the world daily.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palu as the death toll doubles in search of survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"It is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusum, comforting her sick little boy at the evacuation center in the devastated town of Pal.
"Emergency brings bodies every minute.
There's a shortage of clean water."
Residents return to their broken homes, rummaging through flooded things trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees were overcrowded.
Some of the injured like Dwi Haris, whose back and shoulder were broken, are located outside Palua Military Hospital, where patients are being helped outside due to sustained severe side quakes.
His eyes are filled with tears as he talks about how he felt a powerful earthquake that rocked the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed by the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press agency, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "violence with propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted an ad on four pages in the U.S. Daily newspaper praising the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump addressed China Daily's paid addition to the China Daily newspaper in Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6th election, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marks, as US officials told Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish ads aimed at promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war where they increase tariffs on imports.
As a countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were aimed at exporters in countries such as Iowa supporting Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former longtime mayor of Iowa, who is the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in Sunday's newspaper Des Moines Register, "now doubling this violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the government of China is exploiting the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, posting a paid ad in the Des Moines Register newspaper," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at a newsstand located down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have on China's troubled economic path, bearing in mind that Chinese media is under the firm baton of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention what newspaper it was.
Republicans deter women from voting ahead of mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
Analysts warned that many of the most prominent Republicans who defend and stand by the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several allegations of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions associated with this issue are very intense and most Republicans are already showing that they want to vote.
There is no going back in these matters," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, said in an article for a magazine published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) at the last minute requested an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn, says in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators shouted "November is coming!" during demonstrations in the Senate Hall, while Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to persevere with the Kavanaugh candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be enormous," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told news.
"People say he's already tall, which is true.
But he could be taller, especially among the indecisive female voters in the suburbs and younger voters between 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony brought details of the alleged sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts felt that negative reactions could occur if Republicans persisted with the appointment.
"This has become a big mess for the Big Old Party," NBC News quoted Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, as saying earlier this week.
"It is not just about voting the Committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also about the way Republicans solved this issue and how they treated it," he noted for the information channel Guy Cecil, director of the group Priorities USA, which supports the election of Democrats.
Yet, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided about who to trust after witnessing Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slight tilt on the side of Kavanaugh.
The new YouGov poll shows that 41% of the respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38% said he thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30% said they felt the same way about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who made the accusation, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez allegedly claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals while attending a party during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web network inventor plans to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web network, is launching a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Open Source Solid platform, which is the creator of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and what people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the Inrupt's intention was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store online" or POD (personal online data store).
It may contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique to a personal data store online is that it depends entirely on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that the company Inrupt provide sources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM security platform, a number of employed development engineers engaged to work on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their models of business overnight will be completely destroyed.
"We don't ask their permission."
In an announcement from Saturday on the Medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to secure commercial energy and ecosystems that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although launched by Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Foundation for the Web and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria’s Cross to the Priest in World War I
The celebration in honour of the only priest of the Church of England , who was awarded the Cross of Victoria as a fighter in the First World War , was organized in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, for an attack in the cities of Bellgleise and Lehaucourt.
A few days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had won Britain's greatest military recognition.
At a parade held in Rushden on Saturday, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered a plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "unbelievablely symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after the feat his grandfather received the prize for.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel "through a very dense fog and under heavy fire from the battlefield and machine gun fire."
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest heroism" led the platoon forward before he ran without any help to the Polish cannon and mowed down three from the military squad.
Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4th 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never reach, but also something that causes obedience."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows support for many."
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead got Pepa Pigs
Imagine that, you stayed up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206, to prevent you from watching the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and was aired live during the night on Channel 5 in Britain.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were amazed when Pepa Pigs were interrupted.
Many were not impressed that they stayed up all night until the early hours of the morning precisely because of the struggle.
A Twitter fan described this break in cartoon transmission as "some kind of sick joke."
"It is a government regulation that says that at 6 a.m. this content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of the Bellator for Marketing and Communications, at the transfer issue.
"Pepa Pig," yes.
Bellator Scott Coker said he would work on his schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I talk about rewriting, I think we can probably solve it," Coker said.
"But the transmission is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to realize anything until Sunday comes with us, when they'll have it on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a break-up, there were correspondence and they were all hostile.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't like that, it was a matter of government jurisdiction.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We'll reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've gone too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
Twenty-four-year-old said he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs representing Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke openly about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that the fact that he became a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has been away for several months due to illness.
Showing up as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said that growing up he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, these feelings of inferior value and the feeling that I am different were the right things that gave me power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that "someone," he said, so that people would not be disappointed when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a very important fighter for the LGBT population and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he considered himself lucky to have the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others "hope."
The triple world champion said falling in love with a man, US producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 "surprised."
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, and said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you've been through so much while you're so young" -- he first appeared at the Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later -- said it was hard to find someone the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple came true as the parents of the boy Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "total perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was only about "I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son's name was the same as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be there to sit in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I simply knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life -- that I was swimming in front of a domestic audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which echoed in it as he prepared for the Olympics and still shivering.
Desert Island Discs is on the 4 BBC Radio on Sunday at 11:15 British Summer Time.
Mickelson out of shape on a bench at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to regain his form so this won't be a bumpy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays at the national record for the 12th time, captain Jim Furyk has been benched in Saturday's games with four balls and four games.
Instead of being in the center of action, as it often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and improving the range of the game, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the height of his career, is not an ideal choice for Le Golf National's demanding terrain, where long bumpy terrain regularly punishes stray blows.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, in the ninth game Sunday, who won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who start the 12 individual games four points down, get to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he trusted his man, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great faith in himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined there'd be more, but that's how it went, and we thought it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches.
This could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halftimes, even though Furyk said his presence brought some immaterial value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have a guy like that on the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup matches can easily be turned into an unpleasant experience.
Dane first appeared at a game in the city of Walderrama in 1997, when the party whose captain was Seva Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended the competition with a narrow margin of 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You constantly remind yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brooklin where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won," Bjorn said, conceived after watching the 2018 team that won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going all the way tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try and win this trophy and that remains the focus.
All I'm saying is, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's across the street on the other side -- the greatest players in the world."
Thrilled by the performance of his players in the difficult golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this carry me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
Tomorrow it's individual games, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with your partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you test your ultimate ability as a golfer.
That's the message you have to give to the players - give it your best shot tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best too."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they played in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Suryk himself was at both ends of these great turns on the last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up a loser after Europe performed "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, a 1999 captain, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning, such as what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When you take a run like that, it puts a lot of pressure on middlegames.
We've formed our lineup accordingly and we've got the boys ready so we can try and do some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas was assigned to try and counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in this lineup because I think it can cover all the way," Bjorn said about choosing players for singles.
New German warship on hold again
The German Navy's new frigate was to be launched in 2014 to replace the Cold War's old warships, but it will not arrive in at least another year due to systems failure and emergency costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship in the class of brand new Baden-Wuertemberg frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoted by the military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but the problems after delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuertemberg Navy ships ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as it's known, they'll have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for the latest frigates to be deployed up to two years without returning to their home ports.
Still, constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which were to allow Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, would already be obsolete by the time they began to use them, states Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate arrived in the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware gaps" that would make the ship unusable if it were deployed on a combat mission.
Software defects were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuertemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors -- exactly half of the number of people who ran the old Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is significantly too heavy, reducing its impact and limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tons is the weight of a ship called Rheinland-Pfalz twice as much as a class-like ship used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of a complete project, including staff training, is also becoming problematic.
It is said to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
Problems related to the latest frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, acknowledged that the Navy is in fact "missing ships that can be deployed."
The official said the problem grew over time, as old ships were burned and no replacement ships were procured.
He complained that none of the frigates in Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted at an estate in the Highlands of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study led by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will be accompanied by ordinary bats and a kind of soprano Pipistrella, and a brown long-eared bat and bat-type Daubenton in the Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recording device will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
Employees and NHS volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
A professional analysis of the recordings of all records will determine the frequency of the bat calls and what they do.
A map of habitats and reports will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant at NTS, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are the most important bats and how each species uses them.
This data will help determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and which is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the UK has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works, which negatively affect litters and habitat loss.
Windmills and lighting may also pose a risk, including sticky paper and chemical processing of construction materials, and domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly perform checks, inspections of the litter, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threava estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight out of ten bats in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson says the estate is ideal territory for them.
"Here in Three we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all good habitats.
But there's still so much unknown about bats, that what we do here and on other properties will help us understand better what they need to move forward."
He emphasizes how important it is to check whether bats are on the property, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother's litter could kill up to 400 females and young women, which is likely to wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and the law prohibits them from killing, harassing, harassing, or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Scots' Bat Preservation Fund, encouraged the public to engage and assist.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how the population of most of our species is developing."
Ronaldo's dropping rape charges while lawyers are filing a lawsuit against a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges addressed to him as "false news," saying people "want to be promoted" using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who has filed charges.
Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, after that, he paid her $375,000 to keep this incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing his followers who had 142 million in the Instagram Live video, hours after the indictment report, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the reports by calling them "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the camera's five-time Golden Ball winner.
"They want to be promoted using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain fame by talking about me, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," added the player smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called "unauthorized reporting of privacy doubts," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "inmaterial damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in an apartment of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to documents delivered to Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% good guy" who was let down by the "1%."
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they photographed her injuries at the hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of retribution" and was worried that "she would be publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old says she's now seeking an annulment because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juva for 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will regret losing car manufacturers forever
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its status as world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that "concerning" is what Toyota UK said about the BBC -- if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily halt production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of delays at the borders in the event Bexit is left without an agreement could cause job losses.
The Burnaston factory, produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain gets out of the EU in late March we will see the production halt in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK producers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover expressed fear about how cross-border trade will work if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call risks in the supply chain in the Brexit case without agreement.
The Toyota production line works on the principle of "just in time", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there may be a break at the border, which can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store supplies for more than a day at his factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the "Chequers" plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We must have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow as I say, not only to enjoy our present success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in today's Radio 4 programme at the BBC.
"The example of not only Toyota but also of other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been an extremely successful series of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, but warned that in the long run additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and eventually reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is president of the Union Union in the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when jobs like this close, they never return.
The government spokesman said: "We must present the precise and convincing plan of our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's very important meeting with Deputy District Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" because the battle continues with Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in the elections, ties between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential obstructions of justice by the president.
Whether Trump is going to fire the Deputy Attorney General or not, and thus endangering Mr. Mueller's independence, it's been a topic of gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had also discussed a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of a 25th amendment removal.
Rosenstein has dismissed these rumors.
But last Monday, he was in the White House, in the middle of a rumor that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the Senate Judiciary Commission hearing on which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation Friday on charges against Kavanaugh over a week, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Channel on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date for this has not yet been established, it could be this week, and it could be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are going on about the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like the press to always be informed."
Some journalists would refute this claim: Sanders did not hold a brief press release at the White House since September 10th.
Head Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that a small number of short addresses are not due to the repulsion of "theatral behavior" by TV journalists, although she said, "I will agree with the fact that they exaggerate."
She then said direct contact between Trump and journalists would be strengthened.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without stating evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
Short talks will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to direct the question to the president of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this as much as possible and you've seen us do it over the past few weeks, and these talks with the president of the United States will replace short addresses with journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when officials visit.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of gathered journalists unbridled and occasionally strange.
Health Secretary writes to EU employees at the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland about Brexit fears
The health secretary wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to settle the costs of resolved EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued during the summer, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this has been a very restless time for all of you.
As a result, I wanted to repeat how much I appreciated the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their citizenship.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which benefits patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergo emergency surgery after head injury
Team Defense Team State Tigers Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, was undergoing emergency surgery after he injured his head in Saturday's defeat 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores Club, reported Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the field line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before they put him on the stretcher and took him for further questioning.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville channel, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed his operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/area of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore in a red jersey, plays first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher property purchase fees in the UK
Buyers from foreign countries will be charged higher taxes when buying real estate in the UK, using additional funds to help homeless people according to new conservative plans
This move will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
Higher taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The vault expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes when buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This move will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn in an effort to attract young voters by promising to provide more affordable housing care and focus on those who earn more.
Higher fees will be charged to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, while additional money will strengthen the government's intention to fight outdoor sleep.
The additional fee, which was introduced in addition to the existing tax, including higher levels, two years ago to another property and to purchase for rent, could be as much as 3%.
The vault expects this move to increase revenue to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are bought by people who have no residence in the UK, which is why prices are rising, and customers who buy real estate for the first time are harder to become homeowners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of state.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction to help more young people reach their first home.
He accused construction firms of holding high real estate prices by buying the land they do not use, and asked Mrs May to drop the quotas for affordable houses as soon as possible to break the British "residential policy shame."
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and suspension of unprovoked evictions.
He also wants to give the council greater authority to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my term as prime minister to bringing back the British dream - that every new generation's life should be better.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work, and build a life in it.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes as easily as valuable British.
The dream of ownership of the house has become far too remote for many people, and the inhuman sleep in the open is still very real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to be the manager of the Scottish team at a certain point.
Forty-two-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of a Northeast club, currently ranked third in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I was on B-team and that was it," Ross told Sportsund BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be given if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sanderland managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic club says he didn't feel restless because he comes after such big names to such a big club, after refusing to offer clubs Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of my success at the moment will be in this 'will I be able to get this club back to the Premier League?'
Judging by the structure and possibilities of this club, it undoubtedly falls into the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think I can only consider myself successful if I can get the club back where it belongs."
Ross was only in the third year of his management career, after a period he spent as assistant chief in Dambarton and 15 months spent as part of Harts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Allo recover from falling into the third category, and St. Miren dragged her off the edge of a minor league to the champions' winner next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled the takeover of the Allo club.
"I honestly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I wasn't bad, I was making a decent living, and I enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just suits me.
I've always wanted to do management, and now I'm doing it, in all my adult life I haven't felt more comfortable than I do now."
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30, on the Radio of Scotland from 12:00 to 13.00 British Summer Time.
Perfect time for a cup is Saturday at 5:30, revealing research.
The summer heat wave increased the traffic of British pubs struggling to survive, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
A 2.7% increase in sales in pubs and bars was achieved in July, but restaurant traffic dropped by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting company, who collected data, said: “Permanently sunny time and longer than expected for England to participate in the World Championships has contributed to following a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs grew to 2.8.8%, and restaurants had an even greater decline.
Traffic fell in restaurants of 1.8% in June and only worsened in July.
The drinking-focused pubs and bars achieved a far better result with higher growth compared to comparable results from the previous period than the decline in restaurant traffic.
The food-focused pubs also died because of the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The pubs and bars increased the sale of drinks by 6.6% per month, with food sales dropping by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM Entertainment Analysis Agency, said: "These results continue the trend we have been witnessing since late April.
Weather conditions and influence of major social and sporting events remain the main factors when it comes to sales on the outside of households.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight hard, although the drop in sales of 4.8% yearly will be particularly painful with already present price pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for food-focused caterers, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide a little bit more needed relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slower introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industrial sales tracking service in the retail sector of bars, pubs and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes data on the impact of 47 business groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds and represents an accepted industrial measure.
Every fifth child has a secret warrant on social media that he hides from his parents
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret warrant on social networks that hides from their parents and teachers, reveals research.
A survey covering more than 20,000 elementary school students revealed an increase in the number of “fake Instas” pages
This news has increased the fear of disclosure of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" order showing parents
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, makes warrants on social networks that he hides from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 elementary school students revealed a sudden rise in “fake Insta” orders, which refers to the Instagram photo sharing site.
This news has increased the fear of disclosure of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main" order showing their parents, but they also have private orders.
One mother who came across a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage girl who called others "rape me."
A survey conducted by the organisation Digital Consciousness of the UK and Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40% of children from 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private orders.

Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic committee as executive director at the annual assembly of that governing body.
Doyle is the most prized Scottish athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who run sports to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of an athlete and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including winning races at 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 games in Atlanta, and is now a regular BBC expert, remained immobile after experiencing a transitive ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could tell if I'd recover and how much.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing exercises for agility!
Thanks for the encouraging messages!"
Advertise for Mothers Compared to Cows Shared Opinions on the Internet
The company that produces traitors shared opinions on the Internet with a commercial that breast-feeds with milk cows.
To mark the launch of a product described as "the first silent betrayer", the consumer technology company Elvie published an advertisement inspired by an entertainment music video showing the freedom that the new pump provides for mothers who issue milk.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn among hay and cows with a song that reads, "Yes, I milk but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not a udder, it's my breasts."
Here's the chorus: "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, milk myself."
However, an advertisement published on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has caused different reactions from viewers, while many have said it sheds light on the "terrible" dairy industry.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to get pregnant and have babies like us to produce milk, but they have their babies kidnapped a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie Pump is discreetly fit into a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: "It is clearly traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why wouldn't they be used to advertise traitors for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "Advertising without meaning."
Others stood up for the commercial, and one woman admitted that her song was hilarious.
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I was still breast-feeding.
Betrayal made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little silly, but I figured it out right.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "This is a ridiculous commercial aimed at mothers who issue milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like "cows".
This isn't an ad that praises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all danced with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many milk mothers say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, no wires, no pipes, and fits into a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they issue milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother's company, commented: "The Pump Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a daring and provocative launch.
By drawing the parallel between the breast-feeding mother and the milk cow, we wanted to focus the milk issue and all the challenges that go along with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made the headlines.
During Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the runway in the creation of Martha Jakubowska using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly relocated to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrants has increased, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult to find guardians for children.
Traditionally, most guardians themselves were migrants without documents afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to accept the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, said in front of Congress last week that the service had arrested dozens of people who applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not been convicted before.
"Near 80% of persons who are either guardians or household members are illegally in this country, and most of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to search for these persons, said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to get the children through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules under which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, the workers at the shelter say.
Many will make a video call instead of a personal call to ask the immigration judge for legalization of their status.
Those who are determined not to meet the conditions will be deported quickly.
The longer children remain locked up, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to outbursts of rage or attempts to escape, the workers of the shelter point out and reports coming from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such risks have been raised in larger institutions such as the one in Tornillo, where the size makes it much easier to overlook signs indicating that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria seeks immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupation forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return, although the war has been in the country for the past eight years.
Moualem, who is also acting as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian country, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with appropriately."
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the session.
Moualem insisted that the "War on Terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "a holy fight until we exterminate all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly in charge of training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-destroyed country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said there are good conditions for their return and blamed "the Western countries" for "providing irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a pure humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no assistance to rebuild Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has deterred a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia in a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that military action would be launched against jihadists and fighters from the front of Nusra associated with Al-Qaeda, which "will be exterminated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of authorities and members of the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem laid out the terms of the Syrian government for participation in the work of the committee, saying the work of the body should be limited to "considering members of the current constitution" and warned about the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections, unless, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for, the recall and scandal earlier terminate his mandate.
This would undoubtedly represent "The most dramatic end of the presidential term of all time!"
So far, no sign of viewers fatigue.
Since 2014, the rating in prime time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC channel.
According to the Nielsen agency, Fox News Channel has an average of 2.4 million hits in prime time, unlike four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and Rachel Maddow's MSNBC Channel Show exceeded the cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers during the evening with breaking news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something that we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the play "Survivor Chosen" on the ABC channel, about the secretary of government who becomes president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of the book "Only Funny Parts: and a few harsh truths about getting into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she'd vote for Trump.
Why, she asked.
"He said, "because she makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos also has fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming in from Washington can decide the future of the abortion law from Roe v. Wade's proceedings, whether immigrant families can merge and what the state of global economy will be.
Excluding is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realized that you watched a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used sources of "deep background" for his book "Fear," about Paul Manafort's jacket of ostrich skin worth $15,000", "the suit with a thick set of arrogance," Washington Post wrote, and the implications of graphic descriptions, this, anatomy, Mr. Trump given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he does to you is to see him as a reality show that feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "The Pawnshop", commenting on rotating the acting set and daily plot of Trump's show (the criticism of the American Football League, the praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you're behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai was sunny with a temperature of about 80 degrees (27°C), but he closed himself in and watched MSNBC and also recorded CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember in the past when we did all these crazy shows, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Big cash flow on the side in the most uncertain mid-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redeployment of congressional districts, resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
A recent cut of the province's suburbs in Pittsburgh led to the election of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who came to the helm of the second district after the early elections last spring.
Lamb is fighting another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards were repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutional for Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a campaign to finance campaigns between key party fund collectors, the Committee that raises funds for the democratic campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congressional Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the wide-ranging special elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District in March.
That position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political analysts gave little advantage to Democrats.
The United States considers punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then withdraws
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little incentive from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump had a hearty meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varel and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from EL Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, said in a statement early this month.
But the penalties were considered only for El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140m in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial aid and the target visa restrictions, would hardly affect this Central American country at a high unemployment and murder rate.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which was to be a continuation of a similar meeting last year that represented a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and thus, in effect, they stopped any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three US envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any more heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions provided they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The following could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump's judiciary, which now has significant evidence in public records.
According to reports, Mr Mueller also directed his investigation to reveal a possible link between Trump's campaign and Russia's election attack.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he's preparing to step forward to the polls again, and possibly to the jury.
There are a lot of these "ifs" and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall, or those in Europe that are similar to him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, only that the West stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such breaking points, and the relentless march of democracy speeds up or slows down.
The Americans are now facing several of these breaking points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an unenviable position since this paper reported last year that he proposed a secret recording of the president and made speculation that he is not fit to perform his function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times deposition is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite convincing allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And on top of that, are we going to vote in the middle-term elections for Congress to be held accountable by Mr. Trump?
If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I was ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light candles for Sabbath on that swastika table.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers optimistic ahead of confronting Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapida from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Austrians, after an impressive stretch in Spain against Villarrel early this month, would put them in a good position to qualify from the G European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrance's embroidery player from debuting this season until an unsolved match with Vilareal's final score of 2-2, but he is convinced that the Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone for further action.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," said a 31-year-old player.
"We entered the game believing we could achieve something, and we went with the point.
Maybe we could have taken them all the way, but all in all, the unsolved result is probably just.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got back in the second and we were better.
On Thursday, we'll be expecting a big European night again.
We're hoping we can take three points, but it's gonna be a tough match because they had a good score in the last game, though, with the audience's support, we can certainly push it out and get a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly difficult, starting with everything that happened to my injuries to the changes in the club itself, but now we're satisfied with what we have.
The team's in good shape, and the guys are really enjoying it; we're training well.
I hope now we can continue, put the last season behind us and be successful."
Women can't sleep worrying about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their families.
About half of the people surveyed by Nationwide said they discussed long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10% said they talked about it with their children.
"People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they don't want to start a conversation on the subject," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Cooperate with your adviser and your family and consider where and how to be provided for you, as such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Turn on your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that would help you cover those costs or self-insurance with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Arrange your legal documents: In root prevent legal battles.
Make an authorization to make decisions on medical assistance so that you have an authorized person of trust to monitor the medical care provided to you and ensure that healthcare professionals act according to your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider the conclusion of a financial power of attorney agreement.
This implies that you choose a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your bills if you remain powerless.
Do not forget the minor details: imagine that your elderly parent finds himself in a situation where he needs urgent medical attention and is being taken to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
State the details in the written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are," Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As the connection ended, relief officials were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala province, areas north of Palu, closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palu.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when he was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The area, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299.200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture form the basis of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit the West Donggala in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006.: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, launching a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009.: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the town of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010.: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016.: A shallow earthquake struck the region of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing demolition and panic because it reminded people of the deadly destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of buildings.
2018.: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people lost their lives, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily captured.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice president candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaskan State Police Agency.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he confiscated her phone.
Palin was detained in Mat-Su detention unit and set a bail bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared at the court on Saturday, where he pleaded "no doubt guilty", the network said.
Palin is facing three Class A violations, which means he's facing a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offense, punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been prosecuted.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Alaskan Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised state associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after having linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake that caused the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been a break in ties and electricity supply, and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was right next to the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipovo, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City where eight people were killed -- a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck at Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle trail along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, taking down pedestrians and cyclists who got in his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipo's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted a serious bodily injury, according to a request for sentencing, filed in the southern district of New York.
On both counts, the death penalty is possible, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipo with 22 counts of murder and racketeering charges, which federal prosecutors usually use in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's way of carrying him out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca," said the application for sentencing.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York last had a case in which the death penalty was threatened.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 over Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were visibly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of acquittal to guilt will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipa's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to "mobilise the people's army" during a protest at a conservative conference.
Former leader of the Party for Independence, the UK said politicians had to "feel dissatisfaction" with Eurosceptics, as one of Therese May's deputies suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have "come out" by now if Mr. Farage had been the secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Ms. May in an effort to unite her deeply divided ranks was stressed by conservatives who advocated staying in the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks and supporters and opponents Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it continue with attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the "haos".
Mr. Bone said to go to the meeting to go to Solihull that he wanted to "discard Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
The Messenger from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinates.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and that they want to remain is completely incorrect."
Brexita supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the rally, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
"Please reject the Chequers plan and begin to listen."
In a harsh message to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the crowd that politicians must be forced to "feel dissatisfaction" if they are about to fail the decision made in the referendum in 2016.
"Now it is about trust between us - the people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "it won't work".
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel dissatisfaction.
"We are mobilizing the nation's army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the resistance marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally downtown.
Several activists waved banners "Torians versus Brexit" after forming a group this weekend.
Laburist Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are people telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the "Canada Plus Plus" plan, for undisturbed border conditions, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
Good Brexit is not possible," he added.
Warren is planning on seriously considering running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts domocrate spoke of her future during a participatory meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, has again run for election in November against the Republican representative at Geoff Diehl's House of Representatives, who was co-chairing Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She's at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electricians where a participatory meeting format has been used since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government, and that includes a woman in charge."
Arrest after LSU Sims was shot.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday's arrest of a suspect in a shooting that killed a basketball player named LSU Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Station announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at 11:00 at a press conference.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was released, asking for help in finding the man on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday.
Wayde Sims was shot in the head after which he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the crime scene, in possession of a weapon, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and brought into the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Junior 6-foot-6 who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played 32 games with 10 starters and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 hits and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after his order ensures victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Walteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two laps and urging Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went into boxing first and left Hamilton behind to engage in rear traffic, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action of the wheel which reluctantly forced the Ferrari driver to leave free interior at the risk of falling behind after a double stroke in defense of the third bend.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran most of the race by relying on his tires to get to the quick finish line and outpace Kimmy Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally made it to the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Walteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a truly remarkable job to achieve a one-two formation finish," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinsten at a rally Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release a letter to the public to Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deal with the Ford testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil, vicious, and lying.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and mean and lying, he said.
When you look at the announcements and the information that leaked to the public, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the information?
You remember her answer... did you release the document to the public... whatever?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it out."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn't," he added, imitating a senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July detail on Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September -- yet Feinsten denied that information had leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't release her story to the public." Feinstein told the board, Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, as she requested."
But her denial did not come upon the approval of the president, who commented on Saturday night at the rally: Let me tell you, that was a really bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body language."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president insinuated that Democrats use these allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power at all costs.
You see meanness, spite, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for defeating Belfast Giants in the Elte League on Friday by winning 5 to 3 in a match in Dundee on Saturday.
At the very beginning, the Giants scored two goals for Patrick Dwayer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the domestic tie before Dwyer regained the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard evened out for Dundee before two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elte League season for Adam Keef's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season of the two sides, and the Giants won the last three matches.
Dwayer opened the match in the fourth minute, 3:35, with the assistance of Kendall McFaulla, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvilliera and doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the crowd at the beginning, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie for a tie at 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the lead of the Giants in the second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again brought them to a tie in measuring the force naked at 2737 minutes.
Cownie and Charles joined together to help Nielsen bring Dundee into the lead for the first time at the end of the second period, and he scored the fifth goal in the mid-final period to ensure his team won.
The Giants, who lost four matches so far, are welcoming Milton Keynese in the next match Friday.
The air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane avoid an earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero after he was killed ensuring a safe flight with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people were killed, and many were reported missing after a massive earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, launching a tsunami.
Strong subsequent earthquakes continue to affect this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Palu Airport, which was rockin' hard.
He stayed to ensure the safe takeoff of Batika Air Flight 6321, who was standing on the runway at the time.
When he realized the control tower was collapsing, he jumped off.
He passed away later at the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantana to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
It breaks our hearts for this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of casualties could reach thousands, while the state disaster relief agency says the approach to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is believed that the number of victims is still growing since numerous bodies are still under the ruins, and many cannot be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reached altitude and up to six metres devastated Pala, where a mass burial will take place Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Ambulance vehicles bring bodies every minute.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jean Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Red Cross of Indonesia is busy working to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Widowo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the army of the state: I ask all of you to work all day to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lobok that killed more than 550 people.
The plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini announces that after the plane crash in the lagoon, one face is missing.
The airline, whose aircraft crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, announces that one face is missing, after earlier announcing that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they have been unable to trace the passenger.
The airline says it is working in co-operation with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to inquiries for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials announced Friday that seven persons were transferred to the hospital.
The airline announced that six more passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the fall and what the exact sequence of events was.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy announced that the plane ended up in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses think the plane flew across the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to make it to the emergency exit through the water that reached their waist on the plane that was sinking.
He said the crew was in a panic and shouting, and that he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair the dock also helped rescue by inflatable boat that carried passengers ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet).
Aviation Security Network data indicate that 111 people have been killed in the crash of airlines registered in PNG for the past two decades, but neither of them participated in Air Niugini.
An analyst reconstructs the sequence of events on the night a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution closed its case in a retrial against a man accused of burning a living woman in Mississippi in 2014.
American Justice Ministry analyst Paul Rowlett has been testifying for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
In front of the jury, he said he used cell phone records to put together a picture of the defendant Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, and the victim Jessica Chambers, 19 years old, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he got the location data from several phones that show that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which is contrary to his earlier claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was with his own claim with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was out of town that day.
When asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that Chambers met about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis had been able to erase her messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers' death.
He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin presenting the closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he expects a jury trial to take place later in the day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to try to challenge the negative attitude towards this genre by filling its composition with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop has strayed from its beginnings when dealing with political messages and social themes.
They want to go back to their roots and restore popularity to a conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and the Commons are once again gaining popularity in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!!
The New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal after a racist text message.
New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal on a discriminatory basis after mistakenly getting a text message from her mother complaining that she's another black person."
The couple denies being racist, judging the lawsuit as extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed displeasure when she realized that she was the new nurse of children, Giselle Maurice, black.
Not another black woman," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gaff, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was African-American, was doing her job badly and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, was reported by the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a fee for a day's work and an Uber sent home.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for firing him, as well as a $350 fee per day for six months, for how long she was originally hired to live with her family, even though without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she said to the Post on Friday, adding I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to charges of racism that the cancellation of Maurice's involvement was reasonable because they feared that after being insulted, they would not be able to trust her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," he told Post Husband Joel Plasco.
But would you trust your children with someone you offended, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
"Plasco said his wife only got two months of maternity leave and was in a very difficult situation."
You're going after someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although court proceedings are still under way, the public court was swift in condemning the couple on social networks, criticising them for such conduct and reflection.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the readers would not identify with the talking bear, the new letter revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: It is difficult to put someone in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before the little teddy bear inspired him to write a book for the children, worked for the BBC as a cameraman, would still be positive if his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled with both happiness and sadness after his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was a quiet man, he didn't like to brag," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child was achieving something and you're proud of him, even though it wasn't really your doing.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in some way.
Although he was a figment of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say it was bad, and that they did not expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did the same thing.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, baby.
I'll be with you soon, too.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly stopped working and didn't run through her bloodstream anymore.
She died just moments before that and everything went out.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing what was coming.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it together."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now in mourning for her daughter's death, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who never dreamed of the trouble she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I bowed my head, and tears kept running down my face.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed by my sympathy for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The grieving women leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh bridge are putting up cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression to commit suicide when he was 18.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious laugh.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile would light up any room."
However, before he died, he left work because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried it's going to leave a mark."
Mrs. Davis designed those cards so people would know that there's someone you can talk to and even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit and shut up - talk."
Mrs. Humpreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he was moody, depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On Christmas he was at the very bottom - when the children opened their gifts he didn't look them in the eye or anything else."
She says his death to them was a tremendous trauma, but they have to get through it: it leaves a huge gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we will move on and fight."

With the opening of an FBI investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he was looking for -- an investigation of limited duration and scope -- maybe it would unite us somewhat," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears the committee is falling apart" because of irreconcilable party views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their unwillingness is caused by choice of moment.
The elections for Congress are held in only five weeks, on November 6th, and if Republicans go bad, as expected, their attempts to elect their man into the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators on Saturday, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavnaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make his vote and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is dropping under Kim.
The number of defectors from North Korea in South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Referring to the data of the South Korean Ministry of Unity, Park Byeong-seug states that 1127 defectors were recorded last year compared to 2011 when the number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that the two decisive factors are stronger border control between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs people traffickers charge.
Pyongyang didn't go public.
The vast majority of defectors from the north are eventually offered South Korea citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often brings them back.
Relations between the North and the South -- which are technically still at war -- have improved noticeably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss the halted denuclearisation talks.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June, Singapore, where a broader agreement was reached that they would work on denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on the lack of progress so far.
Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security either, and in such circumstances it is out of the question that we are the first unilateral disarmament," RI said in his address at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical," said he was unfit for service at the Supreme Court.
The minority leader at Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives called Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate hysterical" and said that his temper made him unfit for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if you ever acted this way, you would call a woman hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and choking when he talked about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, evaluating him as grotesque and orchestrating an attack on his personality" organised by liberals angry that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform a function in the Supreme Court, as it showed his bias at the expense of the Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he went against the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Asked if she would try to call off Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats got the majority at the House of Representatives, Pelosi backed off.
I'll say this -- if he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's not only fit to be in the Supreme Court, but in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge of District Appellate Court of District Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaughi's possible verdicts against the Accessibility Health Act or Roe v. Wade, as they consider him a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would amend certain Supreme Court decisions.
This is not the time to put a hysterical, biased person in court and to expect us to say if it is not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Justifiable anger, anger that has been gathering for months and years, and it cannot be resolved without crying.
We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: I had a lot of help from a woman who was somewhere the CEO, and who said that she cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that she understood that when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
Tears are allowed a way to vent anger partly and because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from an earlier job, in an office where most of the men were, is how, once I cried because of unspeakable anger, an older woman - a cold boss who I was always a little bit afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and dragged me out to the stairwell.
I never let them see me cry," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be glad because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Moneky Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs Schroeder, deeply frustrated, discovered there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me through a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign had already advanced, it was behind on fundraising, vowing not to enter the race if it did not raise $2m.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000 would only give her $250.
Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so consumed with emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration over a system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and rage over chauvinism -- from which she was held in her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what would they put on my headstone?
She cried?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first canonades of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and until the end of the battle is seen, the rift between countries could long-term benefit Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, US President, fired his first warning early this year by taxing key Chinese export items including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest impact occurred this week with new tariffs that hit $200 billion worth (150 billion) items, which practically tax half of all goods coming in from China.
Beijing fought back each time, and the latest is the introduction of a rate of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed that the United States will respond in the same way, and the second largest global economy seems to be not going to stop soon.
Force Washington to withdraw means meeting demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing makes its next move well, US pressures in the trade war can favour China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the beginning of a steep economic fall in one of those two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready" to return refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals to help rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress achieved against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore a normal life.
Now there are all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditioned assistance or assistance from the rebel countries.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National out of Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown as a team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points that they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, threw the ball into the water with the initial blow on the 16th hole, couple 3, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of the four players who had ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament began in this format in 1997.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 to Throbojorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest ranking European team player.
The world's top ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost two to one to Ian Poulter of England to whom this may have been the last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European tournament winner of all time with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy we won the Cup again.
There is an important team here and I am glad that I could be of help," emotional Garcia said after European victory.
He's handing the relay to his countryman John Ram who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in individual matches on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud of beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and is now holding a career record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time who has won 14 of the greatest titles and is behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled all weekend to find their way to the hole, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, US captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning there were times when we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're outplayed."
