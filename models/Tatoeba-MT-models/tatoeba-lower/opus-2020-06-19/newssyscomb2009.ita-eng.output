The triumph of the right people in Austria: in total 29%
The comprehensive deficit of both parties existing in the large coalition and this strengthenment marked by the right national parties have taken, since the first provisory results, to the parliamentary elections of Dominica in Austria.
The Austrian Popular Party (PEVP), within which the position of the current President Wilhelm Moltrer is seriously vaccinating, has immediately lost strongly.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the trionfale return in the national policy.
According to the provisory results, the strongest party of the country remains the socio-democratic (SPE) with 29,8% of votes, in accordance with the last elections of 2006, but 5,5%.
More worse was gone for OVP, which loss 25,6% of the 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two large parties in the Australian history of Dopoguera, especially the literally catastrophic result of the population, which caused anticipated elections.
In the beginning of July, when the PEVP left coalition, the population had in preferences before SPE.
But the electorers have clearly punished them because they have made the government to face.
In the first reactions on the results, there were speculations on the potential divisions of the President of the Partie, the vice-cancerer Wilhelm Monterer.
The observators believe that they may have already come to the Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the direction of the Partie.
This evolution may facilitate the path to the most probable way of outcome from the electoral result, which is to the renovation of SPÖ and OPP coalition .
With regard to the strengthening of both national parties of rights - and liberal parties (FPÖ), the 18% and the BZÖ on 11% of votes, but socio-democratics opened simultaneously the concern of another 1999, when people agreed with the populations to the collettive government, (the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 separated from the BZÖ), which was added to the reasons for sanctions by the European Union.
On this evolution, of course, Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and take a return to Vienna in the national policy.
The Party of the Green Parties, however, has been able to enter in the Parliament, which has been easily fallen, descending between the Australian political parties from third to the fifth place.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% steel and has not entered into Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Reports with India may be raffredd
If it was not possible to resolve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of the crawl collection in India, it would be according to the Ministry of Chess Foreigners Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain refrigeration of the Czech Reports.
The Ministry reported this to New York after the meeting today with his Indian Omologe Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it would not be resolved, then, that would be a certain raffred," he stated after the meeting that he had been place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that the executive power can hardly enter into the legal factors.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Peter Swacha, which was committed by ‘abusion and punished with a lot, the central government can negotiate with the local in Dardjeeling that is falling under his jurisdiction.
"Your problem may be resolved," said the Ministry.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Kučara condemned at three years of prison, to return to a ‘a higher insurance.
Then you can ask freedom on caution and wait for the judgment in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner was expressed in the same way during negotiations.
"Recommends the review to the Supreme Court then will be possible to obtain grace," said the chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way you can enter the Czech Party is to provide the judges the "competent jurisdiction", he supported the Indian Ministry.
At the same time, he said that a kind of support is already in the Indian part.
"We have the most interested in maintaining the best relations that are trained for many years with India.
They also accept the Indians," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to the CTK, before his partner, he underlined that the Czech Republic gives great importance to the problems of the Czech Entomology.
"We really consider a deep mistake of the reclusion and the accusation of these citizen scientists," he said.
The Minister has refused to answer the question if he has received the promise to take care of the matter from India.
"I have obtained relatively much promises," he just stated.
A Czech Court in the battle for marine fundamental
They are close to the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent sea zones are drawn.
But it is not interested in the continent but a small loss point in the blue of the ocean.
“L’insel is the ‘Australia’ and together with her the sea-based age.
The area is at the same time large as the continent himself, says the “Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 employees of the United Nations Division for the issues on the ocean and maritime rights.
His boss, the Chess Director of the Division, Vaclav Mikulka, follows his exposition and adds something.
It gives the desire to work and ‘entusiasm’.
The sea fundamental is still hiding a little known world of natural resources.
It’s possible to find the pet, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also unknown living organisms until now bringing the key for the detection of the medicine against the cancer.
The largest foundation of the terraferm
Cost states have started to provide interest in the submarine territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they apply the laws on which they have made a agreement in Montgo Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
It is particularly the area of this continent platform that often extends to several hundreds of kilometres from the cost of the state concerned.
This is, according to the Convention, a exclusive law on all the resources of the continent platform.
"In a few words for continent platforms, the part of the sea fundamental and its subsurse that is a natural prolongation of the continent under the sea.
The such exclusive economic area is often extended from the territory sea, often over 200 miles of nauticals," explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country is presented before the Commission for the definition of the dimensions of the continental platform must be associated with a technical-scientific documentation very large based on many research and cost measurements.
It’s the result of a preparation of many years.
"One of our committees is to look for the Commission for a legal and professional assistance.
The committee has been treated for five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the three last names have been successful," adds Mikulka.
The recent success of the ‘Australia’ who has noticed its marine possessions has registered a world eco.
But also the New Zealand has guaranteed us - the surface of the sea basis, which has been assigned to her by the Commission last week, of about 1,6 square miles, so more or less than six times greater than the same state.
All and two countries have invested in the research of millions of dollars.
The benefit, which will produce him in the future from the sea fundamental, as they are promised, will be unvaluable.
Others will also be presented gradually their requests.
They can do this for ten years since it was ratified "the convention of Montego Bay".
Where the continent platform ends, the area of the ocean fund begins that the Convention has declared a common country of the ‘humanity’.
Now nobody has a exclusive position.
The ruling right in this area is authorised by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Fund is not Klondike," says the Director Mikulka, "the fact that its individual parties are legally demarked and their contractual regime."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the sea basis is today also to the Czech Republic.
If it is scattered with other states of the ‘ex Sovietic block’ in the ‘the common organization ‘Interoceanmetal’.
This has purchased in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as investors of few other States, the status of the "Pinie Investor".
He has the right of extraction in the area ClarionClipperton in the “extern Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the ‘investitor’ and a little larger than the ex Cecoslovacchia.
The background is frastalled, it's a nearly submarine replica of Tatry.
"E" can be extracted on the total surface of 75,000 square miles.
The area is a rich jail of polimetal agglomery containing nigel, rame, cobalt and manage," explains another Indian advocat Pakshi Rajan.
A employer of the Division of Macedonia Rober Sandev brings a repair to show it.
It looks like a small patate or with a foot of fantasy, a legacy of skim, as in the law of Golem's review.
German special units were presented to the release of residues
The Egyptian government had requested aid to Germany for the freedom of residents — the experts came then.
When the situation became critical, special units were ready, but they were not intervented.
On the circumstances of the liberation of 11 followed European stages, we have always received more detailed information.
On the saving operation as stated by the Ministry of Defence and the Internal have participated in the German special units.
Furthermore, the specialists of the army were presented by the GSG9 units, the aviation federal police, the federal criminal office, as well as the logistical experts of the technical institution.
As it has reported the portfolio of the Monday Ministry, German units have not been intervented because the sequencers, since the danger of a force intervention have released the residues running.
The Egyptian Government accepted the aid offered by Germans to join as a direct assistance on the place.
"We haven't come fortunately," says a portfolio of the internal ministry.
The aggressors took a group of travellers in the south of Egypt on 19 September: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romania as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the rap in a wilderness area in the south of Egypt, the residue were deported into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudano and Ciad.
The identity of the recipers until the end remains secret, as well as the details of the freedom or the possible payments of sale.
The freedoms at the same time arrived in good conditions to Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the free residents are under the protection of the German embassy.
He was not explained about the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin, for when they were returned to Germany.
According to the "Image" journal, 5 vacancies and special units should go fly with a Airbus of the military aircraft and come to March to Germany.
American representation room respirates the saving package.
The first room of the American Congress has just made a failure of 700 million dollars for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 votes to 227, the American representative house has repeated the Government's saving package for financial markets.
Instead of the calls of the President of the United States George W. Bush and the first plan of both parties were not a majority for the programme, with which it should be argued the case of financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters tried disasterly to persecute critics from 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the treaty leaders, invited the deputy to consensus, even if the plan was involving.
8. It is difficult to be recognised to avoid something, which has not yet come.
While the suffering of Down Jones was rounded over 6% or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the State Safety Package would have fallen.
It was repeated before the end of the vote, after the announcement of the falling, to cross again.
Experts are now waiting for other serious tourbolences on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force is necessary that it has the benefit of the deputy room and of the senate.
The promotors register cigarettes increasing prenotations
It seems to be a good wind for the German tourist operators:
According to a study, the fatturated on travel prenotations for the next months in comparison to the previous year has increased in clearly - for the winter stage additive of more than 30%.
Without deficiencies, the desire of traveling Germans stands to an investigation remains sold.
On the notations for the winter station, the travel agencies have registered one more of the factors of 31 % in respect of the same period of the previous year , as he did to know the German association for the DRV tourism in Berlin on Monday.
According to the investigation of the GfK market research institute, there are also increased quotes of notification already for the Sunday months.
Therefore, the absence of travel agencies for October in relation to 2007 would be mounted to 11% around, he communicated the DDRV.
Presumed for these results are the numbers of GfK, which analyses monthly the data of notification of German travel agencies and sets statistical projects for the whole market.
In addition, the travel prenotations would be done until the end of August 2008.
Because of the severe quotation of the dollar, particularly the travels in the United States, the DDR refers to the DRV.
Here the increase of prenotations would be added to a third round.
They would also be particularly required by the Germans Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as internal location in Germany.
In particular, all travels include a high quotation, he explained the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
Considering the increased costs for energy and food generes, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for clients than for a individually organised vacation."
Consumers could pay money through, among others, shoes for prenotations made with strong anticipation or offered with all of them, explained Laepple.
Moreover, the present months would have registered a positive notation cycle, as respectively the year before, it would be reregistred a event of the facture - even if the number of Germans who have entered a travel, in contrast to the previous year has gone along with another study.
My first time at Octoberfest
Hits di Ballermann, the birds of the mouths and a litro and vip in Dirndln.
A debut to Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I have actually not very common.
You're bionda, TV moderative and inserts a Dirndl made on measure .
I have the scarlet hairs, I'm students, and my clothes are second hand.
But one thing agrees to us: just three minutes in Wiesn, the photos are already launched against us and scat photos until the memory of photos is very lushing, and this is my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how friends do.
The Director of two money seems to get his goal.
As the tourist of the Wiesn and resident actually at the north of the equator of the white salts, the meaning of welcome in the cost/about until today remains still in the limits.
But once I came to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everybody brings the Dirndl or the pill pantalons; no one looks disgusted or imbarcated – everything perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's grembile collects strange looks at the banana station at the chicococa.
A monacense makes me note that I would throw the grembile in wrong way: "A left you are free, in the centre of six virgins, on the right side of you, behind the widow."
I'm sure I'm able to fix the floor behind the left.
It's okay, he's ridiculous.
Others do small skins of technology from flirt and indoss supply of flirting capsules, on which heads "To drunk to get dressed!" and stirred the node to the uninvited.
The boy with exhibitional inclinations is named Bob, comes from England and also visits Octoberfest for the first time.
It's "gorgeous", with a strashed "ooooo".
This tells me, after he's released from his mouth of bird from a litro drinking before.
Exactly close to one of these hydrogens, of which everyone thinks to be a path.
Bob is one of these famous "Wildbiesler".
Others do not have the luck to free from the alcohol in this way.
By 8 nights, they walk white on the party's place, the healthers who have to take care of the poor beauty
The sisters walk every time in white – always 4 once a covered tent bar.
This works as with most of the visitors of Wiesn: it's empty, it's fully returned.
He who walks under the telone in this bar of alcohol in the blood, doesn't see.
"They're those where the guarnimmer packages," cried one of the sanitarians and shot in the baraon.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year woman died in hospital after a vehicle was invested while she walked to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the wednesday accident on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was brought to Queen's hospital, to Romford, but she's dead a little later.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with the accusation of disadvantage guidance.
It was released on caution.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic origins
Moreover, before Turkey was trying to enter into the European Union, the European powers were encouraged to penetrate in depth in Turkey.
In the east part of Bosforo, maybe 20 steps in Asia, one of the most beautiful remains of this false imperial ambition.
The station of Hydarpasha train was designed by two German architectures Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-rinascimental style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building is in horses between the end of the platforms with a tour on each of his angles looking at the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is smoke.
The whole building is lowly decadeous.
But once in the office tickets from the suffit once, there is no doubt about the largest business that was the most west pass.
The station was opened in August 1908 from a German consorce, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retard to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this ferrovia that runs to Damasco, Baghdad and more in that which is the Saudi Arabia today.
However, the imperial ambitions of Germany were struck during the first world war.
His ferrovies were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his illegal Arabians.
The related isolation from the area, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed.
British and dominant forces went out from Egypt and spread the Turkeys and their German associates outside Palestinian and Syria.
And there were too bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train of municipalities destructed his team.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then he went lately into disface, longly over the story.
But today, this ferroviary shock for Anatolia and all the east points, they serve - at least symbolicly - to demonstrate the diplomatic origins always greater than Turkey.
The Governing Party of Justice and Development - the ACP - has created a whole new external policy for the country.
The related isolation of its circumstances, generated by frozen borders of the cold war, has passed.
Now there is a new commitment policy.
The Turkish Government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factors of Hammas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to estimate the parameters of this new external policy, I have been bought on the league for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the major experts of external policy of the AKP, the Turkish President Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about 10 hours and half after - after a cut to subtracts long-term tracks that produce the old world cadens of the famous documentary The Night Mail, have arrived in Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for an earlier state intended to turn the pads back to its oopamian past.
But the AKP with its well known islamic roots represents an exemplary movement in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the West, most preciously in Washington.
A taxi brings me in the general AKP quarter, an ultra-moderna structure of stone and aceio - built to hoc - in a sub-development supply, rounded by trade centres built and pastics of power, where managers in full of business - both men and women - are meetings to make contracts first morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right policy of almost every other European political party.
Complete, cravatta, I'm sure there was a Blackberry too.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its neighbors.
The cold war was an anomaly," says he.
Turkey has been cut out of her inside.
Today you need to look at east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or another.
They should be both.
"Maybe sure to a certain point," I ask, "Turkey will be required to decide?"
"Turkey," says, "I don't want to face that choice."
Then he sublines a point that almost all of those who have spoken here have been receipt: the legs of the Middle East not only with the Caucase, and all around the Black Sea are beneficial to Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey.
With Turkey at the ground, the message seems to be, the whole Europe can metaforically travel those ferroviary lines through Asia and the Middle East.
Once again to the Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think to those two German nations, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had observed this building built 100 years ago.
How much it would be surprised to find that the media-oriental ambitions of Europe may now be, in the hands of Turkey.
And while I look at the terminal for the tragedy that brings me back through the Bosfore, I remember that Turkey has always been called "the sick man in Europe."
Then, at least, it seemed not to be doubtful about which continent had to progress in this worse country.
Quite reminder: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as a musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, 11 September) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the core.
As a member of his music scheme for municipality, the next year he founded his wonderful youth core, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21/ under 21 years, but when the Proteus singed his end in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we just refused to reject the core.
The name "Proteus" (the mitological being-mutable) represented the good will of the core and the ability to face all that music had to do, or madrigals and Messiaen, without accommodation or with all the orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young core was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the entusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constantly through the years.
How often it was told us by Todd to "lise that it's the music to speak for himself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything in the music.
So sing it!"
His technology in the use of the bacchette was absolutely clear and necessary, even though no ditatorial or floor.
Although it was the musical standard, he always made it higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If you should have named an orchestra director would be Vernon Handley.
I knew it very well during the two decades where Guildford Philharmonic led from 1962 to 1982.
During the past 40 years and more I have considered more than 100 of his concerts, and I can say honestly that I have never been disappointed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Todd Handley had that amazing combination of personal and modesty.
He hated orchestra directors that, in his words, just "cavaled around the world one or two horses of good news."
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your neurologist of William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 renewed to study economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houble-Norman... studying at the same time for a laugh in science, a letter and a PhD."
This results from the note of the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not correct.
Since 1946 to 1953, a university of economic story at the University of Nottingham was fulfilled in that period a PhD technology on the British industry of the gomma, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industrie.
1950-51 in the United States as a researcher in Houble-Norman, and the east of 1952 to the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for the Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his carrier, he doesn't know.
J. Vincent Resino to Philology Faculty
"Recommending the show of Joseph Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life", because his photos in white and black, in documentaristic style, are amazing.
They have taken my attention to the simplyness and strength that they transmit, even treating protagonists with particular respect.

Reino can catch magic moments."
Second assumption for Honda's overseers
In November, Honda will be the marketing of the second generation of Jazz model.
If the previous model has already been given a large habitation, this new monovolume has a larger internal space.
To all, it will add a raffined mechanical, which increases the comfort of guidance and allows you to resume carburant.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Even though the new Jazz presents a very similar line of the previous model, changes in this monovolume are numerous.
between others, it is the penalty to report an innovative design, a new platform, larger and new mechanical sizes.
However, before you go to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz has come six years after entering the market of the first generation.
Thus, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter times respect to those used by other producers.
Although the Jazz model in Europe is less known as in other markets, there is a single phenomenon in fact of selling.
It is exactly the case of Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also in this 2008.
Just in Japan, almost a million of Jazz units were sold since the starting time.
The second market was the old Continent, with about half million units in six years.
Instead of these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase the sale in the segment.
So, if Japan's society sold a total of 83,000 units of this model in 2007, the estimates will be added around 100,000 car rentals, supposing a increase of 17% in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which correspond to 6,7% of the total of Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation, the responsibilities for the Spanish office are expected to sell around 2,000 Jazz units in the ark of a year.
Exactly, the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda .d to reduce good measures the price of sales in Spain.
In fact, the responsibilities of the company are required to be achieved at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 sold units, at least 4,000 in 2007, with a rate of 16%.
Although the increase in the sale of Honda increased its market quota in Spain, increased by 1,8% before 1,6% of the last year.
Moreover, Japan's company expects to get 2% in 2010.
To get us, Honda trusts the arrival of another new model.
It's about Insight, a hybrid to five gates and a compatible format - 4,37 meters of length - of which Japan's company hopes to sell about about 200,000 units per year in the whole world.
For the markets and according to the values of the Japanese producer, 50% of the Insight's sales will be located in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be subdivided between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is provided for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in society in January in Valencia.
In respect of the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
His length is at 3,90 meters (5 centimeters in more), the width of 1,69 meters (two centimeters in more) and the interest at 2,50 meters, with a increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained invariated at 1,52 meters.
Same to the increase of dimensions, the entire inner is also expanded.
This benefit was from one side from the insertion of a new platform, and from the introduction of the carburant in central position, a solution adopted also in the previous Jazz model.
Furthermore, the capacity of the bathroom – double ground - sale to 399 litres, of course, 19 litres more of the capacity of the first generation.
It has reported that these are the measures of the version 1.4 of the engine, and that the capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liter.
Other improvements - except for external elements, such as the behind leds or the possibility of mounting the panorama veterinary - relates to a improvement in fact of accessibility to the behind seats.
The doors that allow the access to the following positions were opened with a angle of 80 degrees in respect of 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Furthermore, the engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
In the time of commercialization, this small model will be proposed in models with benzine engines from 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Mechanisms include the VTEC technology that allows to discharge consumption, produce less carbon biooxide emissions, optimize the mechanical and at the same time maintains the company of the engine in all its stages.
The model of 1.2 litres allows us to use a power of 90 cv to 6000 rounds with a maximum 114 Nm to 4.900 rounds.
The propulsion – that Jazz had 78 horses – use 5,3 litres of carburant and produce CO2 emissions at about 125 grams.
Regarding the previous propulsion, which used 83 horses in the first generation model, now are 100.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses gets a combination of 5,4 litres of carburant and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The Car Ape to prevent collisions
In the development of the technologies for the prevention of incidents, Nissan has inspired this time, natural, and particularly for api.
The Japanese society has created a robot that, for example, takes the air of api, can avoid accidents.
It's the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, even the first step to the prevention technology of collisions.
Ingegners of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for the Scientific and Technology of the Prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Reports for Technology and Search and Development of Brand Management, BR23C constitutes an extension of the Security Square of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is destined to improve the capacity to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturer house.
During the air, each ape creates its personal space in oil form that is very similar to the Nissan security scudo.
But the most important thing is the composite eyes of the ape, in order to see in all directions with an angle above 300 degrees, and that allows them to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recrease this visual function, the engineers have set the point of what they defined a location laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the residues that are in the front of BR23C for a range within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance in respect of the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that immediately can prevent collision.
"In the moment that it refers to a steel, the small robot impresss the movements of a steel and changes immediately the direction rounding on the roads to a right or greater angle to avoid collision.
The most evident difference with any assisted system is that the evasion manufacturer is absolutely essential.
"If it was not so, the robot would not be able to react with enough speed to lose the restles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and ingegner the head of this project.
In other ways, the robot can't move to high or low, and even in diagonal; it can be moved only in two sizes and directions in which they can turn their roads and not use infinite directions and ways as they do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, besides acceleration and decreasing, so that the small robot can prevent collisions.
"This device only needs to elaborate information every few seconds, and to act from these data.
You don't require saving information or intuitive logic of the previous hands, so you can work without interruptions and only a couple of KB memory dozens.
This can be surprised, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, and even of Mega."
It's the first step to development of new technologies for the standing prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will be serious in cars for ten years.
The robot uses battery for litio polymers, which are more read and harder respect to the typological ions of litio.
Another potential application of this technology may be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to destination by disappearing the rests present in the path.
Trema before asking a pressure
We must recognize that the Department of the United States Department, besides having many capitals to intervene, is not really an ingest price.
In the presence of the crisis and to prevent that the Americans are involved with mutual space in banks in doubt insolvency, they have created a funeral and educative game for users of the network: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Credit Hotel" or the problems.
The aspect of this system and, in particular, its receipt serves to indulge to think not one, but two or three times before asking a prestige.
And, in particular, where to do it, that probably is the primary goal.
Of course, the information that the game provides is useful, but it is little detailed.
It's more a page for young people than a public wide site.
What happens if the game is completed?
Well, compare a dream room inside the hotel.
It's always something, for buying a better house, it's not even talking...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital in MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the subscription of an agreement with the UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a total of 21% of participation in the company, the news resulted after a net reach of its actions in Borsa.
One week after a provisory agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy the 9,9% of Morgan Stanley's assionary titles at the individual cost of $25,25, or a total of $3 billion.
The fixed price is less than 19% of the accountable value of the titles at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of tickets to a conversion price of 31,25 dollars, ensuring a reward of 10%.
Morgan Stanley needed that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars, even a percentage lower than its current currency of 28%.
At 17.00 the title of Morgan Stanley, however, was sent from 6,79% to 23.07 dollars.
"This strategic cohesion constitutes an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition in bank holding company," explains John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow them to distinguish its actions, however, through the control of the Federal Reserve.
His partnership with the MUFG confirms also how the current financial crisis costs the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a very careful approach than that matter before.
The procedures defined on Monday show also that in the last days the agreement was amended: last Monday, Morgan just announced the sale of 20% of its actions to the Japanese colosure for a total of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshide Mizuno , executive director of the MUFG, he explained: "We thought our participation quote would be exclusively composed of regular actions.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and to tute us."
On the basis of the average price, MUFG will open the titles of Morgan Stanley to a lower price than their accountable value of 7%.
And the operation would be translated with a investment of at least 20% of the equity on the dilute basis."
The Agreement provides that the MUFG can convert the half of its preferences in regular actions for a period of time, these recently have been changed over 50% under the fixed conversion price, even at about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital brought by the MUFG would allow you to collect investment opportunities, to strengthen its budget and to increase its liquidity.
However, a portrait of the group refused to provide precautions on the strategic projects of two new additives.
After the investment of the MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Coefficient of Solubility Life on Earth One at about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have "exactly" his budget from the end of August.
In the last weeks, the group has made a hard test, which has seen to reduce the value of its actions while the cost of ensure against risks has immediately been infected.
The cost of the lunch flow, however, remaining at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, the Goldman Sachs, the only one's superstite" between the large investment banks of Wall Street after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the review of Merrill Lynch, announced that he had 15 billion dollars, in part to Berkshire Hathaway, a group of Warren Buffett.

The scrutiny, which has been carried out in peace, according to the electoral observation mission of the United States (EEA), was based on a text of 444 acts to consolidate the "new socialism" defenced by the President.
This project of the Constitution sanctifies the power of the state on the economy, retaining the "paining of development" of a country who lives essentially from the petholifer exploited by large strange companies and consequently of their value.
Concept by Correa, elected in 2006, the draft agrees further to the head of the State, which will be chosen for two follow-up mandates of four years, will have the possibility of cutting the assembly.

The Constitution also states the gratitude of health and education services, which the President began to promote in this country of 13,9 million residents, where 50% of the population lives under the poverty soil.
It also takes the presence of stranger arms, disposal that will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an ecuadorian base as a point of partition for American antidroga operations.
At 19 feet free in Ciad
A Egyptian command has launched the assault of the ten tourists and their eight partners followed ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptians held prisoners in the wilderness for ten days have been reported on Monday, health and safe, in the Egyptian capital.
On the morning, they were released in Ciad from a Egyptian command.
Apparently, the residences have arrived to the Almaza military base, in the nearby of the International Airport of Cairo, at the 15 and 30, at the border of a special airport.
On the border of an electronic, they were transferred immediately, unable to release any interview to the pressure, Madi's hospital, a resident perifery of Cairo, to be submitted to analysis.
Got 'Good Health' and was not paid any reserve "al sequestrators", he stated on the track of the Egyptian Minister of Turismo, Zoheir Garanna.
I was at 19 September during a safari in 4x4 at the feet of the mount Ouanat, bordering with Egypt, Sudan and Libia, this group of residues was broken by a hidden to 35 unknown sequencers.
The group was formatted by 11 tourists – five Italian, five German and a Romanian – and of 8 Egyptians: two guides, four authors, a frontguard and the egiptom director, the organizatory agent of safari.
A Egyptian responsible for security stated that 30 members of the special forces, at the border of two electronics, had launched the assets during the night, little before the alba.
"They have been shoes, half of the sequencers have been killed, while others have been escaped," said the responsible one who has requested to keep the anonim.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lampo" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would support German and Italian commands.
The Italian Minister Franco Frattini sublineed the importance of the role of the secret agents and the Italian special forces.
We must recognize that if we have received this result, the professionality and the efficiency of the men of our secret services, the special forces," he stated, without adding further details.
He also forgot the payment of a rescue.
On the first day, the Southern Army of Pattull had stated that he had intercepted a vehicle 4x4 on the ground of which the sequencers were found and had killed six, including the chadian leader of the rapiers, and had taken two captures.
According to the army, the sequestrators would be linked to an organization of rebels of Darfur, the movement for the Liberation of the Sudan, (SLA_U), a statement immediately mentioned by this last.
Letter-The most silence of the culture
First page, a debate on the financing of the culture on which the current electoral campaign is concentrated.
That's better.
But one part of our cultural life remains in the shadow.
Who will be proclaimed to declare the summary concessions to small museums, archives, archeological scales or national history places that make hungry?
What policy will wear to the federal government that is cutting monuments and patriotic buildings?
What in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have real and own laws that actually keep our patrimunity?
Did you know that the French government verses three million and half euros for the only restaurant of the castle of China, in the valley of Loira?
Before our neighbors of the United States, the Constitution is to say that the protection of the country is part of the national culture and that the same country must be taken by every citizen, by every political authorities and by every government department, and all this of the common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of the History Society of Quebec, there are at least 400,000 volunteers that, grouped in 211 companies for the protection of historical, genealogic, archives and goods, were maintained, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are actually those who, often, defend our country, who protest with the energy of the desperce when immobiliers and decisional officers attack our rests and cimits forgotten with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved to the history and to the country?
The Governments of Benelux are a part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states help the Belgian Fortis Bank in part nationalization, which has finished first in Europe for the crisis of the American credit market: three nations will provide 11,2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interests in Hungary.
The Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and Olanda at the end of the week have been agreed at the maximum level, also involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission for competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the area of difficulties in which the international financial market is the Fortis bank, and the decisions adopted in respect of the case may be a previous.
In accordance with the Sunday Decision, all and three states will have nearly half (49%) of the current bank's quota in the country.
The bank will almost sell part of its interests, including before all the assets, especially insurance, of the Netherlands ABN Amro a year ago.
Last week, the actions of Fortis had started with a vertical crowl, serious crisis signs of the institution were submitted afterwards in the second half of the week.
However, analysts are agreed to think that the bank, with 85,000 dependents, is too big to allow them to go into a fall.
Wednesday bank actions have fallen almost 12%, the less than 14 years.
Since January, the value of actions is reduced more than two thirds.
Considering the current prices of actions the total capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank managers this value is not real.
The company highlights the role of Fortis actions to the insurance of the European External Market, which must be accepted by the American plan of 700 billion dollars.
On Monday, the title repeated lately to go.
Wednesday Philip Dierckx was named a new delegated bank manager.
The financial institution has also searched private purchases, but no one has been presented with a merciful offer.
The Belgian government had already ensure that investors should not be afraid to lose the money.
The bank customers have not been divorced, the officers have not been assumed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has autonome offices and has also buyed leasing offices.
The vol in Poland
In America, the insurance providers on life and health, based on the data of medical acquisition of people, often refuses to establish a security contract.
Privacy Experts fear that the data market becomes uncontrolled.
"It is a private programme according to the use of the medicine prescription data depends on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like to trust the pole to the volpe" - writes Washington Post by quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the medicine.
Insurance companys subordinate the insurance target and the spent number in case of left-lines to the health state of the event of the customer and if the risk is too high, they do not establish the safety.
The client had to be submitted to a medical visit before, and the contract was established only after the exit of the test.
Dick has invented a greater economic procedure for 10 years ago: based on the customer's identification code, you can easily have information from the medicines on which medicine has buyed in the last year and half, and from this program evince what diseases are suffering and where health conditions are found.
For example, if regularly buying large quantities of colesterol reductors, it means that the level of grass in blood is in the use of inequality high and is classified in the higher risk category.
In commerce there are several versions of the programme, some also determine the risk multiple, therefore the assessment is not very much, even though small difficulties are presented.
There are some medicines that are used for more purposes, for example, some compounds are inevitable against emergency or hot campaigns, but they are also effectively against depression.
This last, from the insurance point - trade, value as risk increase factor, the first two points.
For the request and elaboration of data, the companies are formed partly and these, before they receive the necessary information from the medicine, they request the approval of the patient.
The authorities are now obligated to do it even if they have not yet affected much for the negligencies.
Some recently develop the result of laboratory tests and link them to medical consumption data to provide a more precise image than the health state of patients.
Always more difference have access to data and parallelly the use control will always be more difficult.
There is part of a law on the privacy, but its validity is only extended to health services and insurance.
There is a legislative proposal before the Congress, which gives the competent control authorities to the specialized undertakings in data service.
Richard Dick agrees that it is not enough: therefore he developed a program that links the data with the approval expressed by the interested person.
Another question is that the interested person cannot so much deny the approval, for otherwise, the assurers do not establish the contract.
So then, at the end, the gallines are trusted to the clemence of the volpe.
Global Marsilence Menu
The European Union and India are radically duplicate of trade
Since the European Union and India are partners who trade in particular reciprocally, even the agenda of the nine meeting on the top has been dominated by this subject, besides all other global problems.
Today there will be a France-Indian highlight that will be trained in the first place of cooperation on the atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes the fact that India becomes a great democratic power to which it should be voted more in international businesss, but the Member States have not yet been able to decide whether to approve or not New Delhi as a permanent member in the United Nations Security Council.
So he didn't insist on this issue in the nine-summit organised yesterday in Marsilla.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana high representative of the foreigners have received the first Indian Ministry Manmohan Singh, with which they have found the Agreement to drop up in five years, that increases to 100 billion euro, the trade.
As regards that between 2000 and 2007 the market change has been exceeded from 25 to 55 billion, this is not too ambitial.
Therefore, they uniformed the 26 bilateral civil air agreements from legal view, so the air traffic can also take the way in future.
In the end of 2009, India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to raise the agreement.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is the first trade partner in India, New Delhi is only the ninth place between the EU partners.
The highlight has dedicated attention to global factors.
In the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the terrorism, this last condemned in all its forms of both parties, and they deserved the convocation of a Conference of the United Nations.
They have expressed the conclusion of Doha Round, even though both parties have had a role in the fall of this.
The EU has confirmed to continue in the energy and climate programme, although it would want to reduce at least 20% in 2020 the emissions of nocifous substances.
In addition, India is agreed on this, as well as on the fact that a global agreement should be established to the conference on the climate programmed for the next year and reducing 50% in 2050 the production of serra gas.
They also want to raise the increase of the prices of food products and support the convocation of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India today will be in France capital where a bilateral meeting will be prepared to sign a Treaty on the peaceful use of the atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that in order to build Indian nuclear reactors, the French statements received a share of 20 billion euro value.
According to the information of our print agency, the Agreement will be 15 years.

I found Steve Fossett's airport, the billionary lost a year ago
It was found the relimit of Steve Fossett Airlines, the billionary lost on 3 September 2007 while he was flying to the wilderness of Nevada.
The roads were returned to a high-pipe to 3000 meters high, in the area of Sierra Nevada of Mammoth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the bullet, but there were no human remains.
The officer of the Madera County, John Anderson, fled the doubts remaining: "The air is located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that is exactly about what Steve Fossett was flying on the day when she was lost," he said in an print conference.
The sheriff therefore needed that it was not human residence, nor in the air, nor in the area of circumstances.
The 63-year billion officer was given for death in February.
The American Office for Transport Security (Ntsb) has made it known that some hours after the report was sent a team of inquirents, which then identified the device: it is exactly from Bellanca 8kcab, split from 3 September 2007, when Fossett decolled from Yerington in Nevada for three hours.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the border of Nevada, some personal effects of Fossett were returned from a copy in their apartment of Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, of money in account and of a seller.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his loss.
The billionary was buyed a place in the history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, in the sixth trial, the first man became to complete the world around on a aircraft palle: two weeks of air in solitary.
Three years later, he made the world in air and without scale.
Through his many records, even what he had flyed to 15,445 meters of height, above Ande, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with a original design and well defined by decisive lines, wide surface and net angles.
It's this, in sins, Glk the last born among the "compatible" offers of the star's house with Mercedes-Benz tried to give a twenty news in this sector.
Apparently for its contents outside traditional canons, it will be unexpected and not convenional, even the communication that will comply with the launch of Suv Glk, available at the showroom Mercedes-Benz from the next 17 October.
Thus, the public battage that will comply with the debut of the new vector will also have an inevitable mode of communication through a futuristic campaign in 3D, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi-assions, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the centralest way of the Millennium shoping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special eyes distributed near Corso How can you see the new Suv in almost real and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking on the image will be the impression that the car goes out from the manifestation.
Successfully, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8, the new Glk will be lighted in different times in all its details, and then returned in a single image.
In doubt, Mercedes with this publicity is trying to introduce something again into the stereotype field of the automobile communication.
Will you be able to make this formula to fix the interests of the future purchased?
Here are the Italian Hooligans
The Triveneto risks the Despo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all Italy are now confused? They are part of the "Ultras Italy" group that follows years of the blue National and that, for truth, has never created excessive problems.
He's never confronted with the adversary tiphoses.
The explosion of the group is right.
The promotors come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These are added to Sofia groups (in fact, units) from Campania and Pulia.
There are three-color bands where the cities of military origins are coming: Saturday night they were taken to not be identified.
They inspired the English tiphoseries.
In Bulgaria they found a real nazistic tiphosery, the Levski.
The Figc had placed the Italian tifos 144 bigliets for the game: all nominatives, so easily controlable.
And the Viminale had controlled them all: among those who went to Sofia there was no one with a incoming Depose, no one who had been committed by the frequency of a stadium.
In four asylum tiphoses, which had previous stadium retailed, was refused to be rejected because the letter and stopped the transfer.
Now Viminale waits for reading the acts that will come from Bulgaria police then will take provisions: in this case, it is possible to give the Depth for at least five years to the tiphoses who were arrested or to who was identified in disorders.
A international depth that refuses to frequency not only the Italian stages but all Europe.
Our hooligans, however, will not make any more feet in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now there's the fear-emulation: that's what to those few more than hundred fifty, they're added to others.
"We need to shoot this fire immediately and not legitimate who does this way," they suffer from Viminale.
So, "You're very well open, especially in view of the National Market Game in Lecce."
In Pulia, there is a small nuclear nuclear of supporters of the Ultras Italian.
Tomorrow, the Observatory is meeting, marted the Casms, which can also count on a Section of Aise, which is of the secret services, which are very concerned with the stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce cores and the brain tired during Mameli's finger?
This is the thought (expressed very little happy way) of Domainico Mazzilli, a few weeks from the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was first from Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was in the past trieste, where there is a nuclear supporter of the Ultras Italian group, based in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not rejected to income in Duce, but the conduct of those 150-200 tiphosis has been worried.
"I don't do the sociologist - add 1.1 of the Observatory - the retails are assigned to the country in which the fact is happening.
Even now, this group was left in line, now we will see what happened, and we will assess for the future.
But we also talk about fish at Mameli's finger: they are not reacted, but if you allow me, they are not education."
