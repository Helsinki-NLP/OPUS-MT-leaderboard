His prohibition would be the right return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of unnamed religious and cultural goods in England, committed by his purite parlians, such as fanatic talibans.
However, the Cromwell Society judges the proposal of Mr. Crick 'derisionable' and qualified it as "revisionist trial".
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that, “see the current debate around the stages, it was clear that the Oliver Cromwell stretched before the Westminster Palais would not be exhausted.
Cromwell didn't order the iconoclasm in English civil wars.
It is likely that he had sacrificed his person for actions made by his ancient Thomas during the past century.
The superper representation of Cromwell, excused by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, test of the consideration that we had for him in the 19th century and are the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr Goldsmith states the following proposals in Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, probably at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressures, I mean the sure monarchie.
The fact that this representation is precise or not an historical debate.
That is true, that the conflict that stressed in the middle of the XVII century has developed the last development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognisible figure that represents a side of the fracture.
His fulfillments as the Lord Protector also provides to be sublime and remembered. ”

The company calculated the number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other strings that discharge the process, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.

"Don't look forward, look at me," leads one of the women.
"Do you really believe he says the truth?
You hold the power when many women are demonished. ”
Before the doors of the assessment were referring, Flake stated that his office had published a statement and that it would appear more at the meeting of the Commission.
All challenges of chain and radiodiffused network chains would cover the meeting directly for a few hours later, while the Court of Justice was prepared to vote the procedure to prevent the nomination of Kavanaugh throughout the Senat.
However, Flake indicates that an investigation of a week should first be carried out by the FBI on the accusations made with the candidate, which would recognize minority democracies.
Flake left a part of convince in discussing with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He took his decision after he had been interacted with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice was severe in the balance, because the Republics had not really obtained the votes that allowed Kavanaugh's nomination without a preliminary investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate the sexual accusations of Brett Kavanaugh.

We are five weeks of one of the most important elections of our life.

The Working Party is not the big community than he was.
It's not tolerant to those who express their ideas
When an activist of the movement Moment of my local party voted to censure me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last line of Parliamentars of the Working Party considered as not the welcome.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has received the same treatment because she has been exalted against anti-semitism.
I was census because I was disappointed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are the subjects for which Jeremy himself was dealing with the previous leaders.
The notification for the collection of Nottingham East Laborday said: “We want to be included and productive.”
It was exactly what the general assemblies of Friday for my eight years as Parliamentary of the Working Party.
Unfortunately, this is not the case of many collections, and the promise of more deep and more respective policies is forgotten since long, if it has ever been taken into consideration.
It was obvious that the contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged in accordance with its acceptability by the leaders of the Partie.
This has started a little while after Jeremy's power, and the colleagues with which I thought to share the same political vision began to wait for me to return my clothes and to take positions to the opposition of my convictions, which is regarding the national security or the internal market of the EU.
Every time I talked publicly, and it was not important to what I said, it followed abusive tattoo on social networks, calling to the retail, denunciating the policies of the center, saying that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
Furthermore, I have more chance than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were addressed to me were political nature.
I am surprised before the professionalism and the definition of these colleagues, which face a deference of sexists or racists every day, but they don't fall down their arms.
One of the most desirable things of the current policy is the normalization of different forms of abus.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Working Party should encourage a tolerance culture.
The reality is that we are no longer this great community and that the parties are restricted through the movements of defiance and changes of the election rules.
They gave me a lot of advice these two last years: Down the eyes, don't express my ideas so strong, and everything would be well.
But it's not to do so as I do the policy.
I met the Working Party for 32 years ago as a choice, because the negligency of the Government of Thatcher had caused my class room. Since then, I had been sent to work for better public services for those who need the most needed, as well as as local counsel or Minister of the Government.
I have never hid my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and by my differences with the current responsibilities of the Partie.
All I would like to say to those who have defended the Friday move is that the country will go to a Brexit that will affect families, enterprises and public services. I think it's not really the time to lose time and energy in discussing my loyalty to the leader of the party.
My only message is not for Nottingham Moment, it is for my electors that they are workists or not: I am honourable to serve you and I promise you that no threat of retreat or oportsm will stop me to act for the causes I defense, which are your interests to all.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose : Air remains invainable
Two later tests may have missed the final result, but there is no doubt: Ayr would meet this triomphe after the intense day of the Rugby Ecose Championate in XV.
The team is then occupied up the top of the classing and becomes the only invasion team of the campionate.
At the end, it is the highest of their defence and the way they have given the opportunities to open the score. Peter Murchie trainer can welcome this match.
"To now, we have been tested, but we are invained, then I have to be happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, welcomed Ayr: “They were more efficient than we and have entered the opportunities. ”
The test of Grant Anderson, on the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, sent Ayr in a good position, but a yellow carton for the ecosis Rory Hughes, free for the match by Warrios, allowed Melrose to talk to the numbers. Jason Baggot was made by an untransformed test.
Climo aggressed the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just at half time. He marked and transformed a test only to mount the score to 17-5 for Ayr to the break.
Melrose started the second half-time and the test of Patrick Anderson, transformed by Baggot, reduced the escape to five points.
He followed a long attention because of a serious worm of Ruarý Knott, who left the land on a citizen. At the time he repeated, Ayr retraced the faces with a test of Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Captain of Ayr, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his chance with an untransformed test of Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team was back in his hands and when Struun Hutchinson received a yellow carton to tackle Climo while he had no ballon, since the penalty key, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's moul, who was progressing.
Climo transformed the test, like almost every time since the repeating, after Kyle Rowe gathered the kick box of David Armstrong and sent the aileer Gregor Henry away for the fifth test of the home team.

Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a carrier in the restaurant. The comité was named director of a restaurant company under licence.
The 56-year-old man Jack Jarvis in the celebration show of the BBC, who wrote and co-animated with his long-date partner on the scene, Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the ninth series comes will be the end of the show and Kiernan seems to be prepared for the next Craiglang.

“The sea is to us”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
Seasons are patrols in a blind ship in the general room of the Naval La Paz.
Public buildings build a blue train like the ocean.
From the Titicaca lake in Amazonia, the ship bases show the following motive: "The sea returns from the right.
The receiving is a debt."
Over the entire Bolivia, the memory of a cost lost by the beneficial of Chili in a conflict of resources in the 19th century is still well present. As the desire to ship on the Pacific Ocean, once more.
These hopes were not so palpable since several decades, but the Bolivia expects a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be made on 1 October after five years of release.
“ Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unit and seriousness, and waits well to hear a positive result, ” explains Roberto Calzadilla, bolivia diplomate.
Many Bolivia will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country, hopeing that the Court of La Haye is pronounced for the Bolivia request. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sport negotiations, Chili should be negotiated with the agreement of a sovereign pass to the Ocean to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the Indian Carismatic President of the Bolivia (which faces a controversy fight for the next year of the election) is also much to say about the decision that will be done tomorrow.
"We are so near to be able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said finally.
But some analyticals think that there are little chances that the Court pronounce for Chili, and how little things would change, even in the case of positive decision.
The United Nations instance based on the Netherlands does not have the power to agree a chile territorie, and has stated that it would not determine the results of the events of speaking.
The fact that the International Court makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “not was complied,” explains peace Zarate, a chili expert on international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may even have brought him prejudice.
“The problem of access to the sea has been declined by the current bolivia administration,” said Zarate.
The wonderful heritage of Morales knowed all the good Chile’s will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chili will continue to switch, but after that, it will be very complicated to organize parliaments.
The last switch of campaigns between two countries was in 1962.
The ancient President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, who represents the Bolivia in the Haye, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court was usually quickly quick.
Monday will bring to Bolivia "a extraordinary opportunity to start a new year of relationship with Chili" and a chance to “the end of 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also stated that Morales - who remains in this day one of the most popular Presidents in Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political beach.
“The Bolivia will never leave its right to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court's decision is a chance to see that we must disagree from the past.”
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will be located only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Minister of Foreign Affairs in North Korea, stated that his country would not depart from its nuclear weapons until he would not trust in Washington.
The United Nations General Assembly expressed the Sabbath.

It was expressed at the time the Secretary-General of the United States of Mike Pompeo seems to restart a nuclear diplomacy in the over three months after the Singapour summit with Kim Jong One, current leader from North Korea.
It states that it is "chimical" to think that the maintenance of the sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a statement that will end in Korea's war will increase the north.
Washington is urgent to accept the statement in the absence of significant disarmament measures from Pyongyang's part.
Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summary.
But the serious Pyongyang on the renewing of an assessment that the country is as the only guarantee of its safety is discussed.

John Edward: language competences are essential to the world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a book of school excellence. This tendance continued in 2018 with new reviews strengthened by a collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other Community activities.
With more than 30 000 students in the whole school, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to offer the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students to higher education, the carrier they have chosen and at their place as citizens of the world.
As the education sector in order to conceive and establish a high-measure education programme, we convince that contemporary languages remain popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, you speak to his heart. ”
This reminds us that we cannot support English to create relations and establish a trust link with other countries.
If it looks at the extent results in the analysis this year, languages are higher than the classation, with the most important rate of success in independent schools.
In total, 68% of the students who studied foreign languages have obtained the highest note, A.
The data collected at the 74 members of the SCIS schools show that 72% of the students have received the highest note, A, in mandarin, as well as 72% of the highest students studied by Germany, 69% of high schools who have studied French and 63% of schools who have studied Spanish.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential competences for children and young people in the future.
Then, languages as materials are organized as sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and other schools.
A British Commission for the employment and competences achieved in 2014 shows that between the difficulties that employees have occurred to recruit candidates, 17 % are linked to insufficient language competences.
Therefore, language competences are more and more vital to prepare young people to their future carriers.
With more work offers needing languages, these competences are essential in our globalised world.
It doesn't matter how it is, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real benefit in the future through this sustainable competence.
Communicating directly with strangers will automatically place the multilinguish person before its competitors.
According to a YouTube sondage in 2013 at 4000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% of them would not dominate enough foreign languages to have a conversation. The French was the only language speaking by a percentage of two numbers (15%).
That is why investment in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking many languages, in particular the economies of the merchants, children will benefit from the best chances of finding a free employment.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on classical languages, while others will teach important languages for the United Kingdom in the 2020 perspective, including the mandatory or the Japanese.
As the preferences of your child, many languages will be accessible in independent schools, with a specialist in the area.
Independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary competences for their success, less important as their future reserves.
It is clear that in a global trade environment, languages remain a capital importance for the future of the country, which must reflect in education.
The modern languages should be considered as “international communication competences”.
Independent schools will continue to propose this choice, this variety, and this excellence to the school youth.
We need to do it well.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools

Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team is ready to fight to keep waiting for the approach of simple lunch
After three simples, the Saturday Foods could be well represented what was missing in this Ryder Cup.
The balance movement of the island is a sportive concept invented by all parts, but the players believe honestly, and more than ever in turns such as this.
So where would they sit in the field now?
"They were driving with six points forward and now four, so that's why we give us a bit of aile," said Jordan Spieth, while he was left for the day.
Europe has the advancement, well hearing, with four points of progress and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a little wind in the skin and have all reasons to be encouraged, in particular by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all the day and may be able to get each three points on four.
Spieth showed very effectively the tee to green and gave the example.
The energy joy crises were intensified in the measure that his game was progressed. A crucial puzzle allowed him to equalize the fourth part when Thomas and him were led two down after two branches.
His damn shit, through which they brought the match to the 15th trip, excited a similar cry, from those who say that he always believes the American team.
“ It must really be determined and focused on his game, ” says Spieth.
It's all that he remains to each of these players now.
18 branches to start.
The only players that have marked more points than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the story of the Ryder Cup.
The weirdest loved European father brought four matches to four and does not have the right to the mistake.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones to not realize a week-end bogey after-midnight, but they also escaped the Sunday morning, Friday after-midnight and at the last nine feasts of the morning.
This series, how their energy seems to circulate between them and the people to release them as players to fight tomorrow, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari, where the powerful European victory when the sun sleeps on the National Golf.
In preference, both in the same time in different branches.
But speak of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Sipson rapidly batted Sergio Garcia, the heroes of the morning, while he made a team with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two duplicates on the nine first couples sent Spain and Sweden into a wood that they never could resort.
On the other hand, nobody's here to help you.
Foodballs and fuels are so fascinating to observe closely because of interactions between the couples, the advice they give and those they don't give, and in the way a strategy can cut into an eye clinic.
Europe has played better in team until now and has taken a significant progress during the last day, but this foursoms session also proved that the Americans had the strength of fighting, which some should, in particular in the country.
Europe takes 10-6 at the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a solid benefit in the last day of Ryder Cup after he had submitted it 10-6 on the United States in footballs and satellites.
The two inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari brought the charge with two victories on a Tiger Woods in depression, which allowed them to mark four points until now.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn made a different difference in 3-1 in the morning in the fireballs, faced a disordered American team.
The United States have shown a greater resistence in the forests and have reached two victories, but they have not succeeded to resume the escape.
Jim Furyk's men must immediately decrease eight points on 12 weeks in simple to keep the tropees.
Fleetwood is the first European recrute to discover four points of affliction, while Molinari and him, named Molliwood after a weekend missing, are only the second couple of the history of Ryder Cup to get four points at their first four matches.
After they shot Woods and Patrick Reed in footballs, they struck on the board the park composed by the American starter Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already hit by a 5 and a 4 more category.
Woods, who was trained during the two parts of the Sabbath, had lightened at some time, but then he lost 19 of his 29 matches in fireballs and fires, and seven feeds.
Justin Rose, well relaxed for the fuelballs of the morning, made a team with Henrik Stenson in the bottles, bringing victory 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopka, respectively numbers one and three in the world class.
Europe has not been exposed in the tour that was discovered in the South-Occident of Paris, under a fresh but disappointed time.
The triples win Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas have established the reference for the Americans marking two weekends.
They brought a good victory to 2-1 against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the footballs and struck Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the bottles, those who lost the first two branches.
Twice in the history of Ryder Cup, a team received a scart of four simple points, although the Furyk team, who had the corner, was not more than to make any match to keep his tropees.
After they were seconds for two days, however, they couldn't be able to turn from a dinner attack.
The North Korea states that the disarmament can't be unilaterally untrusted.
Saturday, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs stated the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions enhanced its unfaithfulness in respect of the United States and that it would be impossible for its country to renew their nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
In the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that the North Korea had adopted the last year of the “important measures of good will” such as the end of nuclear and missile tests, the latest of nuclear tests and its commitment to not prolifer the nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies
"But we see no corresponding answer from the United States," he reported
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear our national security and, in such circumstances, is excluded that we are the first to disarma unilaterally."
Returning the well known reproaches of the North Korea on the opposition of Washington to an approach “by steps” of the denuclearization in which the North Korea would be rewarded if it had progressively taken measures, its statement was important in that it does not reject the idea of a unique denuclearisation such as Pyongyang had done it through the past.
Ri refered to a common statement of Kim Jong One and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore during the first summary between an American president in exercise and a North Korean leader, when Kim was committed to work for a “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised to ensure the security of the North Korea.
The North Korea seeks to finish officially in Corea (1950-1953), but the United States said that Pyongyang should first reject its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused the requests to apply severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States encourages the North Korea to process first to denuclearization and accent pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their objectives in competitive way, even against "the war's end declaration".
“ Those who think that these sanctions can do us to work don’t know us.
The problem is that the maintenance of sanctions increases our mistakes. ”
Ri has not made a comment on the second summary between Kim and Trump in exercise before the United Nations by the American Leader for the week later.
The Minister also sublined three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Leader Moon Jae-in during the past five months and added: “If the part concerned by the denuclearisation issue was the South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not be found in such impasses.”
However, the sound of Ri's talk was rarely different from the last year, when he had stated before the General Assembly of the United Nations that he was inevitable to point the North Korean Missiles on the North America Territory after the "maleffic" President Trump qualified Kim of 'misile' in his own mission.
Trump, who had threatened the last year before the United Nations to “destruction completely” the North Korea, did not taste an ellogs this year on the courage with which Kim applied measures for a disarmament, but added that he remained still much to do and that sanctions would not be raised until the North Korea would not be disarmed.
Mercredi, Trump stated that no time was fixed. "This may take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia support that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, the Secretary-General of America, Mike Pompeo, declared the last Jeudi to the United Nations Security Council that: "The application of the Security Council sanctions must be closely and systematically maintained until the total, definitive and checked denunciation."
The Security Council strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to enhance the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri in march of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would come again to Pyongyang the next month to prepare a second summary.
This year, Pompeo has already become three times in North Korea, but his last journey was a little disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang, confirming that progress had been accomplished, but in the following hours, the North Korea denied his “the methods of gangster. ”
At a meeting with Moon this month, the North Korea tried to deal with a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States had taken “equivalent measures”.
According to the President of South Korea, Kim claims the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard: students take rest courses
This year, Harvard University has set a new course that allows all students of the first cycle to sleep more and fight the growing machine tendency that is to study in the consumption of the coffee all night.
A teacher noted that most of the students of the best university of the world can't take care of them
This course, proposed by Charles Czeisler, doctor of the dream at the Harvard Medical School and specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of the United States.
It was after a conference on the effects of dream privacy on the learning that the idea came to him.
At the end, a student approached me and said, "Why did we just tell me this last year?"
She said that no one had never spoken to her about the dream's importance, what was surprised to me," he trusted the The Telegraph.
Depending for the first time this year, this course explains students the need to adopt good dream habits to improve their school and physical performances, as well as their welfare in general.
Paul Barreira, psychiatric teacher in Harvard Medical School and Director General of Health Services of University, stated that the university had decided to introduce the course after he had stated that students had suffered a serious dream during the week.
The course time is in various interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a bedroom containing different objects (coffee, ride, baskets, books...) on which students click to know the effects of the coffee and light, and the impact of the dream on their physical prestations and the importance of integrating a routine before sleeping.
In another section, participants learn how long-term dream missing can increase the risks of heart attack, AVC, depression and cancer.
A map of the campaign containing interactive icons then invites the participants to consider their daily routine.
“ We know that this will not immediately change the conduct of students.
However, according to us, they have the right to know these information - in the same way you have the right to know the effects of the tobacco on health, ” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of honour of “transmit a white night ” is always existing, and it adds that modern technologies and pressure without growing pressure exercised on students makes a big problem in dream.
The fact that he had a sufficient dream and good quality should be the "the secret weapons" of students to fight stretch, excessiveness and injury, he has said - even to disappear the weakness, because the failure of dreams has the brain in inition mode, which makes them permanently attached.
Raymond So, a californian student in chemical and physical biologist of 19 years, helped Professor Czeisler to conceal this course after he was one of his students last year, during his first year in Harvard.
He told him that this course had opened his eyes, and he struck it to insert it to be proposed to all the campus.
It hopes that the next step will be proposed to all students of the third cycle to follow a similar study program before the reputed establishment.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to provide an alarm as well for the time of sleep as for the reveal, and to be aware of the vulnerable effects of the “Blue light” issued by the electronic screens and the LED light, which can suffer their circumdain rithm and endurance difficulties.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The purpose of Menga makes the men of Gerrard
The Rangers got a new hard step outside, the attack of Dolly Menga sent the disarmament team from Steven Gerrard to Livingston to a default of 1-0.
The Ibrox team hoped to record his first victory moved from his triomphant 4-1 in February to St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team infected her second default in Gerrard in 18 matches as a trainer, leaving his team to the deriver, eight points behind the Hearts, men of Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the half-time and the Rangers team, at a short inspiration, didn't succeed to equalize.
While the Rangers then shoot at the sixth place, Livingston is in the third position, just behind Hibernian on the difference of targets.
And other difficulties could be feeling for Rangers, the armor Calum Spence, who had to be shocked for a wound at the head on the steel of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard did eight changes in the team, which balayed Ayr in half the Coupe Betfred.
Holt, about him, chose the same Livi 11 who took a point to Hearts last week and would have been pleased to see that his well-introdued team was stealing his adversary at every tour.
The Rangers may have dominated the inheritance of the ballon, but Livingston has done more.
They should have marked in two minutes when the first shot of Menga sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor, but the middle of the land left his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then shoot a powerful shoot in the direction of Captain Craig Halckett, but his coacher Alan Lithgow could just get the second pool.
The Rangers had successful to take the control, but it seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was sure that he had to benefit from a penalty after the frank couple when Steven Lawless and he entered in collision but the army Steven Thomson had disappeared the requests of Colombia.
The Rangers only benefited from two shoes in the first period, but the old guard of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was in a worried wounded by Lassana Coulibaly and a battle of Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi on the 34th minute has been inscripted against the course of the game, no one can take care of them from their work.
A new time, the Rangers missed the face of Jacobs' feet arrested.
Scott Arfield doesn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ballon to Scott Robinson, who kept his blood-free to choose Menga for a single end.
Gerrard reacted at the same time by replaceing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and the switch has well failed to have an immediate impact when the aircraft was presented before Morelos, but the Impressor Kelly was emphasized to block.
Livingston continued to put the visitors to play exactly the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett with long ballets on long balles.
Holt's team could take the advance in the last moment, but McGregor was well broken to repeat Jacobs before Lithgow goes near the goal.
The Replacer of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, revoked a penalty once he was taken with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Germany: The Geiger accounting income
And now, one page of our German 'Sonday Morning': On September 30, 1882, there are 136 years ago, and LE COMPTEUR TOURNE... was born the future physicist John Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method that allows to detect and measure the radio activity; an invention that later has been given to be born to the device known as Geiger account.
The Scientific Pilar since, the Geiger account also became fundamental in the pop culture, as you can see it in the film "Bells of Coronado" of 1950, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unprobable scientists:
A man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger account, we use it to search radioactive minerals, such as urinum.
With these auditors, you can really hear the effects of atoms left in the minerals by radio activity.’
Evans: “Speak so, it's sure it's saving, there! ”
“ Hans ” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that takes his name remaining.
A new vaccin against the cancer allows the immune system to "decline" cancer cells
A new vaccin against the cancer allows the immune system to "decline" cancer cells and kill them
In the framework of treatment, the vaccin indicates the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technical is to extract immunitary cells from a patient and to edit them in laboratory
They can then "deceive" a protein that is common to many cancers, and then are reinjected
An experimental vaccin shows income results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccin, which is to learn to the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer lost for over 18 months.
The method is to extract immunitary cells from a patient and to modify them in laboratory, so that they can decline the HER2 protein, common with many cancers, and finally reinject them.

Maxine Waters believes that one of the GOP employees had developed data on the senators, and denounces the “sufficient lies” and“theories of the complot”.
Samedi, the American Republican Maxine Waters declared the allégations that a member of his team would have published personal information on three Republic Senators on the Wikipédia pages offered to legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by experts and web sites “right extreme”.
“ Liars, liars, and yet false famines ” replied Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It seems that the information that the information was developed included the addresses and phone numbers of American senators. Lindsey Graham, South Caroline, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information has been made online by an unknown in Capitol Hill during the Senat meeting on sexual attacks against the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The escape was a few days after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, store sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have indicated that the IP address identifiing the source of messages was associated with the Waters Office and developed the information of a member of the Waters personnel.
According to Waters, “the unbased allégation is completely false and a absolute lie. ”
“The member of my team, including identity, personal information and security, has been compromised because of these fraud and false allégations, is not responsible for the escape of these information."
“ This false allégation is completely false and a true lie. ”
The Waters' statement was quickly highlighted online critics, including the part of Ari Fleicher, the ancient pressure of the House-Blanche.
"This deed is a wrath," he wrote.
"This indicates that it does not have the temperature necessary to be member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something she didn't do, she should not be in anger.
She doesn't have to be provoked.
She must not be rejected by reason of the reasons of the accuser.
She must be quiet and serious. ”
Fleicher seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the critics of the Democratic Democratics in respect of the judge Kavanaugh, accused to be too angry in the audience of judiction.
Omar Navarro, a republican candidate at Waters' seat in the middle elections, also made part of his opinions on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's great," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters indicated that his office had warned “the authorities and services carried out of the implementation of the relevant laws” about these fraud absences.

Johnny English is still smoking. Rowan Atkinson's parodie, subdued spion
Then it became a tradition to search for Brexit's portent in all new British films, and it seems to be applied to this review of Johnny English action committee, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned on the surface in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
The ironic autostarier on the issue of the evidence of our insignificance will be the new chance of exporting our country?
In all cases, the incompetent Johnny English, the scarkilled eyes and the face in caoutchouc, saw his licence renewed for the second time in a confusion context - this name indicating before it is a great comic creation designed for a non-Anglophone public cinefill.
Of course, it is the stupid secret agent who, although his doubtful trials of glamorous charmer, has a little Clouseau, a suspect of Mr. Bean, and a good dose of the type that runs a small note in The Fire Chariots during the opening of the Olympics games 2012 in London.
In the original, it also inspires the traveller and the international mystery man that Atkinson played again in the TV publicities Barclaycard, then forgot, and left the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English is one or two sympatic moments.
I loved Johnny English in training to approach a helicopter when he brought a medium army and that the rotor's pals were breathely smoking against his box.
Atkinson's talent for the physical comité is valuable, although the humor is most insufficient and weirdly overflowed, in particular when the licences 's serious' such as 007 and the impossible Mission compose themselves in all confidence with the comité.
The humor seems more orientated to children than to adults and, for me, the farmers of Johnny English are less creative and less targeted than the film games of Atkinson in Bean's personality.
The prevention for the present is that the Great Britain has severe problems.
A computer pirate has infiltred the super-secret web network of British spons, devoting the identity of all the British agents on the ground, in the large department of the service agents - a lower role of low-related role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the guest that makes the vaccin for a first minister who is a pumping person at the border of the crisis and is already suffering of a political immunity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this almost Teresa-May, but there is no big-chose to put up under the dent in the scenario.
His counselors informed him that each active spion which was compromised should make someone out of his retraite.
This means that Johnny English himself, which is now employed in a kid as a teacher of school, but who gives secretly lessons on the way to become secret agent: some beautiful fats here, because English proposes an academy of spionage way Rock Academy.
English is returned to Whitehall for a meeting of urgent information and finds Bough, his old Haleine partner, again campaign by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, raised to a submarine commander, a amusing role in which Vicki Pepperdin is a little played.
So, Batman and Robin, who create great challenges to the Secret Services of His Majesty, reached the action and met Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman of Ophelia Bulletova.
At a time, the first Ministry was in danger under the billionary charismatic undertaking, which was able to resolve the informatic problems of the Great Britain: the left Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their oxyse of farmers: under the smoking of the servers, they put fire to a blowing French restaurant; they create a chaos favouring on the luxury willier of Volta; and English declares a real anarchie when he trys, with a virtual reality box, to familiarize himself with the house of Volta.
All arrests are safe for this last sequence, but although everything, there is no bad thing for children in all this.
A movie was most moderate.
I couldn't stop thinking, as for the other films of Johnny English: Can it not offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really will be worth its talent?

However, this aspiration is not for the moment supported by the Working Party in its together.
A port-word of the Working Party stated: "A week of four days is not a policy of the Partie and is not considered by this."

I called him after that, when these allégations were formulated, and I asked him, "Do you do that?"
He was resolved, determined, without equivocation. ”
However, the vote of Graham seems gravity in the stone.
"I took my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and he would have a explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has taken it categoryally," added Graham, with a lot to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people whose name was not able to check it.
It's an old case of 36 years.
I don't know anything again that changes."

The American President Donald Trump announced the supply paid by China Daily in the Moines Register - the most sold journal in Iowa – after he had accused China to try to impress himself in the American parliamentary elections of 6 November, an accusation that China refuses.
By accusing Pekin to immiss the American elections, Trump marked what the American responsibles told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing campaign carried out by Washington to put the pressure on China.
While it is current for foreign governments to place publicities to promote trade, Pekin and Washington are currently parallel in a growing trade war which has led them to apply reciproc taries to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, the tariff measures in China were intended to destroy the exporters of States such as Iowa who supported the Republic Party of Trump, said Chinese and American experts.

Analysts warn that the republicans involve the electronics in the approach of the Middle-Mitting elections due to Kavanaugh debuilding
While many high-range republicans defender Brett Kavanaugh, named to the Supreme Court in a context of sexual agression allégations, analyzes warned that a negative reaction, particularly in women could overcome during the next mid-management elections.

In a article published on 29 September in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell University of Syracuse, stated that we can't return back.
Reeher added that he was supposed that the efforts of the last minute developed by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) for a FBI investigation are enough to calm the wrath of electors.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, the main and national advice of the Progressist Group MoveOn, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said on 28 September last, according to the Washington Journal.

“The enthusiasm and democratic motivation will be decreased,” said Stu Rothenberg, an unpartial political analysis.
"The people believe that it's already high, it's true.
But this may be more higher, particularly in the branches and in the young electors of 18 to 29 years, who, even if they don't love the President, often do not vote. ”
Even before the public deposit of Ford explaining in detail sexual agression allégations against the name of the Supreme Court, the analyzers believed that the reaction would be risked to be alive if the republicans had made the confirmation.

Ford testified the last week before the Senat Court of Justice that she had been attacked by Kavanaugh while he was in the age of 17.
Ramirez suggests that when they were studying in Yale in the 1980s, the candidate to the Supreme Court would show him his genital parties during a feast.
The World Wide Web Inventor reviews to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web Inventor, launchs a new business that seeks to review with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technological leadership, Inrupt, is a society who takes part of the free platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are safe and the authorised persons to access such or such information.
In a exclusive interview offered to Fast Company, Berners-Lee declared pleasantly that Inrupt was “good to dominate the world. ”
"We have to do this now," he said about the launch.
"It's a story moment."
Application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store" or DPL.
This can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, musical library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The particularity of the online data store is that it is entirely the user to decide who can access the type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility through data”.
According to the PDG of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company brings resources, processes and competences to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is currently composed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM safe platform, some developers working on the project and a voluntary coder community.
At this week, technological developers of the whole world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team and he's not yet discussed with Facebook and Google to know whether it's necessary or not to operate a complete change where all their business models are completely packed in a moment.
“ We don't ask them the permission. ”
In a sabate article on Media, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission [d'Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems in order to protect integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, in Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee was transformed on the World Wide Web Consortium.
During the last months, Berners-Lee was a influenced voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although he started Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimist about this new time of the web," added Berners-Lee.

With regard to transmission, the principal Vice-President of Marketing and Communications in Bellator, Dave Schwartz, stated that “the Government Regulation requires only six hours of the morning, this content was not adapted, then they had to cut into children's emissions.”
"Peppa the pig", yes.
Scott Coker, President of the Bellator company, stated that they were going to work on their programming to include British telespectors in the future.
“ I think when I think of the refrigeration, I think we probably can find a solution, ” says Coker.
“But it's six hours of the morning, and we can't find a solution before the Sunday or the morning.
But we work there.
Trust me, when the program was shot, there were many messages in both senses and they were not all friends.
We tried to repair, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a governmental question.
I can assure you that this will not happen next time.
We will be limited to five fights instead of six - as we usually do it - and we have tried to give more for the fans and we have all hunted.
It's a regretable situation."

A Mickelson out of the bank of the Ryder Cup samedi
The American Phil Mickelson will realize a record this lunch by playing his 47th match of the Ryder Cup, but it should be reduced to avoid that it's a funny step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelve-time record, was cut off by Captain Jim Furyk of Fowballs and Saturday Fowballs.
Instead of being in the heart of the action, as it has been so often for the United States, the fifth great campion shared his day between the role of support and the peoping of his game to stand in order to meditate with its mistakes.
He has never been the biggest of the mentors, even at the top of his carrier. In 48 years, he is not the most adapted for the difficult National Golf, where the long round punishs systematically the cut off.
And as if the parker wasn't satisfied in himself, Mickelson, on the ninth match, against Francesco Molinari, the British Open winter, who made this week with Tommy Fleetwood to bring their four matches.
If the Americans, at the beginning of 12 matches, take a good department, the match of Mickelson could be absolutely critical.
Furyk expressed his trust in his man, but he couldn't say a big-hoss others.
"He completely understood the role he had to play today, he gave me a cup in the dog, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
“ He has great confidence in him.
It's a legitimate campion and he added so many things to these teams by the past, as well as this week.
I probably didn't see him play two matches.
I had more proposed, but it's like that happened, and it's like that we should be proceeding.
He wants to be there, like all the others."
Wednesday, Mickelson will fight the record of Nick Faldo's record of the greatest meetings of the Ryder Cup discussed.
This could mark the end of a carrier to Ryder Cup that has never been achieved by the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defects and seven demits, although Furyk stated that his presence has brought specific elements to the team.
He's drunk, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to marry people, and it's a wonderful type to have in the team's room," he explained.
“ I think the youngest players had pleasure to meet him this week, what was fun to see.
He makes more than to play. ”
The Captain of the European election Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could immediately disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows by experience that an unnegliggable progress could easily be transformed in penalty parks before the simple day of Ryder Cup.
The Danish declared his first match in Valderrama in 1997, where a team whose captain was seven Ballesteros had five front points on the Americans, but finally hissed the classing with the less possible cut on the row of arrival, in the port 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop remember that we had a wide progress in Valderrama; we had a great progress in Brooklyn, where we failed, and in Valderrama, where we win, but righteousness," said Bjorn, after observing the Class of 2018 to bring the victory 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to the National Golf to be 10-6.
The story will prove us, to me and to all the members of this team, that it's not the end.
Go back tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything you need.
It's not finished before having the points on the table.
We have a goal, to try to bring this tropeee, and it is that we must stay concentrated.
I always told me to concentrate on the 12 players of our camp, but we are very known about what happens from the other side - these are the best players of the world. ”
Bjorn added: "I'd never advanced on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another couple of manches.
Tomorrow, these are the individual performances that will be presented, and it will be all otherwise.
It's amazing to be with a coquery when things are good, but when you're in solitary, you're at the test of your full capacity as golfeur.
This is the message to go to players, it's to shoot the best of you tomorrow.
When we leave his partner behind himself, he must go to the best of himself, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, his homologic Jim Furyk will seek to do so that its players get better results individually than as cooking, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have received three points on four.
Furyk himself recognized the two extremists of these reviews of the last day, after having been part of the gaining team in Brooklyn before he lost the Miracle of Medinaah, where Europe has gathered the victory.
“I remember each word, ” he explained in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, had done to raise his players last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick department as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw it in Mednah.
This dynamic, when she goes into a sense, makes a lot of pressure on the environment.
We have established our training in consecution and set up the guys as we think we should do it, we are trying to make the magic tomorrow. ”
Thomas has seen the task to act against the attack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first class, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the class.
“I have been with this group of guys in this order because I think that it covers all the parkers,” said Bjorn on his simple choices.
The new war ship of Germany still reported
According to the local media, the new frequency of the German Sea should be served in 2014 to replace old war boats from the frozen war, but this will not be served at least the next year because of defective systems and exponential expenditures.
According to the The Times, which quotes a military port, the service of Rheinland-Pfalz, the amiral ship of all new frequencies of Bade-Wurtemberg, was reported on the first September 2019.
The ship had to integrate the Marine in 2014, but the worst problems occurred after the delivery were compromised the destination of this environmental project.
The four ships of the Bade-Wurtemberg class that the Marine had commanded in 2007 will be replaced by the old frequency of the Brüme class.
It is sure that they will be taken from a powerful canon, a game of anti-aerian and antinavire missiles, and of some furtive technology, such as a radiar, infrastructure and acoustic signature.
Other important functionalities include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to develop the most recent frequency for a period that can get two years outside attack ports.
According to The Times, however, the ingressive retards mean that the pre-guards of war - which should allow Germany to project its power out-mer - will be already obsolete when they are set in service.
Last year, F125's maudite fregate made big tits when Germany was officially refused to set the ship in service and sent it to the ship of Blohm & Voss, Hamburg.
It was the first time the marine returned a ship to a shipbuilder after her delivery.
The reasons for this return were unknown, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and material failures” that made the unusual war ship in case of deployment in battle mission.
The deficits of software were particularly important because the Bade-Wurtemberg ships will be operated by a composed equipment of about 120 seasons, which correspond to half of the old frequency equipment of Bremen class.
Furthermore, it seems that the ship is considered significantly overloaded, which reduces its reward and reduces the capacity of the sea to bring future improvements.
It is estimated that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tonnes is twice greater than the similar class ships used by Germany during the Second World War.
Besides the disagreements of the computer system, the price of the project in its together - including the training of the equipment - also becomes a problem.
It is said that he has achieved the astronomical sum of 3,1 billion euros (3,6 billion dollars), against 2,2 billion away.
Problems related to new frequencies are particularly important to the light of recent warnings according to which Germany's ship force reduces.
Hans-Peter Bartels, captain of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recognized this year that Marine is actually “for short ships in order to develop.”
The responsibility stated that the situation had produced a snow ball effect with time, because old ships were discovered but no replacement ship was designed.
He agreed that no part of the Bade-Wurtemberg class could be joined to the Marine.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of chauss-souris
New researchs conducted in an area of highland highlands are looking forward to demonstrate how sourishes use landing in their food search.
It is hoped that the observations will lead a new light on the conduct of these single volunteers and guide the future conservation activities.
The study of researchers of National Trust for Scotland will follow common and sopranos pistols, as well as brunish-souris chauss and Daubenton in the garden of Inverewe, Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed on key locations around the property to follow the activities of the shoes throughout the saison.
The NHS personal and beneficiary will also make mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional analysis of its sound will be allowed to determine the frequency of the crises of smoking and the activities of various species.
A card and a report on the residence will be established to draw a detailed table of their behavior at the range of the territory.
Rob Dewar, in maintenance of the nature for the NTS, hopes that results will reflect the most important areas of the residence for shoes and how these are used by each of these species.
This information allows you to determine the benefits of livestock management works such as the creation of prayers and the best way to maintain forests for the shoes and other connected species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the populations of soil-souris have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the passengers and loss their homes.
Olympics and lighting can also represent a risk, as well as murdered papers and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as the attacks of company chats.
The shirt-shirts are not really awful.
However, when they were given their chase nightwhile habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it is to capture projects.
They use a sophistic ecolocalisation technology to repeat insects and obstacles on their flight island.
Responsable to protect more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares in the country, the NTS takes very serious chairs.
There is ten formed experts, which are regularly fulfilled by sounds, inspections on the shore and sometimes savings.
In addition, the organization has established the first and only reserve of Scosse-souris chauves on the site of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which opens eight of the ten species of shoes of Ecosse.
David Thompson, manager of the area, states that the site is the ideal territory for them.
“ Here, in Threave, we have a ideal place for the shoes,” he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees and all the good inhabitants.
But it remains still much to learn about the shoes, although the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand better what the shoes need to continue."
It underlines the importance of checking the presence of shoes-souris before processing the maintenance of properties, because by destroying without wanting a single maternity, the death of 400 women and small women can be caused by the loss of all local population.
The shoes are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to delay them, or to destroy their shoes.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Bat Conservation Trust ecosis responsible, encouraged the public to bring his help.
She said: "We have a lot of learning about our shoes and about many of our species, we don't know what happens in their populations for now."
Ronaldo refuses violence accusations while his lawyers are ready to continue in justice a German magazine
Cristian Ronaldo qualified violation accusations against him of “false information ” and said that people want to be known by using his name.
His lawyers are approved to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published allgements.
The attacker of Portugal and the Juvento was accused to violate a American name of Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
Then he would give him $375,000 to keep silence on this accident, indicated the last Friday Der Spiegel.
In addressing its 142 million fans in a directly published video on Instagram, a few hours after the divorce of allogations, Ronaldo, 33 years, qualified these information about “false information”.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, it's a false information," said to the camera the fifth louréat of the Ballon of Or.
“ They want to make a pub using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be celebrated by saying my name, but it's part of the work.
I'm a happy man and all right," added the player with a dream.
According to Reuters, the lawyers of Ronaldo are approved to continue to Der Spiegel on these allégations, which have qualified “inadmissible denunciation of suspitions in the private life area”.
The lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would ask a reparation in the title of the “moral dommages of a proportional amount to the gravity of infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the rights of the person of these last years”.
The presumed accident would have been in June 2009 in a post of the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night box, Ronaldo and Mayorga appeared to be returned to the room of the player, where an anal violation would happen, according to documents listed to the Court of Clark, in Nevada.
Mayorga states that Ronaldo was a genius after the present accident and surveyed to be a "boy good" at "99%" but he didn't know what happened with the remaining "1%".
The documents suggest that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that they were consensus.
Mayorga also stated that the police had been made and that photos of her wounds were taken in a hospital, but that she later had accepted a regulation to the friendly because she felt “terrorized by reprehensives” and feared“ to arise a public humility. ”
This 34-year woman states that she now seeks to cancel this Regulation, because she remains traumaticed by the proposed accident.
Ronaldo was on the point of joining the Real Madrid when Manchester United was left at the time of this presumed agression, and this was, he joined the Italian Gentle Juve in a contract of 100 million euros.
Breach: The United Kingdom would 'report forever' the department of car constructors.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State of Communities, the United Kingdom would 't ever regret it' if she would lose its world-wide leadership after Brexit.
He added that he was “be careful ” that Toyota UK stated to the BBC that she would immediately stop the production in her use of Burnatton, near Derby, if the Great Britain would have gone from the EU without a agreement.
"We need a agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese builder indicated that the impact of retards at the border in the event of a Brexit without agreement could cost employment.
Burnaston's use - which produces Auris and Avensis of Toyota - has built about 150 000 cars last year, which have been exported to the other European Union countries.
“I consider that if the Great Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, the production will stop in our use," said Marvin Cooke, Director of Toyota to Burnatton.
Other British vehicles, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear to leave the EU without agreement on the operation of the transfrontal trade.
For example, BMW indicates that she will close her use in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concerns are concerned that car rental constructors quality risks for the approval chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is explored in "tendue flux", the parts are achieved every 37 minutes of the United Kingdom and the EU providers for vehicles manufactured on command.
If on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, it may have perturbations to the border which, according to the industry, could be able to travel retards and penalties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain more investment than one day at its use of Derbyshire, and the company said, and then the production would be stopped.
According to Clark, the Chequers of Theresa May plan regarding future relations with the EU is “exactly calibrated to escape these controls to the border”.
"We need a agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will, as I said, is not only to benefit the current success, but also to enter this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4's Today Emission.
"The evidence, not only of Toyota, but of other constructors, is that we must be absolutely enabled to maintain what has been revealed in a great joint of approval chains."
If Toyota was not able to determine how long the production would be stopped, yet she warned that to longer, the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the use and would end up by costs of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the United syndicat coordinator, who works since 24 years in Burnston, said that his members were more worried: “It is my experience, when these works are lost, they never return. ”
A government's port-word stated: "We have proposed a specific and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The House-Blanche announces that the meeting of Trump and Rosenstein could still be retared
According to the announcement, the White House, the meeting, which presents important interests, between Donald Trump and general Rod Rosenstein could be “repeated for a week, ” while the fight for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continued.
Rosenstein surveys the work of Robert Mueller, the special advice to investigate Russian inheritance in the elections, links between Trump and Russia and the potential income to the justice exercised by the President.
The question to know whether Trump will return or not the adjoined general prosecutor, and then it will make a risk of the independence of Mueller, eating the runners in Washington for months.
Before this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about a micro to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the President by 25th amendment.
Rosenstein took these statements.
However, last Monday, he was presented to the Black House, while he was on the point of demission.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Jewish.
Trump indicated that he would not prefer to send Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was reported to avoid a resistance with the audience of the Secretary Commission of the Senate, before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual attacks.
Friday, Trump asked the FBI to carry out a weekly investigation on the statements ported against Kavanaugh, keeping the vote of the Senat.
Wednesday, the Trump press attack, Sarah Sanders, made a look at Fox News.
Asked on the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been fixed for this, it may be this week, I could see if it remains a week after all other things happening to the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I like to hold the press in the current."
The confirmation would be convinced by certain journalists: Since September 10, Sanders had no press conference to the House-Blanche.
The animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of the conferences was not due to a conversion for the television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they have the gallery."
Then she left to hear that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without evidence, she added that “the President participates in more questions of answers than any other president before him”: “We have checked the numbers.”
The pressing conferences will always be placed, says Sanders, but "if the pressure has the chance to question directly the President of the United States, it is infinitely better to talk to me.
We are trying to do it often, you have seen it well last weeks, and this will take place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Regularly, Trump responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with dictators.
It's amazing that it's going to make press conferences in the solo.
This week, in New York, the President may have shown why, faced a detonated appearance and at the time a strange appearance before the collected journalists.

That's why I wanted to repeat the contribution of each member of the personnel, which is its nationality.
Coleans originating from the EU and then bring a precious experience and competences that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and welcome patients and communities that we serve.
The Scotland is actually your house, and we really want you to stay here."

Foreign purchasers will be submitted to a higher timber right if they buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign purchasers should pay higher timber rights if they buy a property in the United Kingdom and the additional money will be used to help them without open in the framework of new conservators
This measure will cancel the success of the campaign carried out by Corbyn to attack young electorers
The highest of the timber right will be imposed to those who do not pass to the United Kingdom
The Tresor is waiting to collect to 120 million Sterling books per year to help without-abries.
Foreign purchasers will be submitted to a higher tariff of timber if they buy a property in the United Kingdom - the additional money will serve to help without April, to announce Theresa May today.
This measure will be performed as a initiative to neutralize the success of the campaign of Jeremy Corbyn to attack young electorers in order to provide more advanced apartments and target people who win high income.
The highest of the timber right will be imposed to individuals and enterprises who do not pay payments in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will serve to strengthen Government's efforts in the fight for helping them without open.
This surface - which has been added to the right of the current timber, including the highest levels instaured two years ago on the secondary residences and acats-locations - could be achieved by 3 %.
The Tresor waits for the project to collect to 120 million Sterling books per year.
At least 13% of the new London buildings are acquired by non-residents of the United Kingdom, which brings the prices to smooth and prevents the first-accedients to make a place on the market of residence.
Many rich areas of the country - in particular in capital - were become “excellent cities” because of the high number of foreign accommodators who live for the most time outside the country.
This new policy happens a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction of the timber right to help more young people to buy a first house.
With the large construction company to maintain the prices of immobilization at a high level by achieveing lands without use, he invited Ms May to renew the quotas on the apartments in order to regulate the “immobiliary disgrace” in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the area of residence, including the control of the leaders and the elimination of the “injury” exhibitions.
He also wants to give the advice of the most extensive powers to build new apartments.
Mrs May said: "The last year, I said that I would dedicate my mission to the renewing of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our market of broken lives.
The British will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is injustice that it is as easy for individuals who don't reside in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign societys, to buy a house as well as for British residents who work hard.
For many people too much, the dream of access to the property has become far away and the measure of unably remain too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead the Ecosse.
The technology of Sunderland, Jack Ross, explains that his “ultimate ambition” is to become the economic electoral at a given time.

He raised the Stadium of Light after he brought St Mirren in Premier League the last saison.
“ I had to play for my country as a player.
I have been chosen for the B and it's all," said Ross to the Sportsound of the BBC Scotland.

This opportunity would not be, in contrast, only if I succeed in the management of the club.”
Ross' previewers as special electorers of Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The old technology of Alloa Athletic states that he has not been able to rent behind the names too emblematic in a large club, which has already stated Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured to the light of the question, ” can I return this club to Premier League?
From the structure and the infrastructures of this club, this is no doubt to the Prime League," he added.
"It's not easy to happen, but I'd probably not consider a success here, but if I'm going to bring the club back there."
Ross has only three years of carrier as a trainer, after a period as assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts' trainers.
He then helped Alloa to replace a reference in the third division and transformed St. Mirren, who was on the border of the relegation, in a great winter of the campionate, the next saison.
Ross is now mentioned more about his carrier to Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
The support of Alloa “with sure it was a real carrier,” remembers it.
"I really found that I was a teacher better than playing.
It seems weird because I've done it well, that I won my life well and I enjoyed some favorable summers.
But playing is sometimes hard.
There are many details to regenerate each week.
I continue to live this in stress and tension to work, but I'm a teacher, I'm very well.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do it, I feel more in my piece that I have not been of all my adult life."

Online, a publicity on the shooter that compares mothers and vaccines divides the opinions
A online publicity of a society proposing a shooter to compare the mothers with the vaccins during the treatment.
To mark the launch of what is qualified of "the first tire-law silent in the world", Elvie, a large public technology company, has started a wide publicity inspired from a musical videoscope to show the freedom that his new tire-law offers to allitating women.
In a branch of eggs filled with feed, four true mothers dance in the ritme of a song which are the words: "Yes, I give myself myself, but you don't see cow" and "In the case you wouldn't not notice it, these are my lips, not my lips."
The refrigerator continues: "Pop it, pomp it, I eat the babys, pomp it, pomp it, pomp it, I help women keeping the lake."
However, publicity, which was published on the Facebook page of the society, has submitted a online polemic.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradict reactions from the public, which many say that it makes light on the 's horrors' of the late industry.
“A smaller decision that is to use vaccines to promote this product.
Like us, they must fall born and give birth to produce the lake, except that their babys are removed to them in the days of their birth, ” wrote one of them.
The Latian tire Elvie applies discreetly in an aid (Elvie/Mother)
Another comments said: "It's an understandable traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't you use them to make the publicity of a shooter for mothers who keep their baby?
Somebody else added: "A publicity as disconnected."
Others defended publicity, for example, a woman who admitted that she found the “hilaring song. ”
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would have buyed one if I was still in the train of training.
Pomper gave me the impression to be a vacuum.
The publicity is a little painful, but I took it for what she was.
It's a great product," wrote somebody.
One of the other commented: “It is a joyful publicity for the mothers who took their lake (because on their worksplace or towels), and they feel like “vakes. ”
This is not a publicity that makes the latiar industry.”
At the end of the video, women appear to have danced with disciplines dyssimized in their support-gorge.
The concept behind the campaign looks on the idea that many women who use the shooter say that they have the pressure of beauty.
However, Elvie is completely silent, without sons or ships and increasingly discreetly in a discreasing support, which gives women the freedom of move, keep their baby and even out with their lake.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE in Mother commented: “The shooter of Elvie is a so revolutionary product that he measures an audacious and provocator launching.
While we made a parallel between the laiting mothers and laiters, we wanted to put the accent on the extraction of the maternal lake and all its deficits, while expressing a funny and faithful way the incredible feeling of freedom that this new shot would be searched.
It's not the first time that Elvie shoots one of the journals.
During the week of the mode in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while she used this product.
Hundreds of migrants were installed in silence in a camp at the border of the Texas
The number of migrant children has increased strongly that the number of monthly pass to the borders remain relatively stabil, and this is partly due to the fact that the talks and the severe policies of Trump's administration have made to comply with children's place in responsibility.
Thirdly, most of the responsors were themselves immigrants without papers, and they were afraid to check their own opportunity to stay in the country by bringing themselves to a child's rescue.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential responses and adult members of their family should submit their digital dealings and that these data would be transmitted to the authorities of the immigration.
Matthew Albence, a high officer of the Ministry of Immigration and Douane, tested the last week before the Congress that the Agency had stopped tens of persons who had made a request for uncompanied minors.
The Agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested persons were not of judges.
"Before 80 per cent of persons who are responsible or members of their family are illegally here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Thus, we continue to continue these people, ” says Mr. Albence.
According to the refugee intervenants, in order to train the case of children, the authorities have established new rules that will impose some of them to compare the court in the next month, at least 60 days, which was the standard before.
Many of them will compare by video conference, instead of anyone, to ask their cause in respect of their legal statute before a judge of immigration.
The unelectionable persons will be quickly cut out.
According to the intervenants and reports that have been presented by the Refugees network, children remain longer in detention, more they are able to become angry or depressive, which can generate violence or escape trials.
In a large set of as Tornillo, these concerns are considered by the fact that the signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more susceptible to be neglected because of its size, according to the defenders of the rights of the child.
They added that the movement of children to the camp without give them the time to prepare emotionally or to say to their friends could accumulate a traumatism that many have bad to control.
Syria requests the American, French and Turkish "occupied forces" to be removed on-le-champ.
In an allocation before the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called the Syrian refugees to return to them, even though war in this country is now in his eighth year.
Moualem, who also is Vice-Prime Minister, declared that the foreign forces were in the Syrian ground illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would “they would be treated in consecution.”
"They must be removed immediately and without condition," he said to the assembly.
Moualem supported that “the war against terrorism is almost finished” in Syria, while more than 3600,000 people are dead since 2011 and that millions of others have been dead from their families.
He indicated that Damas would continue to “avoid this holy battle until all the Syrian territory are cleansed ” as well as two terrorist groups and any“ illegal alien presence ”.
The United States count a number of 20,000 soldiers in Syria, which most of them form and advise at the time the core forces and the Syrian Arabians who oppose the President Bachar al-Assad.
In this country rebelled by the war, France counts more than 10,000 soldiers in place.
Moualem stated on the refugees that the conditions were favorable to their return, and sent “ certain western countries” to “propagate irrational concerns” that the refugees had dismissed to return.
"We called the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easily," he said.
“They are trying to policy what should be a pure humanitarian question.”
The United States and the European Union have made aware that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria as a political agreement between Assad and the opposition for the end of this war would not be concluded.
The United Nations diplomates claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the creation of a tampon area in the last rebellion force of Idlib has allowed to progress political negotiations.
The Russian Turkish Agreement has evited a large scale at the province where three million people live by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem, however, underlined that the Agreement prevented the “specific periods” and expected the hope that military measures would go to the Djihadists, in particular the fighters of the Front Nusra, which are linked to Al-Qaeda, and who will be “removed. ”
Mistura Staffan, representative of the United Nations, hopes to invite the first meetings of a new committee collecting members of the Government and the Opposition to edit a post-guard constitution and to prepare the path to the elections in Syria.
Moualem has defined the conditions of participation of the Syrian Government to the Committee, saying that the work of the group should be limited to the review of the articles of the current constitution, and made a holding against any inheritance.
Why Trump will bring a second mandate
According to this logical, Mr. Trump would be reviewed in 2020, except if, as many free telespectors hoped, the destitution and the scandal lead him to the presidency.
What would be “The most spectacular end of a Presidency!”
In this time, the public shows no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, the costs at the point hours have more than duplicate than 1,05 million on the CNN, and they have practically triped, amounting to 1,6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nillen, Fox News accounts in average 2,4 million telespectors at large audience hours, against 1,7 million years ago, and the "Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC, which has achieved 3,5 million telespectors during the greatest nights, is the first chain of TV by cabbag.
"It's a matter to attack people because it's not about anything we understand," commented Neal Baer, representative of the dramatic series of the ABC "Designed Survivor" who talks about a Minister who becomes president after a attack destroying the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a chevroned comic orphan of "Just the Funy Parts: And some unrefutable truths on the fact of sliping in the Hollywood Boys' Club," has a different teorie for him.
She reminds her to take a taxi in Boston before the elections of 2016.
The chauffeur told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked her.
"He replied, "It's like he's going to smile me," said Mrs. Scovell.
The chaos has a game value.
Of course, in contrast to everything that happens to the television, Washington scenarios could determine the future of the Roe C. Wade business, if immigrant families can gather together and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most forced telespectors can be allowed.
However, this is more than the fact of being a citizen informed when it is found to look for a six-hour expert panel in the way Bob Woodward served a "deep knowledge-fair" for his book "Fear" on the clothes to build a 15 000 dollars of Paul Manfort (“a rhyme of orgue” according to Washington Post) and the consequences of extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels had delivered from it, the Anatomy of M. Trump.
From my side, I'll never see Super Mario anymore in the same way.
"If a part of what he makes the impression of seeing a tele-reality emission, it is because he makes you aware of something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Director general of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changeing teams and returns of Trump quotidian situation (from fighting with NFL, welcome Kim Jong-un).
We can't let us miss a episode if we're on the train.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees in his house at the north of Kauai river, but he was inside to look at MSNBC recording the CNN.
He couldn't be disappeared, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was prepared to face the Court of the Senat and the future of the Supreme Court in the game.
"I remember the time we animated all these stupid emissions and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the western civilization," Mr. Fleiss trusted me.
“I thought it was a kind of lying, but he felt that they were right. ”

The money of the outside was invading the most serious elections of half-management
It is not surprised that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is injured of money, through a reform of the circumscriptions of the Congress, which allowed two titulars to discuss the same seat.
This district of Pittsburgh's bathroom, which recently has been restructed, is the seat of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who described his seat in another circumscription in special elections at the last presimps.
Lamb is measured to another titler, the Republican Keith Rothfus, which currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly the new 17th district.
The cards were resigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania stated, in January, that older reliefs were unconstitutively manipulated for the republicans.
The course of the new 17th District has given the point of a resistance on the financing of the electoral campaigns between the large branches of the funding of the parties, the Congress Committee for Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Committee of Republican campaign (CNCR).
Lamb became a well known name in Pennsylvania after a victory of righteousness in March last in a very popular election in the 18th district of the Pennsylvania Congress .
This seat was arrested by a republian since more than a decade and President Donald Trump brought the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists gave a lower benefit to democracies.
The United States invited to penalize the Salvador for its support for China, and then returned
The diplomats have constated that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Pekin, which Washington has been a little opposite.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with the Panemian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners exit the direction of the Organization Trump.
The representatives of the State Department have decided to convocate the chiefs of American diplomatic missions to Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama to protect against “their recent decisions to not recognize Taiwan”, made Heather Nauert, the door of the department, at the beginning of the month in a communicated.
However, sanctions have been provided only in the meeting of Salvador, which has benefited from an American aid estimated to $140 million in 2017, in particular to control drugs and to provide support for development and economic plans.
The invisible sanctions, including the reductions of financial assistance and restrictions on visa, would have been painful for the country of Central America and its high levels of commitment and murder.
While the internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America have retained a high-level conference that had for the subject of security and economic prosperity to follow an analog meeting that has been last year, as a progress in the efforts to prevent immigrants to return to the United States.
But in the middle September, high responsibilities of administration have clearly indicated that they wanted to continue the conference, taking into account all the consideration of sanctions against the Salvador.
The Vice-President Mike Pence is now eighteen expressing in the conference, provided for the Middle-October, to show the importance of the administration agreed to the meeting, have made the diplomates.
And the three American emissors were quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe puffs from Washington.
A port of Mr. Bolton in the Blanche House refused to comment the details of the debate described by the three American dictators, including two diplomates, which have accepted to discuss internal delegations under the cover of anonymate.
Their proposals were corrupted by an independent analysis close to the administration, which also remained anonymous.
Study History
The next ticket may be the report of the special lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible income to Mr. Trump's justice. The public document is then established by substance evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also address his research to the question of a conviction of Mr. Trump campaign with Russia in his attack against our elections.
If the control of the Congress changes hand, Mr. Trump will be found in the obligation to make accounts before this body, at the time he is approved to represent the electors and, perhaps, before a committed jurisdiction of his partners.
There are many "she," and I don't imagine that Mr. Trump's challenge is inevitable - or the of his homologs in Europe.
We all have decisions to take from both sides of Atlantic, which will reflect on the potential period of this fight.
In 1938, the German officers were on the point of organizing a couple of states against Hitler, if only the West had taken his head and replaced the Checoslovacs in Munich.
We missed, and we missed a chance to escape the years of carnage they followed.
The course of the history turns around these climates and the inelectual walk of the democracy is accurate or retard.
The Americans are currently confronted with some of these climates.
What will we do if Mr. Trump returns the advice to Mr. Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the expenditure of the investigation carried out by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein is in a delicate situation since this journal reported that, last year, he proposed to register the President secretly and put hypotheses on his inaptitude to exercise his functions.
Mr. Rosenstein states that the report of the Times is inexact.
"What will we answer if the research recently requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confined to the Supreme Court without sexual accusations and false witnesses?
And above all, are we going to vote to the elections of the Middle-Man's elections for a Congress that will ask Mr. Trump accounts?
If we don't succeed these tests, democracy will pass a long hiver.
But I'm convinced that we're not missing because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a checoslovac Jewish who carried out in Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who was occupied by the past my residence of a busy.
She survived, immigrated in America, and, sixty years later, sent me to summarize the Saturday chairs on the table that treated the swasts.
With this patrimoine in heritage, I can't be optimist about our future. ”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, trusting face in Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Jeudi, while knowing that the victory faces to the Austrians, after the printing matching no in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify the G Group in the European Ligue.
A genetic lesion privated the middle of the landing Graham Dorrans from its first participation of the saison until the match 2:2 against Villarreal, but it is convinced that Rangers are in the way to take the best of such results to realize exploits.
“ It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," commented the attacker of 31 years.
“ We entered into the game, thinking to get something, and we shared it with a point.
Maybe we could bring it to the end, but, in the whole, no match was probably a correct result.
They were probably better at the first half time and we returned to the second half-time and we were the best team.
Jeudi, it's another important European evening.
With a little chance, we can hope to get three points, but this will be a difficult match because they have done a good result during their last match, yet I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the people behind us.
The last year was really difficult, between my wounds and changes brought to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction on this place now.
The team is good and the guys are very happy; training is quality.
We hope we can go before now, leave the last saison behind us and triompher."
Women are no longer dreams because of the fear of their retraite equipment
Even if the participants in this summer knew clearly how they wanted to be occupied of them, little people would discuss the question with their family members.
During the half of people who participated in the national study, they stated that they were talking with their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent have stated that they have talked to their children.
“ People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they do not need to have this conversation," explains Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the NationWide Security Bank.
This is where to start.
Talk to your colleagues and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't communicate them your desires before.
Collaborate with your advice and your family to determine where and how you can receive care, because these options can be a important factor to determine the cost.
Call your financial advice: Your advice is also in order to help you set a way to pay these costs.
Your long-term financial decisions may include a police of ensure of traditional long-term long-term long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy in the value of rachat to help you cover these expenditures or other ensure on your patrimoine - if you have the methods to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Evit the legal battles on the past.
Provide a research on health cares that will allow you to design a confidential person who will check your medical cares and ensure that professionals respect your desires if you are not able to communicate.
Also consider a research on your financial resources.
You would choose a person of confidence that will take financial decisions for you and will ensure the payment of your facts if you are incapable.
Think about small details: We suppose your age has a medical urgency and he's going to the hospital.
Would you like to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Call these details in a written document to be ready well.
"No only the financials are in the game, but also who are the doctors?", asked Martin.

"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked, a limited investigation at the time, limited in his port - maybe we could bring a few units," said Mr. Flake Samedi, adding that he feared that the committee would not "from" in a partial impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his republian parties want the FBI to investigate?
Their reticence is due to the election of the moment.
Middle elections will be located only in five weeks, or on 6 November. If, as proposed, the republicans will do a bad score, they will seriously be able to make the person to choose the highest court of the country.

There will be a vote in the Senat, where now 51 Republicans and 49 democrates are sitting.

Pelosi was held when he was asked if she was trying to establish Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the democracies had received the majority in the room of representatives.
“If he does not say the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but it is also inappropriate to sit in the court where he is present,” said Pelosi.
Currently, Kavanaugh is judged by the DC call Court.
Pelosi also added that as a democracy, she was concerned by eventually decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered as a conservative judge.
During the audience of charges confirmation, Mr. Kavanaugh raised the question of the possible reversation of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to the court and wait for what we say, "It's not wonderful," said Pelosi.
And women have to use them.
It's a legal diatribe, months and years of wrath, and she can't make it out without weeping.
“ We weep when we're hungry, ” Mrs. Steinem told me about 45 years later.
“ I don't think it's weird, and you? ”
"I was very helped by a woman who was a frame of somewhere, who said to me that she was also weeping when she was angry, but she developed a technology that allowed her to tell the person who she talked to her, when she was angry and weeping, "You can think I'm sad because I'm weeping.
I'm angry. ”
And then she continued.
And I found that brilliant."
The lambs are allowed to be exhausted to wrath, in particular because they are fundamentally incomprehensive.
One of my most famous memories of a first employment, in a domain office of men, where I was found in a day to cry out of an unexpressible rage, was to have been introduced by the hair of a age - a frog directrice that had always been a little terrified - who entered me into a scale.
"Don't let them see you weeping in any case," she told me.
They don't know that you are angry.
They believe you sad and are courageous because they have received you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Deputy of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was taken into a extra-conjugal case on a boat called Monkey Business and was departed from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason to explore the idea that she was not exploited to the presidency.
“It wasn't an exciting decision, ” she trusted me, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and the last thing he missed was one more person.
Someone called this "Blanche-Neige and the Sept Nains".
As the campaign was very advanced, she had taken back in the fund collection, so she sweared that she would not participate at least 2 million dollars.
The battle was lost forward.
She learned that some of her participants who usually gave 10,000 dollars to men would not give him only 250 dollars.
"Do they believe I have right to a rabbit?" she asked.
When she announced in her talk that she would not start of official campaign, she had been broken by her emotions - thanks to people who had supported it, frustration faces to the system that makes so difficult the collection of funds and the target of electors instead of delegated, and the wrath against sexualism - that she feels extortion.
“You would have believed I had a nervous depression, ” remembered Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of pressure on his face.
“You thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember I was asked what they were going to put on my grave stone.
"He wept"?
