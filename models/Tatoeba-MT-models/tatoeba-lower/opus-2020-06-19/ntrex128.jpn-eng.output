The proposal was to be amended by the Conference of Walls (Assembly Member) to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament) from AM.
It's a plan to change the name of the Walls Conference.
All members of the political parties are surprised to invite this to be crazy.
One of the employees are surprised that the "Twp" and "Pwp" are in the party.
If you explain to the readers other than the Wales, Twp in the Wales language has been "what" means "whot".
A member of the Pride Camli Party proposed an alternative proposal as the whole party was "independence".
A parliamentary of the Walls Conservative Party said that the same name is "open", but it may not be very different from the MWP and Manucket.
The word "w" of the Wales is similar to the English "u" of Yorkshire.
Now, the Committee of the Secretary-General on the amendment of the amendment stated: "The final decision on the opinion of the Parliament is to be sent to the Secretary-General to himself."
According to the Government of Wales in 2017, the Walls Conference has the right to change its name.
In June, the Committee declared that the Committee had a great name in the name of the Parliament from Assembly to Welsh Parliament, which published the results of the Civil Assembly against this proposal.
On the name of the senator, the Communities supported the proposal of the WMP (Welsh Parliament), but in the citizens, the MWP proposed the greatest support.
In fact, the senator has proposed an alternative proposal, but in the way to get agreement, there may be a head pain for the Senator Ellin Jones for a few weeks, which is required to submit a statute proposal on the name.
The legislation on this reform will also include other reforms on the procedures of the Parliament on the structure of the Committee's Constitution, including the unbelievers' regulations and the structure of the Commission.
In the procedure of the law, the senators will have the final right to decide on what they should call.

For most of my eight years of the local workshop, the GC meeting on Friday night was just like this.
I've been forgotten to be a lot of meetings today, not for many meetings, but for a long time I've been forgotten the promise of the policy.
It is only clear that the workshops are not accepted by various opinions, and that all the opinions will be accepted to the leaders of the party.
This was just after Jeremy started as a leader, and the colleagues thought that I had shared such political opinions as I was before, and they wanted to take a position, but they would have agreed with the national security and the only EU market.

I never hid my policy, including the previous elections.
No one had been confused in Notting Guest in the field of my political position and managers.
For people who moved it on Friday, I say that the country is a family, business, and a breggyt that hurts our public services, and I don't understand the desirable energy of my loyalty to time and workshop leaders.
But my message from me is not to the admonition of Nottingham, but to my supporters, I promise that I don't control the actions from my faith that you are all the best.

John Edward: Global citizens needed language scroll.
Scotland's private school has learnedly well-pleased achievements, and it continues to be a new set of better test results that are strengthened only by sports, arts, music and other community's realities.
These schools who have more than 300,000 students in the field of Scotland, SCIS, are trying to provide the highest level for students and protectors.
Private scholars mean that students are high education, their chosen carriage, and as global citizens are prepared to live in society.
In this education sector, we know that modern languages are still aware of the school's holiday.
Nelson Mandera said, "When you can understand, it's going to go into the head of a man.
"It's what I'm going to say in the language of that man, that's going to be in the heart of that man. "
This is a reminder of us that we should not only trust in English when we build relationships and confidence with other countries.
In the recent tests of this year, the language has the top of the Leg table, and the highest rate of private students is higher.
The total 68 per cent of students who learn foreign languages have received high-gradeA.
In the data collected from the SCIS College 74, 72 per cent of students who learned Beijing languages have received high-gradeA, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students, and 63 per cent of the Spanish learning languages have received A.
This shows that Scotland's private school is an important scroll that needs children and young people in the future to encourage foreign language learning.
The language is currently processed as the choices such as the STEM, the science, the technologies, the mathematics.
In the investigation of the British Employment Committee in 2014, I knew that 17 per cent of the employees had suffered to fulfill the employees.
So, young people have a language scroll to prepare for future carriage.
These scrolls are in need for more than one of the opportunities of work to be needed by globalization.
If you choose any carriage, if you get foreign languages, you'll have such life's scale, and you'll be really worthy of the future.
It means that the multilingue materials will be better in competition with the people of the foreign people.
YouGov, investigated over 4,000 British adults in 2013, was not enough foreign languages to talk to 75%, but two cycles of the languages who were speaking were only 15 percent of French.
That's why we're going to do investment in language education.
In particular, the children of the developing country will be higher to get a valuable job with many languages.
In Scotland, there are different languages to teach every school.
In many schools, they are focused on more traditional modern languages, but in other schools, they will learn the most important language in England, such as Beijing, Japan, and 2020.
If children are interested in what they're, they're in private schools who are specialists of this section.
Scotland's private schools contribute to the future to provide educational environments that make children prepared for the future and provide the need for success.
In the global business environment, the language is continuously important for the future of the country, and it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, the modern language should be the International Communication Scil.
Private school will continue to provide this choice and diversity and better education for young people in Scotland.
It's good to do it.
John Edward is the leader of Scotland Private Advisory.

Larry, West Berginian, YouTube Channel.
President Donald Trump begins a series of election meetings from Wealing in West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of the meetings in the next week, including tensions and mishippies, including a friendly place in the camps.
Now when the Supreme Court's votes are approved, the campaign points out that the Republic Party has a risk to lose the average of the elections of the Parliament in November, and supporting the interim elections.
When will we go to the meetings in West Berginian tonight, and how can we listen online?
The meeting at Western Burginia in the Trump is planned on Saturday 29 September 2018 at 7:00 (East Standard).
Larry, in Westberginy of the Trump, can listen online on the following live streams on YouTube.
While the FBI investigates the sexual offence of the Supreme Court of Justice Bret Cabano, it is highly possible to comment on the audience of Cabano this week.
But the main objective of this meeting to continue is to attach the forces of the Republic Party to fight against the difficult elections of November.
According to Royter, the next week's five meetings in the campaign of the Chairman of Translation are designed to enhance volunteer and saporter levels to promote a half-congress in the capital and the department.
"It is very important for his policy, because the president will visit many states, and the campaign of anonymous campaign, who wants anonymous campaign, says to Royter.
According to the Metro News of Western Burginia, the meetings planned in Western Bankoriana may be gathered from Ohio and Pennsylvania and published in Pittsburgh's media.
The campaign winds more than 40% in West Virginia in 2016, but western Berginian visits will be the second visit in a month or month.
The tromb is trying to support Patrick Molly, the Republic Congress of West Berginian, who is late in the world investigation.
According to Royter, the politician of West Berginian University Simon Hader said, "the President is not a good sign for Mollysy."
Leader Caps 2018: The United States election shows the intention to fight with the hope of the Sunday Singles.
After the three sessions of the same result, the forum on Sunday afternoon was expanded where it was required.
In the sports, the idea of "power" as a dream is not based, but especially in such competition, the electorer really believes "power".
So, what's going on to have?
"It was six points, but I think we've got a little bit, because it's been four points now."
Of course, the European election is left 12 games and 4 points, and it's high.
As the speech says, the United States elections feel along the wind, playing together each day, and adding the speech and Justin Thomas are good, and there are many good reasons.
The speech is attached from the Tee to Green, and remains positive results.
He and Thomas were 2 points after two horses, but when the round passed, the voice of the blessing was great, and he locked the decision-patch and took the fourth game.
He was told his faith that he had not lost the American election team.
"We have to focus on your games and make all the powers."
Now, these electors only want to leave each game.
I'll win 18 halls.
In these two days, the electorer who increased more points of speech and Thomas is only the biggest subject of Francesco Morinari and Tommy Freewood.
These two of the European elections that love to be changed by changers, they raised up four winnings in four wars.
These two named "Morewood" were not only the only part of the boogie at the Sunday session, but they refused the boogie at the Sunday morning, Sunday morning, and half 9 hours after Sunday.
If you see the energy that goes to this game, you can see two energy between the weak people, you know, they're a pioneer to fall on the Sunday, and you're not going to move the winning of the European elections in the final war of Lu Golf National, you'll have no choices than Freewood or Morinal.
We both want to get it at the same time in another hall.
But the European election has not yet decided to win.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson won easily for Forball hero in the morning, Sergio Garcia and Alex Norren.
Garcia and Lennon couldn't be able to go back after they buried a tomb through Boggie and two duplicate bodies in the former 9 halls.
We don't have any friends to help.
Forball and Forsam are very amazing to look closely at the change of the moment of the strategy.
The European elections have been a better plan as a team, and to the last day, but in the Forum Session, the United States elections have been shown that the United States' elections wanted to purchase the insecurity of the United States.
The last day, the European election was 10-6.
The European election leads 10-6 to the United States elections at the end of the Saturday Forum and Forum Game, and goes to the last day of the Leader Caps.
Tommy Freewood and Francesco Morinary, showing a wonderful activity, set two winnings against Tyger Woods, and spread the score in Le Golf National to four points.
Tomas Vion, the European election of Thomas Vion, who had two years ago lost Trophy in Hazeltin, controlled an uncertain American election in Forbour in the morning, and became the score 3-1.
The United States elections took the gas in the Forum and win two games, but they couldn't even lose the point.
The United States elections, Jim Furyk, needs to get 8 points on the Sunday Singles 12 games to keep the Trophy.
Freewood was not only the first lucky of Europe, which was raised up four points, but the second part of the "moliwood" after the weekend after the weekend.
After they descended Woods and Patrick Reed in the Forbour, they showed a fine end, and they won the score of 5 and 4.
Two Saturday games, Woods have shown a time-breaking game, but not only 19 games in Forbour and Forsam were lost from 29 games, but seven ransoms were cutting.
Justin Rose, who took a relax in the forum in Forum with Henry Stanson in the Forum, shocked the world's 1 and the 3-year-old Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka on 2 and 1-year-old.
Paris's West Coast is this day as a good day of the wind blowing, but it doesn't control the European election.
Jordan Speece and Justin Thomas, three of the Meger Leaders, showed the basis for two points on the United States elections on Saturday.
After they win in the Forbour, they won John Ram and Ian Paul, Spanish, both and one, and they lost the first two halls in Forum, and they win Paul and Rory McCloy.
In the history of Lidercaps, there are no two examples for past, but the American elections in Furyk can only be able to keep the trip in separately.
But, for the United States elections that passed through two days, it seems to be more than their capacity.
North Korea says, "No absolutely."
North Korean Foreign Ministry said that the United Nations had been incredible to the United Nations on Saturday, and that there was no nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
In the United Nations Year Congress, the Norway Korea stopped nuclear experiments, mixed exploitation experiments, and the nuclear experiments, and not expanded nuclear weapons and nuclear technology in the past year.
He said, "But there's no appropriate responsibility from the United States."
"If you trust the United States, our national security is lost, and we do not have an army in this situation."
Lee outstands repeated that there is no reward from the United States Government of North Korea in North Korea, but that his statement is that the north Korean government has not immediately rejected the non-nexualization.
Lee Outstand promised the first counsel with the President of the United States and the North Korean leader of the President of Singapur in July 12, and that the Trump promised the Security of North Korea's Security.
North Korea requests a regular end of the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States says that the North Korea needs to leave nuclear weapons first.
The American Government also refused to reject several international laws against North Korea.
"Americans designed "the Prime of the Uncertainty" and strengthened the purposes, and more pressures in the court, against the "Finish Declaration" and said to Lee outside.
"It's the idea of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that our unbelieving feelings are strengthened by the end of the court. "
Lee outside, the President of the Trump was in the United Nations first week, and he didn't tell the second plan of the cerebral consultation of the money and the tramp.
Instead, in the past five months of gold and Corean's three conversation with the President Mun Jain, and added: "If non- nuclear problems are not the United States, the Korean island would have been cut off there."
In fact, the Tone of Lee's outside talks calls the money "the evil president", and the tramp called "rocketman" in the self-explosion, and it was dramatically different that the North Korean Rockets in the United States were not allowed to arrive in the United States.
In the United Nations this year, when the North Korea was "completely destroyed", the tromp that was threatened in the United Nations for the courage for armed disarmament, but there were many issues, and it was necessary to keep the regulatory until the North Korea is unnexected.
"Translaw on Wednesday, two years or three years, maybe five months."
China and Russia stated that the United Nations Security Court should reward the measures of North Korea.
But the United Nations Security Court of the United States President Mike Pompeo says, "The Security Court must continue hardly until it is completely unnewed."
Since 2006, Security strengthens all conventions to northern Korea in order to discharge funds for the development of nuclear and balance mixtures.
Pompeo talked with Lee outside in the United Nations Conference, and then he said that the next month was visiting the world again.
Pompeo visited the North Korea three times this year, but the last visit was not achieved.
He told him that he had progress in July, but in that few hours, the North Korea's request as a gang.
The North Korea promised that if the United States took the "reasonable measures" in consultation with the Victor President this month, the mission and nuclear equipment were resolved.
He told him that he's a "reasonable measure" he asked, that the tromb is a security that he promised in Singapur, and he told him that it's normalizing the relationship with the American government.
Harvard's student, and I'm going to get enough rest.
In the new coast of Harvard University this year, all students have more dreams to take the cafein and fight the growth of the Maccho culture that is studying in Ornight.
The world's students of Harvard University are often unknown about the very basic way they have the body.
Charles Zasler designed this cos. He thinks that he was the first American cos.
When he talked about the impact of the dreams, he thought that he started this cost.
And I said, "Why do you hear that I'm going to be four years old?"
He said to her, "He said to the telegraph.
In the first year, this year's first work, I'll tell students how good sleep habits are promoting study and motional capacity, and how to improve the general Wellbying.
Paul Barlalla, a psychologist professor in Harvard University of Medical Services, decided to introduce the Cos after he recognized a serious dream of the student in that week.
One hour's curse contains a number of interactive tasks.
In some sections, students can know about the importance of the room of coffee, carten, sniker, the book to click on the effects of cafeine and light, the impact of the ability of sleepless ability, and the importance of the day school on sleep.
In another section, the participants explain how long-term dreams can be developed, in the brain disaster, in the risk of diseases and cancer risks.
Also, on the map of the interactive icons distributed by the campaign, it encourages you to think about the participants about the day school.
"I know that student's action doesn't change immediately.
But they should have the right to know, and they have the right to know how the choice of the fuel affects the health.
The culture of the whole night's education is now present, and the increase of the preacher for modern technologies and students is increased by the problem of sleeplessness.
It's a lot of dreams, a secret weapons of students to fight and to fight insecurity, so he says that the dream is always hungry in the brain mode, and he can keep hungry, and he says that he's preventing the growth of the body.
The 19-year-old California's chemicals and physical physics, Raymond Sow (19-year-old), took a class of Professor Zasler in Harvard University last year, and helped his cos design.
He was awakened by his coast, and he was going to think he wanted to increase the coast in the whole campaign.
The next step he wants is to get the same learning program before all colleagues start to learn in a huge place called Harvard.
Professor Zaislar recommends to set a alarm in the same time as the students at the beginning of the dream time, and the electronic screen and LED lights, and to note the painful "Bluelight" influence of the surface of the surface of the surface of the lysm and the problem of sleeping.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's Golf Down the range of Jerrade
Rangers also buried the corruption in Away, and by the Gold of the Rivingstone, Dry Menga, the rangers who lost Steven Gerards were destroyed in 1-0.
Rangers, who was based on Avey's first winning from the 4-1 winning of February in Sant Johnston, was raised against Rivingston, Gary Holt's rate, and Gerard shot the second ransom in 18 games, and Rangers opened 8 points against the head of Scotish Premier Ship.
Menga has raised the gold before the heft time seven minutes, and then it didn't seem to be raised by the raingers that are missing inspiration.
Rangers are now fallen into six, but Livingstone has moved to the following three levels to the Hyberniane.
In addition, the Colomn Spencers of the linear court had to have to be taken from Away's visits and have to be carried out of the head's head, and there may be more problems in Rangers.
Gerard changed eight members when he broke the Aer and moved to the Victory of Betfred Caps and came to this game.
At the same time, Holt holded Elibon as when he took a point from the last week, and it would be glad that he was trained with each member of the office.
Rangers wind the property, but Livingstone was efficiently attacked in a few posts.
After the beginning, two years later, Scott Pittman's first path from the Manga's first path, Scott Pittman was protecting Alan McCleger's goal, but he's going to escape a decisional chance outside the side.
And then, Mr. Craig Harket's freekick in the Penalty Area in Keigan Jacobs, and Alan Risgo, Difender, was cut down, but it was just on the back post.
Rangers ruled the balls, but in the Final Saad, he finalized a game based on hope.
The Colombian Alfred Morelos suggested a penalty when he conflicted with Steven Lawrence for 15 minutes, but he refused Morelos' appeal.
Rangers left two boards in the former border, but Gilliam Kelly, the old Rangers, saved the simple steel of Lassana Criveri and Obie Ejaria.
Livingston's former half-34 points were against the game flows, but no one can deny that it's a hard work gift.
Rangers couldn't handle James's set pieces in Penalty Area.
Declan Gallagher passed to Scott Robinson, and Robinson sent a path to Menga quietly, and Menga decided to make the gold easily, but Scott Arfield couldn't respond to it.
Jerrad has to replace Ryan Kent to Harf Times with Clivary, but it's once running, and Winger's Cliver sends a path to Morelos, but Kelly locked the bullet in a good save of the Goldline before.
But Livingston led a game with the game that he wanted to play, and the Risgo and Harket processed exactly the Longball that was sent to the following.
Livingstone, who has had a chance to spread a lead on the endboard, but Jacob's shoot was stopped by McLegger's good save, and the riggling shots from the conner were out of the side.
Glenn Middleton, Rangers who went out of the street, took a penalty when Jacobs was connected, but Tomson left it here.

The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system's unbelievable cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to kill the unbelievable cells.
The vaccine teaches to recognize an immune system of cells.
In this way, we're going to extract the immune cells from the patient and add changes in the laboratorie.
And more than this, cells can make the tampical quality that are common with many cancers, and they can re-include it.
The test vaccine shows the desirable results between the long-term cancer patients.
In the case of a woman who learned to recognize the immunity cells, the egg cancer was disappeared over 18 months.
In this way, if you extract the immune cells from the patient and add changes in the laboratorie, you can make a "determination" quality combined with many cancers called HER2, and then reinclude this cell.
Professor Jay Belzoffsky, in the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Besesda, Maryland, said: "In our results, the active ability of the vacation has been shown."
HER2 promotes the growth of the cancers, eggs cancers, linguistic cancers, and many cancers.

Maxine Waters, the statement of the Republic Senator of Staff refused to decline the data fraction of the Republic, "risk lie," "the conspiracy"
The United States Senator Macsin Walters denied the statement that one of her staff has sent three Republic Senators on the page of Wikipédia.
The Democratics of Los Angeles declared that this opinion was made by the super-right flags and the website.
"Like, lie, lie," and Walters said in Twitter's statement.
The information is reported by Senator Lindse Graham, South Carolina, South Carolina, and Michael Lee and Olyn Hatch's elections were included in the home address and phone numbers of the Senator Michael Lee and Olyn Hatch of Utah.
This information was published by anonymous Capitol Hill during the public audience of the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court of Complete Cabano.
This data disappeared after three senators asked Cabano.
Garden sites such as Gateway Pandite and RedState are reported by the IP address from the Waters' office and reported that the information of the Workers' employees were published.
"It's not based on this request is completely false, and it's absolutely lying." And Waters continued.
"My staff has been invaded by such false and false requests, identity, security, but they are not all involved in this information's failure.

"This refusal is not a wrath." And Frisher wrote.
"This showed that she wasn't responsible for the senator.
If you are accused to do what you didn't do, don't be angry.
Don't be arrogant.
You don't ask the motive of the accused.
We have to dance with calm and quiet. "
Frisher seems to be compared to the crisis of democratics and the responsibility of the democratics who are too angry about the situation of the Cabano judge in the Sunday audience.
In the middle elections, Omar Nabaro, a Republican candidate of the Congress of Waters, explained his opinion on Twitter.
"It's true." "It's true."

She says, "We'll make all power to declare the murderer," and says, "and the killer will lose legal responsibility for my staff's destruction and dangerous actions."

Of course, he's a stupid secret agent who's able to prepare his launched appreciation, but he has all the elements of the charakters who played only one of the launching theme in the London Olympique Congress in 2012.
Jonny Ingrish is also based on my mysterious world travellers in the television of Barclay cards, which are now forgotten.
I've got one or two good areas.
When Jonny Ingrish gets close to the helicopter with the middle of the world, it's better to put a sound on the lot that Rotor Bread has made the helmet.
It's also the genius of the commedy who carried the body of Atkinson, but, especially, it's a real film that includes the Commedy elements, and it's a lot of power, and it's a lot of amazing.
That humor feels like a child, not an adult, and a strange adventure of Johnny Ingrish for me feels not like a single gag, but not a focus.
In this film, the current permanent subject that the United Kingdom has a serious problem.
Cyber Hacker has entered the Internet in the United Kingdom, and has announced the identity of all British agents in the active, and the agent of Kevin Elton is a small role.
This news was more than the limits for the great president of support, and Emma Tompson has not been in the book that he works with the paradict of this Teresa Mai.
Her wise advisor has been published because all the real shops were published, and they have to collect the rejected spies.
That's why you work as a high school manager, and you're a secret employer, and you're inside.
Ingrish goes to the White Hall for the fast breeping, and you're going to meet Boff, who's a long-term partner who's worked for a long-term.
Boff is married and married with Vicky Pepperdain.
And the secret service of your King's Majesty is resurrected, and I'll meet the beautiful phem Fatal, Oficial Bretova.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister remains saying that the billion manager Jason Volta (Jack Raysey) can solve the suffering of the British computers.
Ingrish and Boff have caused a number of problems like the past, and weapons and struggles in a hot franchleastland, and they have been invading involving volta's hot yacht, and the Ingrish will use the barcharian headset to know involta's house.
I'm sure all the ships are gathered into the last mountain, but this Dotabatcomedy should be generally a program for children.
It's a very fair thing.
And even as Johnny Ingrish films, the British film industry couldn't think that it couldn't give Rowan Atkinson to his talent.
The Working Party refuses to consider the plans of payment for five days for a weekly work for the people.
Jeremy Covin's working party is a way to consider a radial plan that the people will pay five days for a week.
The group wants to share with the employees with the money that the industry has received through the human intelligence (AI) to increase the payment.
In this plan, the employees will have the same payment in three weeks.
The information stated that this idea was along with the economic actions and plans of the party to make a country that workers would be worthy of.
The migration to the fourth-day system is also reached from the Working Conference as a way that workers can change.
The Sunday Times Officers says: "The policy's review has been published until the end of the year.
"It's not possible for a night, but the work system of four days of week is to apply to the party's aproch and the total industrial strategy of the party to replace the economics as well as to workers."
The Green Party swears to the work system for a weekly 4 days in the campaign of 2017, and the Working Party is not the first time supporting that.
However, the whole work party does not support that objective.
"The work system of four weeks is not a party's way, but the party doesn't consider it."
The Ministry of the Shadow, Mr. John McDonal, in the last week's Working Conference, made a view to socialism revolution in economic.
Mr. McDonal said that there was a decision to return the power from the "invisible office" of the public business.
The plan of the Ministry of the Shadow means that the worksparty government may "distract" because it's unjustly recognised, and that the current actors of the water companies may not be able to return.
He also entered workers into the business office, built the owner funds and offered 10% of the funds of the civil business, and confirmed the plan to take up a maximum of 500 pounds of year.
Lynzee Gram and John Kennedy say that the FBI can change the thoughts in Cabano.
By the investigation of the FBI on the Court Bret Cabano, the final vote on the name of the Supreme Court was expired at least one week, and the results of the investigation of the Republic Senators were issued that the support of the members of the Communities would be dangerous.
In the interview sent to the Sunday, "60 minitz" Scott Perry asked if the Community Senator, Linse Gram and John Kennedy could find something that the FBI could change the thoughts.
Kennedy was opener than Gram, a South Carolina colleague.
"Obviously," said Kennedy.
"I told you to go to the audience, and I told you to talk to the judge Cabano.
So, after there was a statement, I called him and said, "Have you done it?"
He was decisive, and it was clear. "
But it seems to be unchanged by Gram's vote.
"I'm decided about Bret Cabano, and it's gonna be a serious disaster."
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I don't know.
"And no one who had given her name could be able to check it.
It's about 36 years.
I can't see new changes.

The American President Donald Trump denied the last weekend, but China was denied because he tried to interact China with the elections of the United States of November 6, and then reported the largest newspaper in Iowa, the chinese publisher in Demone Register.
The fuel that Beijing had tried to interact with the elections of the United States showed that the American authorities said to Royter, the campaign was a new stage of the campaign to make pressure in China.
The publication of trade progress is usually common for foreign governments, but Beijing and Washington are now in the middle of the trade wars to increase the same contribution to the imports.

We have a enemy tomorrow tomorrow.
We've got a different element from our personal performance tomorrow.

We need to send this message to all the electorers.

New Army in Germany, and again.
The German Sea Army was a new planning to the ship of the cold war in 2014, but the local media that could not be achieved at least to the next year, was reported for the costs that continued to grow in the system's problems.
According to the report of the Army Sportsman, Dee Zhait, the launch of the launch in Berden Voltenberg, Linland Faltz, was extended to half of 2019 years ago.
The ship was planned to be introduced in 2014, but the problem was continued after the income, and the wild plan was to be greatly crazy.
In 2007, four of the mariners of Barden Voltenberg Frigate are used in the army instead of the age of the bremen Frigate ship.
Barden Voltenberg Frigate is also a part of the stars technology, which are attached to powerful canon, air mixtures and ship mixers, as well as low-rayers, redline signals, and sound signals.
As other important characteristics, the maintenance cycles can be made long, and it is possible to send a freegate ship for the less than two years.
However, the Dee Zhait reports that the plan continues to be late, that Germany should take a major role in order to show military forces to the country, that it would be a timely late when it is actually used.
The F125 Fligate ship was a great news when the German Season rejected the motion in the last year and returned to Hamburg's Broom Unt Foss.
This was the first time when the marine soldiers returned the ship to the ship company after they arrived.
The details of the reason of the recurrence background are not known, but German media quotes several informations that the military ships have been seen as a serious "software and structural deficit" which has been incompatible with the war mission.
Berden Voltenberg Frigate is the half of the people who needed the first generation of the Bremen class, and it has been carried out by about 120 marine soldiers, because the software missing has a significant influence.
And Berden Voltenberg Frigate is very severe because the ships are low-down, and the sea soldiers will be limited to upgrade to future.
The weight of this 7.000 tons of lineland Faltz is two times the same ships used in the Second World War.
In addition to structural deficits, the total costs of the projects included training.
The total costs of the project have been increased from the first 22 memory Euro to 31 memory (36 dollars).
Recently, it has been warned that the forces of Germany are weak, and the issues of the new fresh ship are very important.
After entering this year, Hans Peter Bartells Defence Commissioner of the German Conference recognizes that the Sea Army actually misses the ships that are prepared for Capacity.
The Communist stated that there is no military ship instead of using an old army, that the problem increases severely with time.
The Communicator also showed that Barden Voltenberg Frigate was not leading to the Sea Army.
The National Trast, the mystery of the Cowmore.
In the new study in the high-term area of Scotland, it means how cowmori uses the ground when captures.
The same study has brought new information on the actions of this uniform wood, and hoped to contribute to the future protection activities.
In this study, researchers in the National Trast For Scotland, are followed by general cowmorery, sopranopistrol, browning yards and Doventon in Westeros Inverte Gardens.
Place a recorder on the main points in the field and follow activity of cowmori through the season.
The NHS employees and volunteers are working on mobile detectives.
All recorded sounds are analyzed by experts and added to the frequency of calling cowmori, and shows what kind of things are doing.
On the basis of analysis, the field maps and reports are produced, and the actions of cowmori will be detailed to the ground.
The NTS's natural protection adviser expects that the most important lives are in Cowmore, and that the study of how their lives were used by some kinds of species.
This information helps us to decide the Military of Life Management Services to make life facilities and forest protection for the coomory and related species.
In the entire Scotland and the British area, the number of cowmori lives decreased in the past 100 years.
Cowmori is a crisis of losses by construction industry and reduction of living areas that affect tree situations.
It's a risk for the insected papers, the chemical processes, the attacks from the cats, the wind and the lights are risked for coomory.
Actually, the cowmory is not blind.
But the cowmori is the nightmare, and it is more dependent on the hearing of the visions.
Cowmori uses the respiratory capacity, gets insects in points, and recognizes the disagreements of a fly route.
Historical architecture 270, an important garden 38, the NTS that manages more than 76,000 hectares in the country are very serious to cowmore.
The NTS provides regularly research, checking the woods of cowmore, and sometimes ten experts who protect cowmorely or protect cowmore.
NTS also established a safe zone in the Scotland, and the entire 10 types of cowmolies in Scotland are raised in the same place.
Mr. David Thompson, to manage the east, is a ideal environment for Cowmore.
"This Sleve is the best place for Cowmore."
"It's an old building here, and there's a lot of old trees, and all of them are part of the lives applied to the cowmore.
But there's a lot of things that you don't know yet, and you can help you to understand what you need to grow cowmory.
When the cowmori has been destroyed, one of the trees who are grown up, he has been killed at least 400 young cowmores and may have been able to destroy the cowmory of the land, because it is important to confirm cowmory before he works in the ground.
Cowmori is designed to protect animals, killing, violation, interacting, and crazy trees.
Elizabeth Ferrel, who serves the Scotland Committee of Cowmore Protection Trast, requests support from people in the regions.
"I don't know what you want to do about the cowmores of Scotland, and I don't really know what you want to do."

A few hundreds of migrants' children in secret to the tent of the Texas border camp.
The number of transients of a month had no comparative change but the children of the migrants who were arrested have increased, and this is why some of them were difficult to trust the child's safeguard.
At this time, most of the guaranteers were incoming migrants, and they were afraid to make a child's request to risk their own residence.
The federal authorities have to be guaranteed in June and the other members of their generation needed to submit prints, and the data were stated that they were shared with the migrant authorities, and that risk was higher.

The black man again?
Tell me to a married couple after the text of New York's baby officers.
The baby officer in New York tells her marriage as it was differently dismissed, and her mother sent her error, "and the black man came."
The marriage decreed that the case was "forgiving" and that it was a racist different.
Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of the two children, showed that the new baby officer Jezel Morris was a black man when he arrived at the first time of the labour in 2016.
"Now or black man" and Plasco Flashman sent his husband a text.
But the text was not a husband, but he sent to Mr. Morris twice.
The New York Post says, "Plasco-Flaxman, who left the past African American baby officers, expected Philippines, instead of waiting for the job.
Mr. Morris got a day payment, and he returned to her home in Uber.
This time Morris told his wife as a payment, and if he worked in the first date, he asks 350 dollars, six months of payment.
"I want to tell them, I don't have to do this," she said to the post on Friday. "I know that this is a differences."
She denied the conviction that she was a racist, and that after she had made an unfortunate thought to Mrs. Morris, she was untrusted, because she was untrusted to her, and the excuse was just.
"The woman sent her a text, but it doesn't mean that.
She's not a racist.
We're not a racial discretionist," his husband Joel Prasco said to the post.
"But if you were wrong, can you give your child to the one you've been disappointed?
What about your born baby?
I can't.
So, as you're looking for the case, Plasco said, she was a very difficult situation for a few weeks ago, and she was a very difficult situation.
"You're going to do this to people of such difficult circumstances?"
It's not so good.
In the same way, the law case has progressed, the court's threat has grown quickly, and the marriage in social media has been disappointed, and their action and logology have been busy.

And now I know about Paddington is a great success.

She added Paddington's "their very important family members" that his father felt quietly for his final success.

FBI, the future of Bret Cabano is not expected by the start of the investigation.
"In a limited time and range investigation, if we can handle something like he really wanted, we could be able to end a little bit.

They're all the timeing problem.
In the middle elections on the sixth November before, and, according to the expectation of the Republic party, they would be very deceived by the elections of the people who wanted to choose the Supreme Court of the United States.
George W. Bush called the Senator to the next ones and pressed his wife Ashley to support his wife Ashley, who served Mr. Cabano, who served the Bush in White House.

Decrease in the northern Korean residents under the rights of Kim.
For seven years ago, Kim John was maintained the right, and the number of North Korean deads was reduced, and the Korean lawer said.
Pak Bionseg, quoted data from the Korean Department, said, compared the number of 2706 fugitives in 2011, and last year was 1,127.
Mr. Pack said that a high-term rate from the north Korea and China's stronger border management and incoming migrants is the principal cause.
Pionyan hasn't expressed public comments.
Many of the emigrants from the north are then offered by citizens in Korea.
Soul says that after the war of war in 1953, more than 30,000 north Koreans are over the border of illegality.
Most of them have the northern Korea and the largest border, and fled through China, which is easily more than the borders that are protected by the northern Korea (DMZ), which are increasingly protected by the northern Korea.
China's no more legal migrants than the dead is the refuge.
In fact, the relationship of the north and the south in the war is still improved in this few months.
On the head of this month, I met in Pionyan for the discussion on the two leaders of the two countries who stopped the non-new negotiations.

Nancy Perosy said to Bret Cabano, "Hesteric"'s office of the Supreme Court of Justice.
In the Minipartment, Nancy Perosy called Bret Cabano's Supreme Court of Justice "histélica" and his ability was inadequate to the fulfillment in the Supreme Court.
Perosis commented on the interview in Texas Tribyer Festibal, opened in Austin in Texas.
"It's not possible to think that if a woman has been taking such a situation," hissteric would be expressed.
Cabano rejected Dr. Christine Breathe Ford, emotionally denied the proposal that both of them had done a sexual violation for the teenager.
While his initial statement, Cabano was very emotically, and his family and high school discussions were struggling and fulfilled the words.
He also called the Democratic Democratics of the Commission clearly, and on proposing to himself, he called the Liberal Destruction of the Countries, who had been struggled in the election of Hirry Clinton in 2016.
Perosis said that by Cabano's witness, he was sure that he couldn't follow the Supreme Court because he had a democracy.
"He thinks he's incorrect to the manner against these statements and Clinton and the Democratic Party."
Pharosis showed a difficult color when Cabano was accepted and asked whether the Democratic Democratics had received a half of the United Nations.
"If he's not telling the truth to the Parliament or the FBI, it's not only the Supreme Court, but also in the court that is now.
Cabano is now the judge of the Supreme Court of D.C.
Perosis is a democracy, who thinks he's a protective judge, and she's worried that Cabano can rule Cabano on medical security laws and on Rowway cases.
In his approved audience, Cabano refused to ask whether he wanted to take a certain Supreme Court's judgment.
"It's not a wonderful step to say, "I'm not going to a person who's predicted in hissterical."

And she continued, and she said, "I've been helping a woman in an Egektib, and she was weeping when she felt angry, but when she felt angry, she started developing the technology and talking to me, "I think I'm threatened.
I'm angry.
And she's just going to cry.
And I thought it was great. "
The swords are not understood, and some of the wrath are recognized as a wrath.
In ancient job, there was one of the famous memorys in the office of a man's office, and when I had fled with a grievous wrath that I didn't say, he had a little fearful woman of the cold manager, who had been cut off the heads of the heads of the board.

They don't know you're angry.
