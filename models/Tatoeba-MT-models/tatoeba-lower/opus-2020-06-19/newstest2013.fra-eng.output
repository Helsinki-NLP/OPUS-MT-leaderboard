A Republican Strategy to contrary Obama's Research
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight the electoral fraud.
However, the Centre Brennan considers this last as a mythe, confirming that the electoral fraud is more weird in the United States than the number of people killed by the fuel.
Furthermore, the Republican lawyers have recognised only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will be negatively affected by participation.
In this regard, these measures will be in part the American democratic system.
In contrast to Canada, the United States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments promoted new laws from 2009 to make more difficult for the inscription or vote process.
This phenomenon took the broadcast after the elections of November 2010 which had been added to 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
Thus, 180 draft laws that restricted the exercise of vote law in 41 States were introduced during the only year of 2011.
The new electoral laws require that electronics provide an identity map with photograph and an American citizenship evidence.
Furthermore, these laws also reduce the vote periods by anticipation, the right to inscrease as a electorer the day of the scrutin and retreat the citizens with a judiciary record of their vote right.
Before the elections of 2006, no American States required electorers to present a photographed identity map.
Indiana was the first State to put such requirements.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirms the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republic authorities were encouraged to expand this practice to other States.
During the past two years, they were a law project in 34 States to strengthen the electorers to present an identity map with photography.
It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec, the American citizens have no universe identity map like the card of disease security.
In fact, 11% of the American citizens, or 21 million people in age to vote, have no identity cards with photos issued by a Government Agency of their State.
Furthermore, five million new electorers in 2012 do not have such identity part.
However, it costs often more than hundred dollars to get the required identity map.
New restrictions affect young people, minorities, and lower income persons.
In fact, 25% of Africans, 15% of people won less than 35,000 dollars; 18% of the citizens of over 65 years and 20% of the electorers of 18 to 29 years does not have the required identity map with photograph.
Better.
Students, electors considered more voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity map with photographed by their institution.
In contrast, these same States allow the members of fisheries or chass clubs that vote more from the Republic side to use to vote the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004 there was no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such requirements.
Since 2011, a twelve States have adopted laws required electorers to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly limited to Spanish vote.
However, it says that two Spanish electorers on three favorite the democratic party.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators have advised in 2011 laws that enable the inscription of electorers in the day of scrutin in eight States.
Furthermore, they have limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to the electorers who want to enter into.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the general election of 2004, electoral inscription campaigns contributed to record about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have broken 17% of the inscription of new electorors in 2010 in relation to 2006.
Moreover, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other States to reduce the vote period by anticipation.
For example, in the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of the electorers who voted by anticipation were Africans, while these lasts represented only 13% of the electors of the State.
He also went to the Spanish.
These are only 11% of the electorers, but 24% of citizens who voted by anticipation.
In contrast, 76% of the electorers represented only 46% of the electorers voting by anticipation.
The Democratic legislators and their supporters have been courageously opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the inscription of electors.
Many law projects have been blocked by the democratic governments.
The Agency General of the United States has been intervened to suspend the most controversy laws.
They could be limited in part of the disasters.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have adopted laws required the presentation of an identity map with photography.
However, the new rules in place will independently make the exercise of vote law in 2012.
Democratic critics declare the partial character of the laws that have been voted and they see a clear goal to influence the results in 2012 in key States.
A report of the Brendan Centre of 2011 shows that the States adopted these laws represent 171 of 270 votes necessary to the electoral colleague to submit the Presidency.
It is too early to make sure that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have significant effects on the result of the presidency elections of 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will be negatively affected by participation.
In this regard, these measures will be in part the American democratic system.
Depth of the prostate cancer: go to test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present wrong results, with false negative results or false positives, which include inutile medical interventions.
What to do even more of those who have already been restricted to travel disappointment tests.
Do you want to pass test or not?
We asked the advice of two specialists.
In the studys carried out in the United States, there were many pollution between witness groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have closed recommendations.
Another study, the European, has concluded a difference of death between patients who have received a disappointment and those who have not occurred.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that we have 30 and 40% more chances to have metastases if we are not depited.
So I recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years, if we have a direct parent that has already had a prostate cancer.
African originmen are also more risks.
The key is to take the good decision once we detected a cancer.
There are agressive cancers and others who are indolent.
The patient really needs to understand the risk level of his cancer, offering the possible options, unless the cancers of the prostate are not required for long-term life, and at least, in these cases, for an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many people in the house that are detecting a cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not agressive and doesn't worry their life.
We will suggest them to make the active monitoring and if the disease progresses, we will offer them a treatment.
Furthermore, the criteria is determined to decide who should or not be treated.
So I recommend even to go through the test.
But it is important to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether we should go over or not.
In collaboration with the International Urologist Society, Movember created a tool that allows the evaluation of the APS tests.

Prevent Disease
There is no wonderful recette to prevent the cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adoption of good life habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering.
We estimate that if everyone eat well and moved enough, we could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If nobody had fumished, this tax would throw at least 50%," sublines André Beaulieu, Port-word of the Cancer Society.
In contrast, we assess that about 10% of cancers are caused by heritage.
Many remains totally unexplied.
For the Canadian Society of Cancer, the fight against the tabaguisme remains a priority, although the reduction of the number of fumers.
The cigarette is linked to 85% of the case of cancer of pulmon.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This night is great to the health of people.
"Today, there are 1,5 million fumers in Quebec," deployed the door-word André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the disappearance of the cigarette, the risk of death of a cancer is half-shot.
The Peeds
The embounting point and obedience also favorises the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They will increase the risks of cancer, cool and rectification, oesophage, pancreas and the outer.
"The research shows that the regular practice of physical activities during a whole life protected against the cancer of the cylon," adds.
Food
The body recommends also to limit its consumption of red flesh.
In too large quantity, she makes the risks to be achieved from a coloric cancer.
The characteristics also, and they should be exhausted.
Conservation of flesh by fumish, shopping or salation can lead to the training of carcine substances.
"There are recently able to argue the body cells and to develop the cancer," explains.
Vitamines
During the last years, several scientists studied links between vitaminal extensions and cancer.
However, their research is not concluded for now.
Studies on vitamine E are contradicts, according to the SCC.
While one of them constitutes a reduction of the risks of cancer of prostate, another note is more increased.
The effect of vitamine D on the cancer is not clearly established.
Furthermore, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about her concerns and his family ancients with his doctor.
"Pashing a depth test, it doesn't give the cancer."
The decorated Higgs bowl
The announcement of the probable discovery of Higgs' box has created all the emotions, the last, and for reason.
We actually believe that this boss participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, nothing but that.
And then, it is the last particular which existence is predicted by the standard model - our best, or "better" explaining the nature and the behavior of the matter - but who has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicians, it's still not completely sure he's doing well with Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have an authentic new particular, and that it seems much like the Higgs box predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, new data devoted this week in a great physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm it, but there is still no data to be perfectly certain.
Let's even imagine that he's done well with Higgs, because the chances of trembling looks like small, and let's see what's going on.
There is, in this low world, a law fatally unconsiderable that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to cut this rule - and don't try too strong, you're gonna do bad.
But even if the physical of the particulars is a very strange world, it also has a law of this type: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stimulates that two particules can not obtain the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quality" state - this "state" consists of a large way in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicians classify the particulars in two categories.
In a coin, we find good citizens called fermions, who obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other way, the bowls are a sale band of anarchists who do not respect for nothing - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can be beautiful and well find themselves in the same place, at the same time.
The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratorys, then divided in two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary), The Particle Adventure, the Berkeley Laboratorys: the assessments, which we don't come here, and the "particules of force", through which the great forces of nature propagate and in which the Higgs bows would be in some way appeared.
These bottles, we need to subline it here, not all animals are so exotic as we could believe it.
In fact, if you are going to read this chronic, it is thanks to a box of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "party of light" that is the "message" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, an electromagnetic load is accurate or changed direction, it's "derange" the electrical field in this specific place, a little as a caillou launched in an angle.
This "dependence" is born an electromagnetic area (with light, or infrarouge, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this place is nothing other than one photon - and then one of the "power porters".
Fast Box
It's also going to be with the Higgs' bowl, in this difference nearby that it's another field, the Higgs' field, which must be "degraded" to show this box.
But this field of Higgs is much more stabil than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it needs to get very high, very high energy, a little as if it was a green angle, which only a very big rock could rise on the surface.
That is why there is a great accelerator of particulars such as the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is an annual of 27 km of circumference! - to achieve such energy.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the report between Higgs and mass.
They are not all particulars, nor all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the lovers, do it, but others, not - a cup of paper, for example, will never hold himself on a cold.
And in the same way, it is not all the particulars that interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while others (come the photon) do not have it.
Now, what is that "possible to bring" all these researchs, ask Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this is to check the validity of the standard model (MS), and it also allows physicians to explore all excessively between observations and predictions of the MS.
They are also many to desire to find it hardly, because the monarch difference could open a door on a "physical new" and roll some rolls in the model.
This must be said, there are still great charities, not suggesting any explanation for the gravity (or) or the dark matter, which forms about 80% of the Universal matter (re-ops!).
But we haven't found such challenges in the CERN until now.
Repercussions
The impact of these researchs in the day of Mrs. and Ms. Every Monte, they are more difficult to prevent, but we would have failed to imagine that there is no existence.
Take care: At the beginning of the 60s, the laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratorys were not suffering the revolution that their work would declare.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing left.
In fact, we have already said the physician Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and he himself set up the first laser constant (the first were pulled), in 1962 -, the laser's department was immediately seen as a "labo gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also prove from all the instructions around research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle set a small light capteur in 1969 during his optic work.
This capteur, although it wasn't all his original intention, served now "eye" to all the digital photo devices of the world, and he valued the Physical Nobel 2009.
This doesn't mean that the LHC activities will be necessary to transform our lives, but that means that, really, we never know...
The best way to die...
With its Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must be reached soon when a law project is prepared.
But in this essential area, many remains to do.
The Deviation tried to look at it closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still alone in his apartment of Monteregie.
The cancer of the prostate that ringed him had left a two-year-old time.
"They had given me five years to live, I had seven years ago," he said, half-raisin, length in his bed in the house of the palliative guards Victor-Gadbois, from Beloeil, where the wheel came.
"But it's still a choc, we can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease makes its work: a lot of lowness that refuses to make it alone to the toilets, and even to eat alone.
Attorney before a dinner, he accepts to help, resigned.
Courage, he even comes to sleep, talking to the unknowns who are about him, bringing her medicines, offering him a bain.
The strength of normal death.
"My biggest wish, it's that we're healthing me from the diarrhee, it's humble," he trusted.
A few hours later, the team found a remedie to this bad.
"In our life, we learn that a man, it's standing," says Peter Brodeur, psychologist in Victor-Gadbois's house.
Regressing to the child's stage, for some people, is an inacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the capacity of the person's " to accept the regression, it is stated.
Because, in the opinion of many people who act in palliative care, great moments are declined in the heart even of this rebellion.
Patients who enter the palliative care house of Victor-Gadbois suffer all of the cancer.
They have a prognosis of life at maximum of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurse team that around them doesn't provide any more of the " medical care " .
For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "conscious and explored."
But the disease discovered me my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no longer desire in life," she said, before accepting that we have a mask to help him respira.
She expected the same time, in the next days, a last visit of her son came from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, we are offered, with a group of beneficiaries, the care of the body and the help of food.
That's the palliative care, that's what we're going to do when there's nothing else to do.
To make the more comfortable death.
In Quebec, there is a palliative bed for 11 700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know that we're all finished by dieing a day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains the Dre Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
That is at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual consolidation.
At the death, it will be accepted to prodigate mouths to brandy or Pepsi, according to the request.
Diabetics will not be able to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the day.
Yesterday, we served a beer to Mr. X, deceived during the night.
Tomorrow, he's his son who's gonna finish the beer at the feet of the defense.
"We are helping the neighbors as the patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of the care.
In the house of Victor-Gadbois, the days follow, but they don't look like it.
At the side of a 93-year old man who save his last family assembly in the court, well calm in his ears, while we were cutting in his honor, a young man of 36 years died tragically, around his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying to survive.
"After six months, there are always three to five beds that are occupied by officers of less than 45 years, "through the Dre Christiane Martel is worried.
53% of the patients who are admitted at Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Access problem to palliative care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians have not only access to palliative cares, it is to be designed to perform patience when a disease has come to the terminal phase of their life, which is home, hospital or hospital.
And several organisms, such as the house of Victor-Gadbois and the Palliative Assembly of the Grand Montreal, are specialized more or less exceptionally in the cares offered to the cancers.
It is precisely this great carence in the health cares of Chebekois who makes fear for several specialized doctors in palliative cares the adoption of a law covering the Utahania and the suicide assistance.
Since the month of October, a manifest signed from the summits of the palliative cares, including Dr. Balfour Mountain and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulated to witness their opposition to such initiatives.
According to the Dr. Christian Martel, the health system whobecois is not sufficient to ensure that everyone will have the right to palliative quality care before it is accepted to proceed to the Euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient over 14 days at the urgency, in great pain, without doing the need to suffer it.
I'm afraid that patients don't want to die because they don't get the right concerns.
And parallelly, several oncologues are achieved on their patients until the last day, unless the worst prognoses.
The hopes of Helena Richard's survival were already minimized when she left an experimental chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologue that I stopped the treatment, she answered me she told me to stop me fighting, she told me.
But she told me I'd be done!
No powerful care
Three Martel believes that 90% of the diseases who want to die thank those who have not accepted their request after they have been suffered from their pain by a palliant care team.
But it is necessary to say that palliative cares are not absolutely powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the director of palliative care to the Great Montreal Housing Society, the patients would be refractal to the treatment against pain in 8% of the cases.
At the end of the life, the doctors then have sometimes reviewed the palliative sedition, who are back to sleep the patient until their death, or sportly, or permanently.
We can't do anymore as if we don't hear this part of suffering.
Moreover, the unsubordinated disease will have the possibility to have this palliative sedition.
The diseases that are not suffered always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't mean necessary, "I want you to be able to have me ", that means "I want to be cut off."
The implementation of this report was possible through a journalism bourse of the Canadian Health Research Institutes.
Immobilier squads of large broadcast in Quebec
Officers of the tour, BTP companies, collectors of political and specialist parts of the Italian mafia, tell the day after what they know about a formidable "system", the industrie of building, workers, politicians, syndicalists and mafioso.
A " industry " which costs a lot of good contributions, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious as the system is exhausted since the great ways were taken," Ironis Jacques Duchesneau, deputy of Quebec and the old police captain of Montreal.
It is by him that the scandal was exclaimed in 2011 by a fund investigation on the malvery related to the contracts of road work in Quebec, where the first Liberal Ministry of the Time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to turn.
The "Report Duchesneau" established a direct link between the industry, the hidden financing of parties and the corruption of officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, the only Minister of Transport would have distributed a billion of dollars on contracts," some reviewing their instincts to touch a quote party!
The Charbonneau Commission "he has already fallen two rooms," adds, hoped that it will be "demoting the strategy behind the individuals."
A permanent anticorruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anticorruption Unit, established in 2011, also accompanied with its control army, investigators and analysis of the government.
More of the cops of "Marteau hearing" who, since 2009, would lead the "Cartel of Egouts" of Montreal to put the double pedal on the contract fronts...
The last weeks, she processed serious investigations and brought accusations for fraud and corruption against municipal elections, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, master of a bank town.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who came to demission from the Laval More, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that it has been attached to repeat for public contracts.
They are formally accused by other engineers in Montreal's viries and Italian origin companies, including Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito.
This has made sense by explaining the mechanical committee of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself delivered 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary intermediary to the Mafia that turned the money to the Montreal Union, the part of the Master General Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito seed all winds in 2000, given more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (aproximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals then to the power.
He also would have organized an illegal collection of funds for the first Liberal Ministry, Nathalie Normandeau.
Cost contracts involving costs
In Montreal, the corruption system worked around.
Gilles Surprising, ex-enginerator in public works, has made it well details before the Commission: in ten years he received challenges building businesses, invitations to travel, golf tours, restaurants, hokey matchs and pots-vin, with a totalising 736,000 dollars, in the switch of the costs.
Other officers of the tour have been advertised if they have been cutting the pattern of 30% to 40% of the factures, by extra failure.
Finally, Martin Dumont was accused by Mr. Tremblay to have closed the eyes on a parallel budget that feeds his cups with salt money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay demissioned first November, plongeing Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elections of Montreal to shoot the alarm sound.
Mair of Riviere-des-Prairies, on the east of the island, she was surprised from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land, purchased 5 million dollars and invested... 1,6 million for promotors, full of immobiliar boom.
70% of money in the electoral campaigns
The investigation that will finally be placed, she says that she's "goat on a round that allows to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by fires, to stop the gangrene and to spend the sins."
The process, she said, is "dough but positive."
We are trying to clean up the plague, but it would need a proper research unit in Montreal and a veil, to not see the doubtful practices.
Like we're doing the minage.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes his side that "the officials have robbed hundreds of million dollars," but especially concerns the role of "eleus at the current strategy," when they didn't throw up into the maguille!
By estimating 70% of the money in the financing of the electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironized, "We told me that it was just a reflection of reality."
The Government proposes to limit the donations to the parties to 100 dollars, but it will not change the woman, according to him: "When the electoral expenditures are not strictly limited, there will be the money in the policy."
He proposes a complete revision of the public contracts and funding of the parties: "We can't go low; go to the ground of things, with courage, to rebuild the house on stronger bases, with more control and law."
If this story declines the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who are going to look at their own court...
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This saison, you've taken a new envergury with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It may be explained by a single conscience, but also by the new size of the PSG.
Great games have arrived.
Every day, I'm progressing at their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
At the day, these elements can be able to history my game level.
And, in match, it's easier.
It's very quick in the foot.
But I don't worry about it.
From my beginning in the Clairefontain INF Preformation Centre to my pass to Saint-Etienne, I always advanced by pallars.
So you will benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recruits of this were used to discuss very high-level matches.
They also know that each training is crucial.
What makes a player like me to make face and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He's packed by additives like Claude Makelele, who played at the same place as I.
Ancelotti is the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect to all the technicians.
Today, there is no equality in Ligue 1 and is part of the best European trainers.
He has a great experience, and he won a lot of tits with hot clubs.
He's got great games.
I think he'll bring other tickets to Paris.
In January, I had a comfortable discussion with him.
I went out of a series of wounds.
The confidence he agrees to me also explain my performances.
What looks you take on the first part of the PSG saison?
Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of leader.
But we're staying in embuscade.
One of our major objectives is the Like of Campions: we are qualified for the end 8s with the way.
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
We're going to try to go away.
Then it can happen.
But we will have our word to say to very good European teams.
We want to first end our ball first, before Porto, to get back at the 8th end.
Can the PSG become a large European short-term club?
He already has the budget...
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to bring titles and enter into the period.
Today, this isn't the case.
Financially, the PSG provides the ways to concrete this project.
In Ligue 1, don't wear the title, like the last saison, would it be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a great deception.
This year, we really have a heart to take this champion title.
The last saison, we haven't passed away.
In May, there was a deception because we had qualities to finish first.
We made a very big saison.
We've finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are census to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made a more fantastic saison.
This year, I think it's the good thing.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have weapons to bring it.
Are you sure the media are waiting for too much of the PSG?
It's normal that we're waiting for many of us to see what was invested and the players we have.
We accept it completely.
After that, when we win 4-0 home against Troyes, and we still find things to be near us, it's sure it's a little frustrating.
We're asking what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 all weekends.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to put a game project.
A team was built with time.
We proved in the Ligue of campions that we could answer here.
Look at Manchester City who doesn't arrive, from two inches, to qualify for the 8 end, they also have done great expenditures!
In view of our investment, we imagined you with 15 points forward to the dream!
It was neglecting our adversaries and the campaign of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the last saison, were "bound" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is passive.
I hope that in May, we can have the smile by say that, although all the difficulties, we're done by exporting it.
The PSG seems totally depending on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's better than we say there's a "Zlatan dependence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very performing and that he makes a lot of goals.
He came for this and proved that he's the star of the Ligue 1.
He showed out everywhere where he passed, he was a big player, a world star.
In the middle of the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men around him.
What he did is really exclusive.
This takes others to history their game level.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders of the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live in Euro 2012 with France team?
Like a deception.
I had a heart to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my worm stopped me to play the time of the game.
I've seen things there, and I've been strengthened.
Today, I'm going to realize good matches in choice.
That's what I hoped from my baptized with the Blues.
We took the lectures of what happened in Ukraine, and we have to have an exemplary behavior today.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Dischamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the quality group for the Mondial.
The selector is rigorous, near the players, and inspires the wine.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparison.
White had achieved its objective by qualifying us for Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Bleus to Brazil.
The good zero (1-1) arranged on October 16, is it a founder?
This match gave us trust.
Everybody was struck for everyone.
Before this choice in Spain, I never lived like match in my carrier.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All the contrary of current monetary changes based on central banks, identified transactions and treatment costs.
Furthermore, as often in these technologies, a political vision is handled: the conviction that the current monetary system, makes bank monopoles, leads to financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonyme), is at times a virtual monetary (maybe convertable in dollars, euros...) and a safe change protocol that allows the change of pair files to pay.
Over 200 000 transactions have already been recorded by 15 000 computers on the network.
A small thousand web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as payment means.
The currency of the bitcoin, after a total of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, was cut to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning around a tenth dollar (the courses are reviewed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing of very impressive, compared to global changes in real monetary or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been interested in a report on the virtual monnaries published in October.
She describes bitcoin as "the virtual monety with most success," "in competence with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional monetary".
Bitcoin is different from other virtual monetary types such as "credits" used to progress in a video game that is winning by playing or that can be buyed (and sometimes switch back).
The Facebook social network also developed this kind of system.
However, every time, a central authority controls and treats changes.
With Bitcoin, all the network nuts are at the depositary time of the account book, checkers, monetary emitteurs, and buyers and solds.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, ensure that anonymate is so.
A total of information related to this transaction is signed electronicly by a double key encryption system.
The network can so check the authentication of transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the scanned bitcoins exist well in the public account book, distributed in all networks.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical deficit launched to computers, and the winner, a kind of providing central bank, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a file hacking phase, it is to be converted by a large file in a shorter and unique number.
The computers "to take" the new transaction and add a number before "hash" the whole.
The objective is to find the number that gives a particular threat (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other neighbors guess that it's the best.
The transaction is then indestructively linked to the string of all other transactions; any change would change the undertakings.
If a user wanted to pay twice with the same very quick money (minute 10 minutes), one of the two transactions would be valid by the network - the other remaining orpheline because both have different pressures.
The computer resolved the deficit is 50 bitcoins.
In order to disappear inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
So the number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divided to 100 million, which leaves the margin...
The difficulty of deficit is also higher than every increase of calculation power.
The network's life has already been high and low.
Web sites for Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins in flying deposits.
"The used failure does not affect the protocol itself," ensures Pierre Noizat, who comes from launching Paymium, a real payment company using Bitcoin network.
The ECB also makes the possibilities of money whiteing through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this fall.
Peace factors such as Wikipedia refuses the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analysed the account book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins does not run.
In November, the "general solds" were launched.
"Twenty thousand dollars have been switched," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a pedagogic book on this monkey, believes much in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paythonia, is equal to a credit card (in real monetary) or a payment per mobile without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which return as less precious.
The portor is more of his identity and so it may be anonymous.
The system is easy to work in markets, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to communicate a address that a phone can "photographer and recognize", notices Peter Noizat, which ensures that there are thousands of users.
There is a general movement of delivery due to herarchical systems for the most horizontal systems.
"There's time for Bitcoin's impression, but 2013 could be a tourner," he predicted.
In its report, the ECB proposes to review the various risks, today considered as high, in case of the success of this monetary.
We're gone from Afganistan.
And then?
The French teams left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
Otan and the Americans should follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the African Army takes the possession of its territory and that the Afghhanians choose their future, without any expectation of us.
These are especially the African countries that we punished them in consideration as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutiled.
The Talibans compose foreign extremists, ancient rulers in Pakistan, but often countries who refuse foreign army presence, such as the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, old and architectures, even if they were joined by Jihadists, Pakistans, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tadjiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assistance by local insurances, these will not be anymore when the West will become more discreet.
The department of the French teams from Nijrab's base, which I observed from the top of the planted collines of amndiers through French credits, was made in the order.
Camions and blind convictions joined Kaboul without being attacked, surrounded by helicopters.
There will be no taliban deference in Kaboul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed from their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kaboul was then empty, the fire and blood country of the fact of the ends between various factions.
Their control of the country was then performed as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghanians have paid the price of the obscurance of these countries over the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved our days.
Ancient mudjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban are joined in the desire of keeping women in a lower position.
The main notables of antisoviet war were returned to the power in 2001.
They moved in businessists, entering Government grounds to build them in lands to build to the Iran and Pakistan revenge refugees, which benefit from large American subtraction contracts.
They are deceived; most of them do not fight themselves.
People, as I heard it in campaigns, inspired to a government that is not constituted by flyers.
Many young people want to go, as they will share those who have benefited American widows: the escape of capitals is significant.
Youths are fatigued by war and its ideals.
They have bought the modern world during their exils in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
At least 65% of the population is less than 25 years; Kaboul is now 5 million d'habitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full, girls like boys.
It will be necessary to provide work to those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurance of older parties or to corrupt certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fridge of portable phones; TV, and its tourists who present a modern world are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will lead to the commander be considered as laws?
Ancient leaders of antisovietic battle are already concerned to reconstitute provincial millions, which will escape from the central power.
Afghanistan, mountain countries, to strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation, to the image of the western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised State, to strong presidential power, to remove the position of the Prime Minister that exists from the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, in particular the opportunity of the elections provided in April 2014.
But his country is, since the 50 years and already before, depending on foreign aid.
No industry has been carried out on the road, no barrier is in state, no significant irrigation system has been prepared.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and fruits.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a thirty years of war, a government control on infrastructure would be necessary.
The dream was exhausted that Afghanistan had great mining riches.
This just added to the feeling that westerns were just there to get it.
Without energy to treat the mineral of ferry or cooking on the place, nor transport means to export it through the mountains, there is no mineral exploitation.
The Chineses have almost left my Aynak's cooper min, allowing international architectures (financing by the World Bank) to promote the large buddhic site and remain the most important employees in the province.
It will also be necessary for a day that Africa and Pakistan, which depend on imports and exports, will be restored of normal reports.
The department of French fighting teams was finished on 20 November.
The new cooperation Treaty provides the continuation of traditional assistance: girls, boys, French department to university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, supporting the Archeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "gain hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task to consist of offences and actions, a service of " civil- military action" of the Ministry of Defence (Chimic), which was deleted in 2012, has been carried out by a small French NGO, many collective interests and agricultural rehabilitation actions in tens of mountain villages.
These works, gourmands in main-d" local work, helped to contain the insurrection: irrigation, pockets, potable water, rebounding, fruitful trees, protection of soldiers and increased cultural surfaces.
What will we leave as a reminder, after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget would contribute to improve local life conditions, very hard in these valleys often more than 20,000 meters of high.
The campaign received decades of written requests of small agricultural realizations exchanged from local communities of the provincies of Capisa.
In order to deliver them from the insurance taken by strangers, what the agricultors said to me to want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civil assistance, well-controlled and directly touching them.
A Constitution for Forces in Egypt
It's a new copy of poker from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives the full powers, he decided to play his way.
When he took all the courts, he announced, mercredi, that the constituent Assembly would vote his final text on the next day.
It was just a week ago, the chief of the State had given to this Assembly additional two months to finish his work.
This is about two years that Egypt supports a provisional text, several times amended that the institutional stability fragilizes and leads to juridical immoralities.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opposers, the President continues in his "autocratic deliver", continues to "treat his word" and "peet the right."
On the side of its parties, it is a way to quickly end with the institutional and political crisis, accrediting the transition process.
A reference should be organized in the 15 days.
A very short time length that encourages Brothers to renew their project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to find a popular and democratic legislation while the contemporary is worthy of all the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorablely, as he told it in an interview to the American Hebdomadaire Time.
Since this review to a precipite vote has the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "If you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers," these must have finished after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange ambition that 85 members of this constituting Assembly, in large islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most of the liberals missed the call.
On November, little before the constitutional declaration, they locked the door, estimating that they could not assess their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to be achieved, 11 members, replaced members, were added to the chair yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
Without surprise, it is most often the unanimity that articles have been voted.
The comments were also amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day would be expressed around the time of prayer, some members of the Committee considering that the penalty of the constituent was wrongly regulated.
The text, which was still in training to be voted yesterday, was 234 articles.
The objectives of all attention, Article 2 remains finally identical to the Constitution of 1971, establishing that "the principles of the charian are the main source of the law."
The salafistic parties, for which the establishment of the Islamic law is a major revendication, hoped to replace "the principles" by "the rules", which would have allowed a more stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and their respect for the other composers of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," answers the liberals, which see only a couple of communications.
Because, according to them, the islamism of the Constitution is made through other articles.
They are in particular in Article 220, which trusts the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular for the compliance of the laws with the chair.
According to the specialist of the Egyptian Sophie Pommier, it is concerned because "the people called to speak are not chosen and have no democratic legislation.
We can see the principles of a teocracy."
Furthermore, the fears of the liberals are attracted by the fact that the next rector of this university should be less moderate than the current.
"For the time there is no concrete religious influence.
With this Constitution, we remain in the framework of the civil state.
Most jurisdictions that work on this text are not olem but university, for some formed in the French system, Alexis Blouet, which prepares a thèse on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that it may have an ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms of employed are involved in the religious vocabulary.
There are references to the "fiqh" particularly [islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question may be in the future to know how civil judges are competent to speak over."
In addition to its religious aspect, the voted text yesterday is very criticised because of the extensive powers he gives the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers assume that these are very reduced in comparison with what they were under the old regime.
Moreover, the powers confined to the Army.
In accordance with the will of military, the exam of the Defence budget will not be submitted to the Parliament, but to a national Council of Defence.
Not more than the civilization procedures will be prohibited in military courts, as requested for human rights protection associations.
These are also part of their concerns about the text, which they judge freetic.
The rate of blasphem is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which may have severe consequences on the freedom of expression, particularly of pressure.
Furthermore, no article is more efficient to the protection of women, underlined Hea Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
While the President of Egypt should be expressed yesterday at the TV, demonstrations are provided this afternoon.
The supports of the chief of the State will defile them on the Sabbath.
In Israel, holy places, the Centre of the World and a sea of saume are waiting for the Ukraine tourists

The believers and travel the Rue of the Soffrance or the Road of Croix (in Latin: the Dolorosa Via).
This path begins near the Force of Antonia (the pretorium), where the process was held, then led through the streets of the old city to the church of the Saint-Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crossification, and then to the Peter of the Unction and to the tomb.
This is the Christian center of the world, the symbol of human health.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Croix is thrown into the place where the tree has increased to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also opens the most holy place of the Jews: the wall of the Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to the tradition, people of different confessions leave small words with prayers that are then exaggerated.

For your journey, it is better to prefer the euro dollars, because they are easily changed in shekels (or today 1 dollar equivalent to 3,8 shekels).
For the town transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped from a fast tramway and Haifa has the only line of metro in the country, composed of six stations and can be able to release the low and high parts of the city.
It's almost a subterranea operator.
The treat in all types of common transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to change for 1 hours 30.

"What language is going to Moscow," migrants economized money to learn the language
While deputys and human rights militarys have given the law on the obligatory language test, frauders sold from "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint-Peterburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, these are residents of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tadjikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: winning money to help their families remaining in the house.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force, and it is stated that each migrant worker should have a Russian exam.
For this time, this rule is only those who are intending to work in the service sector, residence, services for special and sale to detail.
However, with the time, the federal migration Service, the tests will be obligated for all immigrants.
Furthermore, the knowledge of the language should be validated, but also the Russian history and law funds.
It will be necessary to validate its languages in Russia to get and renew its job permissions.
It is only the residents of the country where Russia has the official language status.
Persons who have received certificates or training diplomas before the emergency of the USS in 1991 are not yet concerned by this law.
Resources, negative aspects and protection of the rights
The network of the exam centers will be under the age of the Russian language Institute Pouchkine, the University of the peoples, the University of Moscow, the University of the State of Saint-Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrates may pass through examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened on all the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the Members of the State Doum and the federal Service of migration.
But before the law enters into force, the human rights defenders have already had many times the question in the press: what will this give?
What is the obligation to know the Russian will change for Russians and immigrants?
First, the representatives of the migration service are responsible for reducing the number of people who suffer "slavagism to work".
Many speak about the defence of the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Service of Migrations in Tadjikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of the rights must be started before they leave.
Only a organizated choice system will be able to resolve foreign workers' problems at 90%.
Problems are made for migrants without professional, without training, those who don't know the language and don't have medical certificates.
Without understanding of the language, Zebelev, the future migrant is destined to cross dishonest people who, under the pretext of help, will provide him a "good" in a surprised house where he and the tenth of his similar ones will turn around for months without food and without paper, and they will have to trimme between 12 and 14 hours per day.
We receive many plains from our migrants.
"To them, we promise something to them, and when they arrive, they throw them, they take their passport, and they don't touch the provisional payment," confirms the Director of the migration services for the work of the Migratory Service of Tadjikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't discuss me, sir!
However, many residents of the Central Asian Republics who want to win money in Russia believe that they don't only know the language of the country where they want to come, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
It is certainly not their fault, but well their worst: little Turkmenes, Ouzbeks, Tadjiks can allow us to follow it is only a passive primary teaching.
In fact, their families don't even have food for their children without talking about them correctly and equipment for school.
When they arrive to adolescent, these young parties will win money since the opportunity is present.
It's hard when we don't know the language, they trust.
"You feel red and loved."
Human rights defenders, however, notes a major aspect of the law on the language.
The tests will only be destined to migrants who have a legal statute.
Without status, there will be no exams or official work on the other hand.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia in an illegal way.
"Come welcome or defense of entering"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get a official state in Russia.
The administrative barriers and still these language difficulties.
Furthermore, money legalization costs: between 12 and 16 miles.
And then, we can get a false record fast for only 1500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, we don't have records, where extorsion cases are.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, the tea," trusted the journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, a resident of Tadjikistan.
"Speak fast, don't worry and get a beautiful art work."
Since the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was discovered that migrants were not only false.
Many false language testing certificates have already been defined by the employees of the federal service of migration.
False papers are out of a normal colour.
However, their new owners did not earn them for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the tests had to disrupt seven thousand rules for this document.
It's two times and half more loving than the official procedure: this will cost the migrant worker three thousand robes.
The representatives of the power and human rights defenders agree to say that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to just acquire these "cart bottoms".
The authorities can give migrant workers who could not validate the exam of the first time to follow language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who don't know the Russian will see a work in areas that do not affect to communicate actively with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take care of the weapons market
The part of the crimes involved in legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to sustain the law with civil weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities against recent incidents: that it acts in marriage or murder organised by the Muscovite jurisdiction Dmitry Vinogradov, who made seven dead.
The police wants to interrupt the port of balls in caoutchouc in public sites and to reach the legal age of obtaining the weapons port through 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the captain of the Douma Committee for Security and Combat against Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, which promised that the amendments on the weapons would be introduced next to the Doma.
Everyone is not satisfied to see that Russian authorities are trying to resolve the problem with "the fishing."
A open letter is appeared on the Net where its authors, representatives of various fire centres are required to leave "the hardly insensed".
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapons is minimized, reported to the Russian Vasiliy Lesnikov, legal and specialist of the crime for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, on a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were made with an immatriculated firewave in police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were registered at the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that the strengthening of civil weapons will not prevent criminals to approach the black market .
According to them, we can find any weapons in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that he controls the differences of illegal weapons.
Providers: of the office
The black weapons market is provided through several channels.
The main channels are at five, Victor Baranets, colonel to the retraite who serves ten years in the Ministry of Education and General Quarter.
Screen captured from a site to take weapons commands
The first is "the military trace," it is the weapons that have been flyed during military operations in the Caucase.
"These weapons have been fled by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons issued from the Black Market are the criminals to the order forces.
Baranets explains that there are also weapons flyed in police stocks and those directly developed to representatives of the order forces.
The illegal weapons sell from military trappes.
Many of these lasts have often explosions.
"On tested versions indicate that some fires have been deployed to discriminate the deficit," explains the military old.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are for something.
"We see private weapons that do not review the competition on the international market and spread the weapons on the black market, in particular in Moscow," says an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is the contraband.
A major part of pistolets and mixtures provide poor countries, such as Kirghiz.
"We find a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organized the approvisionship," adds the military old.
Where are the weapons?
Experts evaluated the close part of each illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was established in 2011 by the analyse Centre of Problems and Studies for public administration.
Specialists have analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data on weapons.
The majority of illegal weapons, explaining researchers, come from the army and the forces of the order.
The half of the weapons presented on the black market if there was found "with the employees whose work is linked to the weapons," explains in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons are providing military conflict sites, 14% are flyed during the production and 5% are exhausted from "Clanest Flowers".
A soldier and consulter of an armor requested to keep anonymous assessment that nobody takes the weapons found by these specialists of the Clandestine fools; they are too old.
The most often, according to him, the soldiers will look for new markets in military trades.
The person buys through a trainer teaches a unit, for example a TT gun.
We're delivering her to pass the market by a grilling.
"He's transporting it to town and revenge for 900 € by the unit with two loaders," he says.
"It is true that the police is currently at all business, so when crimes are on the point of being elected, it takes control at illegal weapons," adds the soldier.
"It's like in a luxury boot."
The vendor and the acquirent are generally found by knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy appears and proposes me to come to Begovaya's garage where someone had to bring me into a "coin" to marchand.
The weapons price, we gave it to me.
Victor Baranets and military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explain the soldier, but I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are vendors on the markets, but there is also to come by saying, "A part of such person, who asked me to transmit her daughter has lost a dent."
Now I'm even buying a couple of American pounds in help of a person I trust.
He just books them to me because he knows I'm not giving it.
The small news look for weapons in various ways.
The ancient military Victor Baranets tried as an illegal army carrier in the middle of 1990 when he was prepared to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to him, haven't changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "all what we want."
"I believed in a luxury boot," remembers the military.
There's no secret for the accommodator, Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential client, I don't like to buy, we're going with the soldier in the forest and install a target.
"We let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapons go well, we're beginning to negotiate," describes the expert.
A boot from his canapé
Research engines show the sites and VContakte groups where you can buy weapons "for various uses".
For this, we need no document and no one to meet.
"There's enough to have a precise sum of money," we wrote in public on the site "Come a gun or a battle."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we're sold to the boys?
"Sans allows, of course," asked the user "Ivan" (shared orthographe).
"Accete T. Moscow," wrote "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a large network of false sites and robbery of the people who want to buy wars.
People run on food as wounded skins, and then they find out to explore carbon in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and old military
I heard about this type of schemes: generally the site is recorded outside the Russian laws application field.
People take commands.
The purchaser carried out the payment on the automatic branches.
"He received a photo and instructions indicating where the weapons are hidden," explains the secretary of the Association "Reright to a weapon," Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets states that by makeing a request on the site, we can find out without weapons and behind the bars.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a large network of false sites and robbery of the people who want to buy wars.
"The people run on the food as wounded skins, and then they're going to explore the carbon in Siberia," - says he.
A Makarov for 100 dollars
The achievement of an illegal fire weapons, including experts, may cost between 100 and 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Association "Driet to a weapons", we can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
He'll have to wait for a month and half.
It has been exposed from the long-term training by the direction of these average sizes.
According to the official data of the Ministry, on the period of January-October 2011, the number of these crimes has reduced 7% in Russia and increases 22,9 miles while the events of air and extortion of weapons, munitions, explosive substances and bombs have been low to 7,8%.
United States: fast-food employees and supermarkets are green
Before a fourth of the American adolescents passed by a case work in McDonald's
The last days, a protest vague has been mounted against the bass salaries worked by the supermarkets of Walmart and the fast restaurant chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can prevent if this vague will take the wide or suffer fast.
These actions are supported by syndicates and a number of left associations.
Parallel to the increase of modest salaries that achieve basic salaries in Walmart and in rapid restauration chains, the demonstrations organizators want to get syndicates.
This sector is not now covered by syndical movement.
46 cents per year?
The demonstrations started last week after the Thanksgiving, the Black Vendredi, at the moment when a deferenced soldiers rained from millions of residents in America and sometimes discovered sclanders.
On that day, some of the Walmart society soldiers, who work in the world 2,2 million people, left their position to organize green pickets with syndicates and the left activists in the company stores which products are destined to the consumers of modest and medium classs.
Walmart commercializes everything: boards to the shoes through car battery, aspirators, eggs and lake.
Products are in average 8% to 27% less love than in large supermarkets.
That's why many bad payments in Walmart do only their courses on their workplace.
The price and choice of products made from Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critical criteria, Walmart may be allowed to sell its good market products, especially because of the low salaries of his employees.
These lasts are also planning hard work conditions, for example, the missing of higher carriers or portable scanners.
The participants of the Black Vendredi demonstrations requested a increase of payment, and they were clear that the price of medical ensure provided by the company was increased by 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic salary in Walmart who touchs $9.5 for the hour, it's a sum that he can't allow.
Scientifics of the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average payment to $12 for hour, it would cost 3.2 billion dollars.
It's 1,1% more than that he actually expenses.
If Walmart had transferred the total increase of the salaries on consumer rooms, each course in the magazine would return them to 46 cents more.
They'll pay only $12,39 in a year more than now.
Walmart Parents note with satisfaction that Protestations have occurred in only nine States and have not brought any prejudice to the group.
The " Black Vendredi" continued in the 8th magazines at midnight, and Walmart sold 5000 articles on this period at the second.
His boxes have been carried out for 100 million transactions for the Black Vendredi.
The port-word of the company Dan Fogleman ensures an interview on the left website of Huffington Post that in all "five" soldiers of Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was only a "coming operation among others" part of the organizator's syndicate.
"Next Customer!"
Protestations continued this week in New York and were not more concerned with the Wallmart magazines (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, therefore they are not yet implanted) but McDonald's and other good market restaurants.
McDonald's announced to sell billions of portions and after they don't even give you diseases and don't pick you the job you did honestly!
Jumane Williams, member of the Municipal Council of New York
Currently, the minimum payment provided by the Federal Legislation and the New York is $7,25 for the time.
Fast-foods increase them with time, but at least, in the middle of their basic employees touch at New York 8,90 dollars for the time.
No one touchs less than they in this city.
For me, it's unconscious to live with this room in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American boys worked in McDonald's house after school all lived in their parents.
Some people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find me to interview McDonald's soldiers who are pleasant to live with this salary and sometimes have to eat their children with.
Otherwise, on the Wall Street Journal Forum, we find comments saying that it is irresponsable to make children if you don't know what you're going to eat them.
The demonstrators who launched the judic movement at 6h30 near McDonald's 40th street and on Madison Avenue required that the fast-food cookers and cookers would be paid at least $15 per hour, or a multiplying more than two times than the current minimum payment.
They also asked what syndicates were created in the rapid restauration sector.
The United States law prohibited the administration to obstacle and punish the protectionists of a syndicate by broadcasts or licences.
However, the administration is easy to simplify their life.
For a syndicate, a quick restauration remains a hard task, and this is, for specific reasons.
One of the mains is the extraordinary rotation of the personnel.
They're not agreed.
Other tumultuous demonstrations were nearly several other quick restauration strings.
The time of protesting was the collection in the middle of day near the McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including Jumanee Williams, member of the Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's announcement to sell billions of portions and then they don't even give you disease congestion and don't suffer the work you did honestly."
The demonstrators were supported by other new York democracies in view, including by the candidate at the office of M. Bill De Blasio, who said that "We all need to support the payments of the fast restaurant to get a right and economic well-by-by-by-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-see-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-le-le-se-the-the-the-the-the-the-le-see-the-see-the-the-the-the-the-le-le-le-see-the-see-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-le-le-le-le-le--le-le-----le-----le-----le--le---the------le---the---------le---------le--------------le-le---------le-----le-------le-------------le-------------------------------------the-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The New York Times characterized this demonstration as the most important that he knew the sector of the fast restauration in his history.
But only several hundreds of people have participated without counting that they were no fast-food salaries, which worked for thousands of people in New York.
It's now hard to say if this mass movement is gonna make small.
"For the moment, we're just coming out in the middle of the brain."
Lastly, the fans of new technologies have been used to perceive the reality increased through special lunettes.
At the department, it is Google who devoted this was his current model during his yearly conference, and in November, it was learned that Microsoft had made a short request.
However, it is the maintenance with the Director of the 3D technology technology group of the Microsoft Cambridge Laboratory, Shahram Izadi, which for the scientists of this society, the lunettes are already from the old history.
They are trying to manipulate virtual objects in cloud hands by creating open virtual spaces.
- Can you tell us in some words what does your research group?
- We work on the interaction between human and the machine and try at the same time to expand the borders of this interaction.
Humanity in its total is remained for the time at the pixels on platform and sometimes at the tactile.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and become racial changes that will happen to this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect captors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sell today without Kinect because everyone interests in the command by the gest.
- What do we also reserve the future?
- Although Kinect has made the physical interaction, many things are broken on platform screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the rate, for now, is not real.
We are trying to change this and work on 3D image systems that work on various technologies, including projection technology.
We need to make the computer world out in our physical world, more tactile.
To this, however, we need to identify not only the user, but also the space that around it.
So we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin, let's get out of these stupid fats of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the vocal order?
She's nice, but isn't she surprised?
We can't say that it's the panice: the question of confidentiality is not always intended to report others of its actions or its intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in his neck.
For example, to command devices in public sites, we had a project for which we think about gestures, not large gestures, but instead of discrete gestures, restricted.
The managers were not captured by the camera of the camera, but by a bracelet carried into the hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a monster.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: geste + voice.
- That's what?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this ticket?
You'll do it with the word and the gestures.
- Normally, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or not do at a given time?
- It's not obligable, but it's a mutual approach.
I think we should work at the development of new types of captors that will make us better identify human reactions.
For example, the laser captors can be acted, they produce a good resolution in depth, and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect captors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Are they missing resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is about the current generation we based on our work on the 3D recognition.
Obviously, it would be good to obtain about 8 butaps with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the steels themselves, but even the quality of matrice and depth.
In relation to this last point, all the current technologies are sufficiently good, that adds the work to the algorithm designers.
The resolution must be maintained in the spirit in accordance with the X and Y, but also Z.
The speed also imports much, the number of frames at the second.
Human movements are enough dynamic, and 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathique, from our Redmond Laboratory, gave to touch the captors a regular period of treatment included between 1 and 100 μs, the current captors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this affects human and machine interactions.
I would likely need a device of this type in my work, but not to touch, to have more frames in the second.
- But don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect has three "cameras" today, which one is actually an infra-round and the second, an receiver of the reflection signal.
And the third camera is actually a normal captor of the visible field.
She doesn't need to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could resolve this problem...
Or emphasize it by increased the required calculation volume.
It would be interesting to create a supply product similar to Kinect, playing with the camera curve and see how it could help to define locations.
- While I remember, Microsoft, on the difference of Google, he didn't present his lunettes to the public.
Do you not think that a day-day use point of the increased reality technologies are one of the platforms that represent the most perspectives?
- You hear, walking all the time with a smartphone the hands are not practically practically, but this is what I think, the best option would be an increased "transitorial" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass the balls to the smartphone.
The lunettes are a very personal device and it is that makes their strength (personal elements are those you're the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from lunettes will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other persons.
- Let's imagine a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not more accessible than to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simply dead.
There is a problem on which the opposers at this idea point the deck: there is no tactile feeling!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers are your group prepared for this disaster?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh perceived in the interaction between human and the machine.
I think the eighth could be very well to add tactiles feelings.
For this time, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to use image support.
She records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologys that are really designed to appreciate the ability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultraseconds guided to a specific point where the dawn is found and that gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, a air suffice on the bottoms of the dogs.
There are also bracelets ported on the pockets that influence the nervous ends of the dawns, and they are also a work axis presenting perspectives.
- And you tried to smoke the brain?
Does he believe he feels what he should usually feel when he sees something?
That's a good idea, we haven't yet been trying.
There is still a job under which it needs to be a long time to give evil: the way to believe someone who is physically found in a very reduced space that he walks in a open space almost unfinite - we work on the concepts of the course tapes (the way to see with those who are in the fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also gearing balls.
For this time, we only have been driving through the brain, it remains still many work years.
This is what works on virtual reality as interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fecondation.
The kingdom of the goat and not of the culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the draft "The forward-garde Petersburgoise" dedicated to citizens who are in the front of culture and art.
This super-selective list has already received great actors of the artistic scene of Saint-Peterbourg whose realities are beyond the border of the city and who have found a reconnaissance in Europe after they were known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the painter to extract Kirill Miller.
All the city knows Kirill Miller, instead of barbu, all red clothing that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Early Jardin, or still in the white feasts and branches.
Kirill Miller's tables always gather the people, whatever their exposition place.
It is one of the social and philosophical petersburgh counters, one of the new mythes funders.
Kirill Miller is an exciting representative of the pre-garde Petersburgoese at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, his apparence makes the inhabitants smile and makes them good humor.
He recently took a barbarian orgue in his hands and became the symbol of this instrument in Saint-Petersburg because he had enough misfortune for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his bohemian image.
- Kirill, why do you park the city all in red and not in yellow or in Turkey blue, for example?
- I've chosen the red as specialised in the view and image.
In this world, the red is a compromise between the pinter, the image creator and the society.
Even if in the society, everything that is not grid is excited by the aggressive and negative agitation.
But my causes are destined to address the discussion.
The whole story of my provocatory actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you understand that you should be painful?
- At the exposition of the Palace of the Nevskiy culture where my work was found.
I realized that it was my way.
So the vague of old non-official pincers was passed and the new, free, in my kind, were incomprehensive.
I started to connect to my friend with the pieces of the new vague, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to Pouchinskaya-10, and then there was no vague.
I'm interested in the teater, mode, music, all kinds except words.
And all this was found in your artistic Clinic... it was important for me to find me in the center of Saint-Petersburg's culture where the best creator forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10 who opened a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the petersburgh.
Many are born: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrived with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends singed easy songs in play-back in mouling maillots, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, composer today in mode.
When the group started in life, he became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg did not live bad exmissions before Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it's when his great carrier started, but his education and its basic education, it's our home that he received them.
Gallerie "D137", Club "Griboiedov": these are the influences of the artistic Clinique.
Our employees have gone as usually.
I'm a hero of the past century, from the time that culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a sondage was organized in the press: it was the price "The personalities of our city."
I was called "Pintre of the Year", and it's when my kingdom has finished.
It is not comfortable to work in a new time with ancient rules, I am a representative of truth, honestity and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, it can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your works are characterized by a recognisible style.
- Many of my tables are hits, they have a reality and a very strong acute.
I'll have a planned exposition "The Russian museum through the clowns."
The clowns are a temporary category.
Before I was a society, it's doing bad today and it's scared to be so.
But with the clowns, it's all over, the tragic falls.
I love the biggest, I have big ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through the total and obligation.
Today, it's the room that is important, we're interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him the hand, but we need to cut him on the throne.
And the liar will be cut off by the destruction.
- Recently we saw you in the role of Barbarian orge player.
Who else than I can play it.
- But maybe the commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today, the trade art must be smoking, delicate, liquorable.
A decentration of culture is intended to produce it.
Before, people were shared in ships, the partisans of the boom loved one thing, the niats were another.
Today, everything is divided in micro-communities, it's hard to enjoy everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar ballet to enjoy everyone.
Today, we need to think about what you like.
Everyone sees 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- These are people who have been driven to see it. It's the sex and social side that's going.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and at the top of the account is less management, money, all loss.
I have my fans, the main is not to smoke them, not to lose the life.
When I was young, I taught tables that a collector across Falk or Larionov.
I've started with the tables that usually are those who are in the end of life.
Today, we're often confusing the ideas.
It is said, there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
The consumption doesn't have culture. It's nothing to see.
I am a representative of the culture yesterday, I grew up with the example of peninsulas who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused the money just for penalty.
I'm for that culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in Saint-Peterburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the officer of the culture.
But everyone can't work in culture.
Under the kingdom of good thers, it wasn't like that, the thresholds didn't understand the culture, but they understood that he had to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultors today.
We have people here in Saint-Peterburg that could be experts, but they are exhausted, because they need higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and make them a path.
Currently, it's the "good kingdom" who flows.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense that they say honestly that they don't take all the contemporary art, that there are peninsulas that have to find other museums.
- For you, what's Saint-Petersburg?
- Saint-Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a sun for this.
And on our stones, the art has bad to put it down.
We need a cultural area and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe there are many curious who will see expositions, concerts.
In our house, this bed is very good.
We have to make the art in the mode as it was the case at the beginning of the past century.
Project implemented with the support of St. Petersburg
Hide in space
The earth is in danger.
Climate refrigeration or collision with a murder asteroid.
Space ships with territory at the border are going to search for a safe planet.
To save humanity, a great question is: how can we continue to live our species in a career or still on a safe planet?
I think there's no choice.
There are in fact two real planets that can be conquired, not only by hypothesis.
"It is from Venus and March, named Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the Astronomical Institute of P.K. Chernberg (GAICh).
If on March the conditions are more adapted for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live at a very high height or on the orbite of Venus... in the space.
We started to interest in the issues of reproduction in the area focusing on the flower.
A half century ago, there were experiences on plants.
Four generations of small because cultured on orbite were not differences in any way of territory variations.
Then, we were put on the orbit of insects, small drosofills.
In 1979, cail eggs were sent into the space to see how an embryon was developed in the area.
We're getting a pousin totally normal in the outside.
Then the problems start.
" The problem is linked to the fact that the poussin must find a support, he must be put on his pattes and start moved, explains the director of the Laboratory of the Institute of the Medical Problems of the Russian scientists (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
With no support, the pousins were disordered.
And over 10 hours, new births saw their instincts totally attrophy.
The pousins did not react to the light or the sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die for four days.
"We cut their eyes twice, then we left, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev with the loss of experience with pousins in the space.
The last "miniature archive" with animals has been sent on orbit 16 years ago.
Experience will continue at 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion" will only be packed by species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their feet in the space.
In principle, we found nothing of surnatural.
"It's still biosatellites, and then it's the only experience. We need to do this kind of research," makes Vladimir Sychev.
After the aircraft, the space rates gave their progeny.
However, we are not yet going to do playing directly in space.
It's not a little business.
By losing their normal environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct.
In contrast to animals, the man is capable, in principle.
The Scientific Homo has the abstracted thought, it is able to create a convenable emotional fund.
This type of experience is not implemented for ethical reasons.
But women are in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has more precious.
Our moot was involving, and nobody on Earth could say if he had a fly in the space.
If she could be born to a child after the flight.
"Nobody answered this question ", explains Vakhtang Vatchnadze, retraction of the Fusions and Space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after his flight in the space, the first woman cosmonate Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiw, was also cosmonate.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonate Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been two times on orbit and has worked in the extra-free, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk is lost.
We have a little, even very little cosmonautes that have nothing happened and give birth to a full health seed after long flows.
"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during the orbit flows, concluded the pilot and cosmonate, the heroes of the Soviet Union and the heroes of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humanity needs to look for new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrogology Laboratory of the Cosmonautes Preparing Centre: obligatory step for preparation on the air.
Here, in no floatability, cosmonautes are trained to extra vehicles.
The water follows the staff.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but, however, a foreign environment, for foods, is their real element.
Little amfibian men seem to be confirmed: life on Earth is from the ocean.
In the measure where the baby develops about 9 months in the limpfatic liquid of his mother's wind, it is easier to dwell on the water.
It's in logical principle, because from his birth to his first bathroom, it's only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the Natation Instructor for food, Marina Aksenova.
In one word, if for the child who comes to born the parent is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a weight force.
In addition, the muscles of the wind, the bassin are very quickly attrophy, the ability of the baby's poussy is lost.
All right, we don't know that supports us on the simulators of complaints.
Of course, we can prepare a bunch in a special room, the woman will come out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite to think about this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravitation.
If it doesn't feel the earthly attack, the organization does not form the sketch or the muscle system.
We can't have a food as adult with a special combination for training.
It will be just private of his live needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will be returned to the Terre of a disappointed child, completely disappointed, " proposes the Director of the Committee for Bioetics of the Institute of Medical Problems of the Russian Scientists, Igor Pestov.
Children's birth in the space is still exceeding theory.
However, with the time it will be real, when the Territorys will go into their ships to a far planet that will become the lives of their descendence in space.
The head of the ISC (the higher Institute of Public Finance Control) stated: " the control of the independent pseudo work (the Chec " Svarc system ") failed because of policies.
In the area of public markets, the Czech Republic provides competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is to train it for its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala declared, the Vice-President of the Institution's above control of public finances in an interview for currently.cz.
"The Law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and, in my opinion, it is what does wrong with us," said Kala in his comment of the present situation.
A control of the technical and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
It quotes as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "Schvarc system " by Peter Netem.
Mr. First Ministry recently stated that the ODS would not be imported by companies with controls; is it allowed or prohibited?
"The Law must be applied well in a way or in another way, so if it has been prohibited something, even the Government's captain can refuse to act a loaded authority to inspect the respect of the law," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Committee on Control on the Deputy Chamber, you have invited a Checo German project in the framework of which the public market legislations of these two countries have been compared.
What was it particularly questioning?
It's a parallel control we've launched this for about two years.
In simple terms, the European legislation provides how to manage public markets and special national legislation and a proper practice to be given to him.
We have gathered all this and even though this control procedure is not yet completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be "great and better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as it is better in Germany.
This is therefore confirming that it is not sufficient to continue to develop more and more detailed rules but that it is necessary to concert its implementation even in the implementation of the law.
What can this project help you concretely and what will it result for you?
A common control of this type should just contribute to what we decide to determine the laws, low down and improve the grounds, when it does not have a very positive effect.
The principle of good management means to obtain the question to a reasonable price (what does not always mean the lowest), to exclude all the risks and an eventually criminal activities.
But by lowing market levels, this objective will not be achieved strongly.
It may be that this system is in such a point submitted by the papers, that those who look for it will find more opportunities than if the plane remains higher.
You are talking about internal problems on the implementation of the legislation of public markets.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an analog institution on our ISC or a different organization mode?
For the institutions, as well as the ISC, the Bundesregungshof that is organised similarly, also has a Council constituted a little differences, but these two institutions are based on analogy procedure .
The competences also are, in a certain way, similar, with a noise in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, it also provides accounts of this type at the level of different countries.
The BRH can only control the federal money, which corresponds to us with the resources of the State.
The public funds of our home by regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the country accounts.
What about the national legislation is it easier than our?
I would not like to make a general comparison without specific data, however, in some areas, Germany is often designed as a model but we can not say that it is better in all areas.
Is it possible that they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I don't have comparison data.
However, it is also necessary to say that this country we consider as a model is also compared to a series of problems.
If they had no benefit to cooperate with our institution, don't they?
What about the national legislation, which has meaned for you, as a institution, the amendment of the law on public markets, do they have already heard?
This amendment has recently entered into force, it has not yet affected our control operations.
As we make controls later, we need to count with a certain late time.
Our observations only concerns the preparation process of future controls - we have started a new tool of "detecting the risks of evil management" with which we have passed to the crible at about 14,000 public markets - there will well hear these changes, because they have been amended and the conditions of certain types of calls and then.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law in place as a benefit or as an override of charge for administration?
I think this law is a step in the good direction, and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can happen is that these rules become serious and that it is not possible to respect them.
Under the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the regional advice, in the case of regional operational programmes) committed the controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on markets means a failure to the budgetary disciple.
So is it really useful to make the most severe law in this way?
No, not this way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who do formal errors without consequences on the decision process.
This system will make a better pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the First Ministry stated that the ODS would not be imported by the undertakers with controls of the Swap system - what does that mean?
Is the Svarc system prohibited or authorised?
The law must be applied well in a way or in another way, so if it has been prohibited something, even the Government's captain can stop acting a loaded authority to inspect and require respect of the law.
He can say, "We will change the law and authorize it," but he can't say we're going to act like nothing.
The law on markets provides relatively strictly rules on formalities to fulfill, and it is just to protect the call of offers.
However, it is tragic to be eliminated only for formal failure.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just, and it is, in my opinion, what does wrong with us.
The roads are by yellow places, but most of them are practical.
In some places of the Czech Republic, the roads are held and also denied.
However, the network remains in greater practiceable part, at some places with a increased monitoring.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the region of Karlovy Vary, the routes were practicable this morning, but by yellow places and also denied.
The temperatures have broken and oscillated between -5 ° and -10 ° C but they should be easily up to the day.
Snow snows have stopped in the region and remains in the areas only a end of snow snow.
However, the crowds of the metalphures (Crushne Hory) are recovered from about 30 centimeters of snow.
It contains data from the regional maintenance of the roads, which, based on brouillard, the visibility was reduced.
The fast route R6 and the national routes of the region are now practical without difficulties.
However, the monitoring remains in place, for example, on some points which the clothing can be stealed and glassed.
All department routes and third category paths, including mountain routes, are also practical.
It remains still on some of their thrones of the rest of yellow snow and in places based by the trafic.
In particular in the areas located in highness, the drivers must strengthen their surveillance.
Pardubic and Hradec Kralové Regions
The Direction of Roads and authors sign on its website that some Eastern Bohemes roads are threatened by the training of snow layers and that training can be found on the roads in the mountains and located in highness.
Road maintenance services are maintained by conductors against the risks of training in the areas of Pardubic region located in highness.
There can be a verglace in the areas of Lanškroun, Usti over Orlici, Polička, Svitavy or Wysoke Míto, and this, mainly on department routes and third category.
The I/43 and I/34 roads were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly in the Mounts of Geants (Krkonoses) and the Mountains of l'Aigle (Orlical Hory).
In the districts of Richnov over Princena and Trutnov, a snow snow snow stealed by the traffic is present on the streets in the areas located in highness.
In East Bohemma, the time will be now seen, most often disappointed, with an event of noise passions.
It will suffer a low wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3 ° and + 1° C.
Pilsen Region
The paths of Pilsen region are today practical, although, in place, it must be evidence of increased monitoring and adapting its conduct to the meteorological conditions.
This morning, the temperatures are oscilling between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snow challenges and the refroidation followed, some communication paths can be held by white places.
The drivers can wait to travel brouillard areas, however, the visibility will improve progressively.
This is the information of the regional maintenance of the routes.
The D5 author is nearly practical without difficulties, but the maintenance of routine communications services recommends a increased monitoring between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The clothing of most national roads is seal and gele.
Some thrones can be read in the District of Pilsen-Sud and Tachov District.
Departmental and third category are humble and in this case, it is applied to be maintained against the thrones held.
The drivers must be watching, and this is particularly on the less frequency roads in the area of Sumava.
Olomouc Region
The drivers in the areas of Olomouc, located in highness region, must today be counted with a snow-snow layers on the roads.
This board is left on the col "Cervenohorische Selo" and on the road in direction of Videlski Cross, after chemical treatment operations.
Snow snow challenges have confronted the road maintenance personnel to go on the ground; in accordance with the services supported by the town, he has fallen over three centimeters in the Sumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most of the challenges are practical without difficulties.
" At the heights of the district of Sumperk, there are remains of snow.
The drivers running in Jessenika should be expected to meet the coal "Cervenohorski selo" a snow sky and snow steel ", said today to CCTK the chief of the maintenance services of the streets of the district of Sumperk.
Their colleagues in Jesenius district also have been placed during the night; according to these lasts, after the chemical treatment, the routes are now disappointed and mourned, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are practicable without difficulty, however, in the Sterberk district, the drivers should be careful in the forest streets to the humided chaussures.
Ust regions over Lab and Liberec
Since this morning, the North Boheme Road Services have reported several difficult thrones.
It refers to the police data, which, in more than some of the locations covered of snow or snow, the mountain route goes from Telnice to Kninice in Ausstecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain under zero in lower height, so the snow and the snow should be maintained on the roads. In the fields, in particular in the south is the Central Platt of Boheme, there is no problem and routes are generally seen.
No circulation difficulty has been signed for the moment.
The travel maintenance services have reported the presence of verglass, in particular to Steti's staff.
According to the meteorologists, the nighttime conditions were ideal to its training: rain and rain for day, swallowed sky and yellow during the night.
In addition, from the main circulation axis, difficult conditions on national road 13 at the border between the regions of Uzsti Over Labem and Liberec.
The closing of the circulation between Telnice and Kninice is due to tree branches that were cornered under the shadow of the snow until the chaussy is achieved.
Simon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect from positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that at least one month this should be the end of the world?
It's only one of these new alarms, the kind of pieces in which we love to fall.
In our group The Tap Tap, we are in the same place and we are saying that we are the only group that can collect a positive energy rest to repeat or stop the end of the world.
Furthermore, you go up a project in December, in fact, only: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you show this project more in detail to our readers?
It's a caritative action we're prepared for two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing on the end of the Maya calendar for 21 December to 11.10.00 tomorrow.
The veil, on 20 December, three concerts will be simultaneous in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will be fulfilled practically when the Maya calendar will end on the island of Kiribati, which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time field for 12 hours in relation to us.
Who had that idea?
In the department, I think it was my idea, and then we constructed everything with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Outside the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to, with the public, think about the situation of the world we leave our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have created a collection of unique objects, including chaussures, T-shirts, sacks, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online on www.e-tap.cz, people can also support us.
The Tap Tap Group with other interpretes has also recorded a hymne against the end of the world that is intituated " Fine of the world cancelled " (Tchèque " the end of the world zrusseno ").
She's already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it in these caritative concerts?
Of course, at the end, if we succeed and the end of the world has no place...
It will be singing simultaneously by all interpretes in the three concerts.
Hymnes will also be joined at a time given in the framework of a direct emission, in fact, on the technical TV.
The words of this song were written by Thomas Hanak, who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X y sing...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We're working with other personalities of the show-biz show, because we're organized of many caritative concerts and events...
We are trying to participate intensely in these projects.
The most of them were interested by such a cooperation and that it loves them.
What will these concerts benefit from the end of the world?
In order to equippe the Studeo training center that is accessible to people in reduced mobility and which we work at the implementation of the Jedlička institution, with Tap Association, and it has been six years ago.
The teachers are regularly made to the students of Jedličččkov, and they propose activities that interest them and enjoy them.
Students themselves do not have ways to go to schools, we try to help them so.
In the end of the construction of Jedlička institution, we will transfer this project into a new independent building.
A number of music groups and interprets will go to the scene at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, do you have the choices?
We have tried to develop a programme that is addressed to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will go on the Chinese scene, Support Lesbians, Illustrtosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jire Search.
You will find all details on www.kpks.cz.
Do you also prepare for other " even events " of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play the first time in the Framework of Prague's printemps; there we will also prepare a quality program with interesting invitations.
We would also like to play the next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalists, for example, you played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a composed group of humans who are disappeared.
How do you guarantee the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it seems first.
We have five members in electronic equipment, which engines should travel in suit, naturally we trimbal many bags and tool boxes...
Before all of this is more or less well past, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they amazed me more once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, all happened without problems.
With your travels to the foreign, you can compare in what these countries differences for the facilities of access to reduced mobility persons, the attitude of public thinking in respect of humans and then.
What were your experiences until now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we have been witnesses in Moscow that all are still in a initial phase.
In relation to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to disappointed persons; there is not yet currently that a person moves only in electricity in the center of the city.
They are still not as a evidence of giving priority to an innocent person in a assessant.
Happyly, there is also a association that endeavours the attention of the problems of the happy persons is intended to be created.
What do we have to cut down the most developed countries?
There are many things for which we're still late...
It is important to indicate that improvements and performances are always depending on the efforts that are concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is actually current that people with a lot of handicap are moved only in public spaces; they can go to the tolets, to the museum, anywhere...
It's not even very frequency in that-- but a large number of disagreements participate actively in social life, at this point, you, The Tap Tap, are in contrast to the progress point!
The respect of the public and access facilities is one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have sports, artists, acts, politicals or jurisdictions.
For this time, it is only insulated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, we'll be back for a few years, what has helped you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as a educator in Jedlička, where I found a lot of young people ready to invest in something.
And as I am musician (I play, among others, saxophone), with a college, we created a musical activity.
And then, with the time, as our moderator Laдзіa Angelovič says, we had a little lost the control of the situation.
Have the success just happened in the last years, if I don't hurt me?
That is true, the fact of creating links with known songs and working actively on the promotion of the group has helped us.
We understood that if a job is not visible, it's like if it doesn't exist in the background.
By the subventions of the European Union, we can also allow teachers of quality, equipment, and then.
Have you been in order to get such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show of business is full of things that cool each other.
In some way, it's logical: everything new is accepted with proudness and it's a long time.
Rares are the original projects, and I admit that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally compassion, it's natural...
But the pity is totally inutile, because people with a handicap are not suffering, abandoned of all, that we have to take patience.
These are people who can live a whole life in the middle of the entire life, in order to have the necessary ways to be sure.
I'm often saying that when people with a handicap come to realize something, it's not only an advance for them but for the whole society.
Doesn't your success also beyond the fact that you're a former leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to make quality work, we must be intransitors in many areas and require a certain disciple.
But I think it's really normal.
Some people come home with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they take aware that they must come to the repetitions twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and pass a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they will quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But this is the same way in each group who wants to work and get objectives.
The Tap Tap Group is currently counted twenty members.
How many of them were already here in 1998?
One, Lady Angelovič.
We're a open group, people enter and go, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or wish to join us.
This will be the case of the day of the end of the world, July 20 December 2012 from 21 hours.
This action will be developed in Prague in the Incheba Arène, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynoem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relationships when the song of the Tap Tap " Fine of the world can be cancelled together. "
The objective of the concert is to collect financial measures (a higher 25 million CZK) to equippe the multi-functional training center in Prague in Jedlička.
The price of a ballet for this concert is 400 CZK, the input is free for children until 12 years, the preventing of the ballets is opened in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted as the twenty-fifth member of this Agency, it is the second Member State of the East Bloc (Tekse Republic has become a member in part on 12 November 2008).
Poland had developed a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and during the years following participated in a number of projects of agency.
The path of Poland to the space has started very early.
Since the second World War, passioned Polands worked on space flows; they did not always meet understanding.
For example, I would like to exclaim the Conference of A. Sternfeld to the astronomical observance of Varsovie on 6 December 1933, during which he presented an astronautical ideas from his pre-guard work " Introduction to the astronautical."
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left frod auditors and years later Steernfeld reminded that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Steernfeld received the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch for his work " Introduction to the astronautical."
Ledit Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautical.
He published hundreds of articles in the Poland Journals and wrote many works dedicated to this scientific disciple.
Gadomski became a propagator of the world's astronautical rename, and his contribution was particularly rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the hidden faces of the Moon.
Since 1925, a drain was built in Poland to be equipped by a fused engine.
We are not surprised to know the author or the details of this project.
It's not clear if the fuse should be used to shoot or shoot the drain.
Only known information on this drain is the pressure of the time.
Since 1933, the Poland artillery began to be dedicated to the fuses.
The research was carried out by the Colórka Techniki Usbrojenia in collaboration with the professors Miečslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It refers to documents contained that this research had achieved the stage of tests.
Of course, with the arrival of German army, research has been interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of a photo-electric chase fuse, designed by the Roxainian engineer, appeared in the specialised pressure and the next year was published by the work "Rakieta - airtorpeda and rakietobomba lotnica" of a author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects had a military use of fuses motors.
Just before the war, all projects of use of fuses were carried out by the provisional scientific consultative Committee ("Timczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowski"), which coordinated all works.
This Committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war was finished at its activities.
After the war, other aircraft works were published in the Poland Press, through the Poland Astronautical Society (Polski Astronautical Society).
Firstly, it is questioned about a company in November 1954, in which four more detailed articles are held in the aircraft.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotovicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to the astronautical society
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research had to be future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Poland astronautical society (PTA) has developed efforts to enter the international astronautical federation (created in 1951) and since the outcome, the PTA became a regular member.
The next year, the first President of the PTA, Kaziheim Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He keeps his function until he died in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA contributed significant contribution to the core development of success of the meteorological RM (Rakieta Meteorologicna), which became the first Poland Fund to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was finished in 1957 and the first launch was placed on 10 October 1958.
This smoking from 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and a little less than 5 kg.
Afterward, a improved version was built, RM-1A and, during the 1959, two RM-2 flow trials were taken into the desert of Bledov.
This fuzzy had a length of 1,4 meters and probably weighted 11,5 kg.
The following prototype should be able to implement concrete scientific works - the RM-34 fuse should have been a port to 14,5 km and serve the wind at high.
But in 1963, all development works were stopped.
The Meteor-1 fuse was established during the period 1962 - 1965, successfully with the first RM type fuses.
This fuzzy, designed with two steps, had a total length of 510 cm and a initial weight of 32,5 kg.
Three models (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved to scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A fuse had a space offering a volume of 0,4 litres, while the volume in Meteor-1B was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres.
The maximum port of all these types of inge was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 fuses were placed in the aircraft, the first aircraft tests started in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 fuse had a initial rate of 380 kg and was able to transport a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Afterward, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Polonia also participated in the spatial explosion on the artificial soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-sovietic cosmonate of this programme.
The abortion of the law on public use works is not a solution.
Last week, the Court of Constitution has abbrevied the law on public use works.
This decision has taken into public opinion a living debate.
It is no doubt interesting to examine this problem on a larger viewpoint.
Economic systems orientated to liberalism, as well as in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more regulated economic competition.
This means particularly that different economic entities and national economic systems are perpetually conflicting one another.
This results from the principle of liberty of trade and free circulation (no limits) of the private capital associated with an excessive financial specification.
The significant differences of the price of the work (salars) generated a tension on the prices.
The following meaning must be: a manufacturer efforts by the import of goods sold in the low statement of the economic competition in " make more precious " the price of the competitor, in order to remove a larger part of the market and to increase its own benefits.
In large scale, this means for most of the businessers: to transfer the production to the foreign, or to buy low prices, or to disappear, and the result is an important rate in countries where the prices of the work are higher compared to other economics.
Since the private capital has no responsibility for the social viewpoint and by the same responsibility in respect of the commitment that he has to ensure, the social charges of the State are required to increase.
All this situation intensifys the perfect will of the masters to pay payments and to compensate the economic and social sufferings caused to the whole society by this course to benefit.
This situation is in such a public notification that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
Private capital practices entrusted in various economys a situation in which the governments of different countries are contrary to launch in a mutual competition in order to achieve the social level of their own population artificially in order to achieve the foreign capital in their homes.
Furthermore, governments make their own population to the gratitude of the private capital without taking account of social funding.
This is mainly shown in the amendments of enforcement laws.
The objective is to ensure its own population economically to accept the diktate of prices of private capital, in particular in the field of payments.
This is a part of a system of economic contracts in the case of long-term and other part by the restriction of payment rights in the work legislation.
It results in a growing poverty and increased differences between riches and poverty.
In RFA, there are years of public food distribution points for poor people who can't get their needs with their own work.
We're already considered the number of these people for millions.
In the framework of the increased competitiveness of German economy, it is actually achieved that the soldiers receive such salaries that the State sees in contrast to pay a supplement for the minimum vital.
For example, such scandal has been updated in the case of salaries worked as assistants in the federal Parliament.
Economic measures of practically all EU Member States of the southern EU are not sure that an analogue situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic effort of the society, people are contradicted to emigrate (as it was in the 19th century), or to live with mixed salaries, in margins of the society, in the hope that a private capital investes in their country.
This is the following question: from where will this capital come?
If there are other EU countries, the poverty will pass from a country to another; this capital may not come any more, or then a Chinese, a Brazil, a Turk, a Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also concerns all Latin America.
The liberal theory and media are increasingly laid down that the State cannot make capital investments in its own economy, which the economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
The private capital defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy by regular interventions.
It is therefore necessary to ask whether the private capital does not affect and, even today, does not lead according to its own equivalent interests, political and the same, the whole State.
The answer to this question is no doubt yes.
The evidence is that there is a lobby practically powerful and present in all States.
It results in an unexpected situation that appears in the area of corruption, by the accommodation of mutual advantages, in the legislation, where everything is condemned but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such as because of the missing of financial measures, national ministers decline the development of law projects with a lot of laws related to the industry.
These law projects are then adopted in Bundestag.
The entire power does not come from the people, such as the west type constitutions, but strong financial groups serve their own interests.
It is clear that the democracies orientated to the Liberalism are now seen quickly compared to the situation described by Appianos in his work titled "the crisis of the Roman Empire during the César and Pompee": "The State was a long time full of delicence and the functions were assigned by violence.
The pots-de-vin cups, the favours obtained illegally, and the stones and the swords were also used to get these positions.
Under-de-table and corruption prolifered without limits, and the people went to the elections with already sold voices."... "The honest people didn't seek anything to get functions, it resulted once the State remained 8 months without consulting."... "We really began to say that the remedie to this situation was a difficult situation and that he had to choose an energy man."... It is true that Appianos had been in the spirit of Pompée, but that is the Chares who had changed irreversiblely the democracy in absolute regulation.
In conclusion, as in the antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal benefits, without a view to the interest of the society in its together.
In its meaning, the private capital is no longer able to understand and to assess the interests of the society together.
This results today as the previous time, a deadly deceiving without preceding elects, without any effort to achieve reforms in depth.
We should therefore look for the causes of the emergency of fascist and communist systems in liberalisation without scrupules of the economic systems of the XIX and XX century.
In the present state of things, the loss of these systems can be considered in the benefit of Liberal Democracies as a kind of break before a new step.
The fact that the current electors fully ignore the event of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, humanitarian and social crises which we are today witnesses and crimes against humanity such as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The abortion of the law on public use works is not a solution, at least long-term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, such as international and internal level, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to search for the ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is actually systemic.
The solution is in socio-politic reforms, which will strengthen State capital investments in the economy, will increase the influence of citizens on government and enhance the position of private capital in the society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"Nothing will never go out of violence and never can" says Sting in the named Fragile song, which is the main to the refrigerator is "we don't forget how fragiles we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there wouldn't be there," said Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his death bed in 1849.
Following the last vague of violence between Israel and Gaza band, as usually, many reactions have been exalted.
Some take the part of Israel, argueing their right to autodefence and place Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, calling the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about the question of knowing who is guilty and who is victims, in its recurrent killing ships; but the current inhabitants of Israel, including the autonomous territorys, are born in this political situation and have not lived in the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer to the readers a point of view located in the "back of the ride", on which mainly benefits of tensions that have already been lost for more than 95 years (a number of Balfour statement in 1917) in a small country of the Middle East.
Some of these opinions support historical facts available in the study, others from my own understanding of that, or more exactly of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The story of humanity is the history of a fight for power.
Each time, we can find a Alexandra the Grand or a Napoleon.
What is not so clear is to know whether these individuals act independently or if they should have their acts on the throne to someone who leads their actions according to previous objectives.
We need to admit that we live at a time when the world's richness is concentrated between the hands of some individuals and that this financial concentration that enhance certain powers could not be done during a single generation.
Astronomical riches are particularly different from the Rothschild family, which may be considered as the head of the pipe (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Nothing is written about them.
Good to hear.
Since the 1990s of the 19th century, they purchased the first World Press Agency (Reuters) to put a term to the establishment of links between their names and severe criminal acts to which they were mixed and had always signed for them a strength of their power, a increase of their strength or both.
They have large participations in the most of the central banks of the world and prevent or bring wars against countries in which they have not yet participated (for Afghanistan's invasion, the number of these countries were 7, after Iraq's invasion of 5, after Kadhafi's return was only 4 during the period, Russia put the Russian Central Bank under control of the Russian Government).
Everyone who tried to dress against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Central Bank of America of Rothschild and began to exchange his own money (governmental, I hear well) and was murdered in a teater in 1865.
JFK started to carry out their own money and wanted to discharge the FED, he was murdered in 1963, Mr Louis McFadden was in 1936, while he wanted to try a process against the FED to declare the great economic crisis of 1929.
In 1859 to 1871, their power supply was led to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a frank-maceson initiated at 33th grade, as the highest level.
The first war was to eliminate the large statistical monarchs in Europe, the second should remove colonialism, including British, and the third should reduce the world population between 1 and 0,5 billion individuals (the same slaves are sufficient for their luxury and consolidated), create a unique universal religion (the economic was nothing other than the love of such solution) and, finally, a absolute power.
The method used by the Clan of the most rich families with their head Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following the chaos).
These solutions are failure and are always leading to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the FED destined to avoid that the crises are not repeated like those they have provoked in 1907).
After discovering the first world war, the murdered in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, the heritage of Habsburg on the South Hongrois throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia by provoking the bulchevic revolution.
The first world war was brutally finished by a German capturation without economic and military justification (the war was not more necessary for the destroying of the Russian Russia) and it was followed by the march of Australia-Hongria, the power of Central Europe.
For a easier declaration of the second World War, the bankers have left the policy to create a stated conflict situation: one part, they have set to Germany pharmacians reparations that generate the conditions of radiakalization of the massages (they have enough to make a sufficient energy leader, showing the degree of criminals, proposing simple solutions) and otherwise, they have established a Tcosawk composed of different nationality, composed to the minority that is to join (the fifth-effective colon) to bring the fire and to the struggle of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the sionist movement, which one of the branches inspired the creation of a Jewish State, preference in the region of Judah historical with Jerusalem as capital (retorted to Zion).
The Balfour's statement mentioned above put the bases of a massive emigration of Jews to Palestinian and the first frictions with the Arab local population began.
The terrorist acts were committed by the other part.
The second World War is difficult to appreciate if Hitler broke the strings in which the international banks had first holded it; or if all that he had done was planned, the fact is that the sufferings of the Jews in Europe in the concentration camps create the basis of accepting a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; the same way that the war repairs imposed in Germany were in the origin of the second World War, the foundation of Israel's State had a family of fire that could cause a third world war.
If the international bankers are going to declare this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the second World War, the first victim of war, this time as the Arab people or generally Muslims in the Middle East.
Israel is like a large laboratory, the source of discorde and chaos, not only in this country, but at international level (such as it is enough to see how people are divided between parties and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victimed in the Israeli-palestin conflict, where a failure generate another wrong according to a cycle of violence without end and where are, in the origin of all, the quality of certain individuals and their desire to achieve power on the whole world?
There must be a difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as we are, international banks propose not to people than their own candidates.
The current Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascious, loyal in view of international banks, which makes everything to declare a war with Iran, which could, due to the accession of this country to Shanghai cooperation organization (Chinee, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) to be a global conflict and, because Iran controls the death of Ormus through which 20% of all global petrol (Naval currency is a larger than 2) and a destruction of the world economy.
Under which light now appears the proposals made by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a aristocratic pound of the financial is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born seems to implant an electronic puzzle that makes him a total control.
"Let all the individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry on the hand or before a mark on the red yellow, that he may not buy nor sell him who doesn't take the name of this feast or the number of his name.
It is necessary to understand that he who has a good sense counts the numbers of this ferro beast.
This number draws the man and it's six hundred sixty."
The Argo movie: When everything's going to be worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a multitude of demonstrators composed of Islamist students took the American campaign of Teheran and retained in 52 diplomates.
They should be released by Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who supported his regime for several decades.
The situation would not be offered to the American administration of positive exemption, and it could not, in fact, leave Shah, because she would have severely disappeared the confidence of her associates in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had moved on the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able to obtain the freedom of otages.
It was a hard time for the prestige of the United States, a couple was still aggressed later by the ransom of the trial of freedom of otages through force.
The separated diplomates were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian Government.
Their outcome makes the United States a solidarity and an anti-iranian feeling.
The Iranian debuilt contributes to Jimmy Carter's deficit in Ronald Reagan to the presidential elections of 1980.
The film Argo, of the actor and actor in scene Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory in America.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the campaign.
After compiled devices, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA was to make them out of Iran through a rocambole covering: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a tournary team comes to make repairs for the tournament of a movie in a large spectacle of science-fiction.
Combination of genes
The expert plan on exfiltration Tony Mendez requires Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to make the most creditable legend, specialised magazines made the status of this film project, press conferences were organized and a physical production company was real officers.
The details of the operation remained long secret, the film based on Tony Mendez memories.
The Affleck film is a insolent combination of many kinds.
It is a part of a political thriller designed in reality but also a "caper film", the report of a successful couple, a traitor, such as in the Ocean triology, twelve and thirteen.
The ambiences are successful: documentary style Sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented by iconographies of events and ways that, through these photos, these same situations have been transmitted into the film, there is no great differences),
passengers of Hollywood, treated with iron and a little exageration,
and then scenes of the CIA general quarter and other institutions with costued men discussing the situation around the conference tables, in colleagues and phones...
Ben Affleck succeeded to restart his carrier in a remarkable way.
Ridiculized actor, it became a respected meter and his actor's game stopped submitting ironical notes.
Argo is his third long-term long-term after the "Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It's also the first film of Affleck who doesn't deal in his original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that put its first films above the Hollywoodian standards.
Affleck also proves this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of the Teheran is "deserved" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are developed in the streets when rebuilding real facts; the initial sequence of the smoking of the embassy is impressive by its clearance that also suggests the confusion and improving increasing events when suddenly, in a given place, a story page is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have an analog effect in fictives scenes (the false tour team in the Teheran bazar).
A lot of actions too many locations
The scene meter had to be content of a subject in fact only a few palpitant scenes, in the meaning of the term.
The result is not always too elegant (the scene in which the crisis threat to the airport of Teheran is cut off by a couple of phones in America and the continuing on the aircraft track is sufficiently shooted by the heads).
The weakness of Argo remains in its dissipated character, needed to show too different events.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charms in their role of Hollywoodian co-operators, their personality would be a greater place and not far from there, only in this case.
The Affleck film misss a little dramatic tension, let him see with a moderate interest, appreciating the realization and the remote style of the 70s.
He leads the spectacular, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story, in a certain way that has been achieved this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services such as all powers and all citizens, it makes it.
Rules for smoking ballons, bananes and circles
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, who carried out a public research on the most absurd bank prices, has now decided to launch the concourse of the Regulation or ideas in the implementation of the "the EU academic".
"The fact that the EU reviews, these recent times, to adopt a quota of 40% of women for the direction of large European enterprises has been in the origin of our decision," said the Provo Journal, the organizator of this investigation, Patrik Naer.
In the absurdities mentioned, there is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unanimize the prices of insurance for men and women.
However, women were prevented for the life-security tariffs because they represent, objectively, a risk of risk for security companies.
People can notify to the end of the year any other incredible idea of "the EU's age".
"The vote will be placed before the end of February 2013," reported Naser.
For example, the obligation to add bio components to carburants, which have noiseable consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of use of the termometers to market, only because they contain a relatively low quantity of a dangerous substance or the Directive on the size of the eggs, which has provided the increase of the prices of the eating.
Criticals have also been issued by the past with the prohibition of use of the "training currency" or the retail of the sale of classic ampoules.
The quality bananes must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby which requirements are usually defenced in Brussels by a State or a group of States (as the Republic of the Czech Republic presently imposes the requirements of its banks in order to use its veto right).
The interests of the pressing groups are, for example, in the origin of the fact that in the Union, bananas should not be lower than 14 cm or present a "anormal curve".
The European Commission was defenced by saying that it was only harmonizing non-gogeneous national standards that complied with the trade.
The rules on fruit and flows have been applied unless the opposition of certain States, intended that existing Directives are intended to carry out food feeds.
The first price may be described in this investigation in the EU Regulation of the last year, according to which it must be found on the exploitable ballons, a warning that children of less than 8 years should not be smoked without adult monitoring.
The EU has refered to an American investigation according to which the ballons are, among the games, the first cause of children's death by exhaustion.
A similar restriction is applied to children less than 14 years to suffer in feed thrones.
We also have weird ideas.
The following rule on European officials is sufficiently absurd: due to the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, every person with a official function in the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should, in place, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Let's Fair" association of liberal economists, the Bankoevpoplattky.com was called in this research, including certain absurds mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food product reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU has fixed maximum volumes for food product reserves that can be found on the territory of the Tschech Republic on the day of our EU adhesion.
The Czech Republic then exceeds, for example, the volumes fixed for fields in conservation and risk, in fact, a serious amendment.
The organisations of this investigation have made interesting the idea of paying money to certain countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea to agree a subvention to ask for subventions.
However, these ideas are not originary of Brussels but of Prague.
"The fact that you don't have the sea to hack us.
We will ask the European Union a reward." So, at August 2004, the Ministry of Agriculture in the Jaroslav Palas (CHSSD).
It said that, on the fact of our production of steel, and then to the "interventionists", the State was found with full stocks that he had to export later.
According to the Palace, the EU should have granted us million euros because the Czech Republic is far away from the ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech Request and organized a call of offers to build bottle in providing countries without maritime access.
The subventions for the obtainment of subventions were proposed to communities by the Minister of Local Development referred to by Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), which should, particularly, serve to edit subvention requests made by Brussels.
The EU states: "The strange rules are weird."
If the regulations often submit criteria in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts developed by the EU on regulation and improvement of the efficiency of the Union and in the area of its general development, are more eligible.
For example, according to experts, the problem of use of EU subventions for projects that have not absolutely been able to see with the strengthening of European integration, but they have been imposed by the Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, as well as other EU countries, fights in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (the end of which it does not always seem venture), is made of live emotions in the Czech.
If in the term of six years of battle against Germans and Austrians, the Czechs have defend successfully the name "Olomoucke tvarůžky" for the name "Tuzemische rum" that is remoting to us in the XIXst century, our producers have to replace it by the name "Tuzemak".
Only products based on canne sugar alcohol, not based on beauty sugar, can bring the rhum denomination.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, it is found today in a community of villages known as the Feta or the Gorgonzola, the massepain of Lübeck or du tambone de Parme, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarski solarary"), the Carpes de Pohorelice and de Trüboň (Pohorralic and Trüboniski Capr) and the zhuble of Žatec ("Cheatecky chmel").
The bread of pardubice (Pardbunic Pernik) and the gatelets called "Cornets de Hourice " ("Horriical trubičky") can also be feeders of their Community mark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm not only a Amateur, the Senator of Okamura.
Mr Senator, how did the idea of presenting the President's elections?
It's not a senator or president who counts for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I wouldn't be candidated any part.
But I don't support to see how the country has been packed since these 20 years, that the flowers are not under the weights and the age of department to the retraite.
I had no ambition to become political.
But when I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to make a solution to change it.
And as I have more than 40 years and I am independent, no member of any part, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than to present me to the presidential or senatorial elections.
You have entered the Senat, but you are quickly set up for the Chateau (N.D.T.: Seat of the President).
Doesn't you turn the dust to those who have chosen you?
I always said I'll start in the war for the Chateau according to the results of the Senatorial elections
On the other hand, I decided that if I was a senator, I would present the President's elections.
My purpose is not the function, but this is just a tool that allows me to realize my vision.
That's why I need the greatest and the largest mandate.
The problem is not just as a nation rounds us in the bar or before our television position, but we also take a piece of those who try to bring changes.
It is added to the pressure that cut off the reputation of persons and confunded freedom of word with freedom to lie.
We, for example, told me that I suffer the journalists or I was the advice of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have made the fight for the Chateau with as a horse of battle the subjects of the material and penalty responsibility of politicians and retroactive fiscal declarations for 20 million [CZK].
You have to change the law at this end.
As President, you don't have such powers and only the Senat in his assembly can propose laws.
How do you want to resolve this problem?
When as citizens, I have pressed the tourist guide activities to be a liberal profession, I have received reasons.
The problem is the policy: when someone comes from the left or right with a good project, it is clearly refused and it's the citizens.
As independent, member of no party, I have much more chances to get the support of all Parliamentary parties.
I have the improvement of power, without category and dogma partisans, to take from every party what is better for our country and to apply it.
Do you think it's like a right or left man?
In a chec view, I have the impression that people put me on the left.
For me, that it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, it's important that we're going before.
That's not that people are left or right but collecting people.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the communist or ODS party, and I do even in the case of bad ideas.
Did you miss when someone says about you you are a popular?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get close to you.
Some can call it from the population, but all the proposals I speak have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken.
But without support of the Parliament, it remains only slogans.
You will not survive long in political with this.
Do you think if you're going to see people and talk to them, will you, for example, make material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have another option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinions and try to raise them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I was elected by the President, it would not be a problem to re-transmit directly to the television, my request to the Presidents of the Parliamentary Parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and procureurs.
They should then explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to press the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President to direct suffering, it has been obtained by the pressure of the public opinion.
I'm supposed to be an amateur, not a genius or a intellectual.
I'm trying to find associations for my opinions and visions.
I came to launch in policy, and I tried to get the support of the majority for my programme.
I'm trying only to prevent things, and if it's not going, I'll stop in six years and I'll return to the private sector.
It's a little like Okamaura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one can't do the difference, so I'm going to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves also to the senatorial elections.
I met Radim Janczura, but he refused because of the quantity of work.
I am at least supporting the journalist of the investigation of Jana Lorencova who declared the frauds in the museum.
I'm present because people are really bad but now I'm hesitated.
60 percent of people have not voted and what they have done, for most, have given their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In Senat, we're only two independent.
People have chosen a Senat that can hardly impose changes.
Instead, I will fight for my view, for example, the election to direct suffering of the mariners and the prefects of regions.
Would you like to fund your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is without tach and then I have no financial means.
I have no more money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my account "transparent".
You don't have money?
You're talking about fiscal statements, what's your?
I love about 60 million of my personal goods.
I have a country of $25 million, a apartment of a 10 million, another apartment value 8 million, a collection of works of art value of about 10 million, a Aston Martin, which is 3,5 million and a Scoda Superb of a value of 1 million and a few million on my account.
I said in the past, I have a Aston Martin, because it was a kid dream: I always loved James Bond, who walked in the car, was playing with women and fighting against evil and abus.
You walk in Aston Martin, you have a patrimoine of $60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but don't you want to invest your own money?
It's not very convinced.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Do I have to end up?
I've already invested 2 million and half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows good that my programme does not exceed a great interest.
I don't have the obligation to pay this campaign of my pocket.
My campaign costs are globally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live, for example, to pay the English school of my son who costs 30 thousand per month.
If my only objective was to win money, I wouldn't have any choice.
So you're going to continue your commercial activities to live?
Didn't you tell you that you're going to put your activities in a sudden place?
But this is not linked to the quantity of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partly reduced my activities.
For example, my advice will take the direction of the travel agency.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who save the Republic.
But I have to live in something.
What was your normal month payment when you were a businessman?
I won and I continued to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was President, I would have finished my business activities.
You will find this interview in the editing Saturday of Prava Journal.
MVRDV architects prove that real avenues are not only imagination. To convince it, it is enough to look at Spiijkenice and the mount of books newly raised - 2 photos
"I find that this building is married, it makes very future, finally something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a traveling on the bottom of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a large neighbour company, said, "Yes, it's really beautiful, this building."
But I ask why we still need a library today.
Everyone is online, a iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes from his full grace in one of these ringard libraries, isn't it?
Spickenice, a village town that doesn't have anything at Rotterdam's gates, contains a very particular record.
The community of 80,000 souls shows the less education rate of the Netherlands.
In order to reduce several neurones to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to play the seven fictical points that are found on the euro ballets under the form of small miniatures in armed beton.
The success of the cultural offensive has been limited.
That is how the authorities of the city have been considered that there was only one way to take the hand on statistics: the building of a library!
Winy Maas, of the Rotterdam MVRDV architect office, master of audacies and a creator of full spirit and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its normal flog and presented in 2003 with five books under his hands and a refuge on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at, disobedienced and heavy, Maas, the front, emphasized his books of choice by order to make a pyramid, and completed his stated talk of active arguments by one: "Common love!"
Here's my proposal for the Mount of Speijkenisse, or as it says, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mount of 30 million euros has a ground jail.
The building is included in a project of revitalisation containing also a subterrane parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few middle buildings and homes for a total of 50 rooms.
In the beginning of November, the mount of books received the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
Furthermore, the project was chosen for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
It is so that this small terner bourgate, which was not yet to offer but a post-moderne pioneer area and a maria of a humidant laiders, which the white faces invited to think that they open a latery, has been raised by a contemporary architectural work.
The most important, is that Spiijkenisse now has the first public cultural building of his history.
The long path to play
First pressure: Eldorado of the book under rubber.
Certainly, a ascensor brings you to the heart of the massif, but the real joy of reading and architecture opens to you when you spread the ground of the building to its topography.
The entirely made of glass is light and clear, the air in Holland bricks and elegante reverbs speak without switching the language of municipal public places.
The city atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public banks, dogs and kids and girls who play the ball.
And part of all books, books and books.
"Normally, library ratios are the longness of the facial and in the middle is a large and dark room, which often is incompatible and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely built the classic space configuration and opened the internal reading spaces to the outside.
The inside of the mount of books has been advertised: in the middle of the offices, the Internet library, the missing club, the centre for the environment and the technical centre of the building.
A particular beauty resides in the black rays of the library, which are often lambs, too much ballares, soon scale ramps.
A new experience for view, touching it and opor.
Even architects and engineers of the endurised building do not want unknown materials.
"We want to work with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, leader of the project at the Skykenise community, in an answer to the Standard.
It is so that a day we found in a agricultural business a disagreement ad hoc issu of agriculture.
In the Netherlands, it is used since years of the synthetic memorandum of a milimeter of space as substrated in the seres and fields.
It's a good market and we win time.
Membrane end is used for one or two inches, then we can throw it.
For the library, the memorandum has been compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in places of a range of four centimeters.
Under the effect of the challenge and pressure, the "Landbuilding Plastic" (KPL) changes color and changes into a dark, homogene and resident material, which the oor is called once a new car and sport sport chausures.
On the top of 105 marches, the mountain's summary is found.
At about 500 meters, the literary coffee offers us an immense view on the city, but also Holland croquets and ficus in pots.
These lasts create a atmosphere, but especially contribute to maintain the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain.
A gift for the new soul
"It's incredible, but, although all the surfaces of glass, this building is a model project on the ecology," trusts Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermy.
What the mount of books is located below a glass cloche, the sun lights only a little while inside, even the beautiful days.
The springs of woods mounted by traveling in relation to the fascinate of seed serves par-soil, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The environmental atmosphere is very pleasant.
Full-automated stores are loaded from the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the seventh informant, has already risked to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already here.
Cynthia Bourde, Chinese traditional medicine teacher, also describes the Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spiijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to give a book issu of his personal library.
This measure allowed to compile the empty library that was not yet completely amazing (or today, it counts 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rayons are out of all parts.
For the Winy Maas Architect, "There's nothing worse than a half empty library."
"I believe our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
So MVRDV has achieved the master discipline called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of a identity."
Spickensis wrote a new letter history page.
Even if she can be young and little educated.
It is finally a new department point for the birth of a identity.
Szabo: "The Germans have to play a greater role."
Germany chose the absence in vote on the admission of Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert of relations between the United States and the EU, this decision made Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of Palestinians to obtain the State of observer to the United Nations.
But then she chose the absence.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approval what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Berlin needs to prove proof, because it involves special relations with Israel.
But I also think she doesn't support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, however, not to show too critical to Israel.
During the insurrection in Liberia of March 2011, Germany also chose the absence in vote on the implementation of a air exclusion area.
Finally, the OTAN sets this measure.
Does Germany experience difficulties to take a clear position on great international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is trying to review his external policy, looking forward to a policy to say that the Americans are defined and to establish a German external policy.
Furthermore, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union is full of the situation.
Therefore, Germans are in several fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not habited there.
I think they are still taking to find this role, but they are on the way of an alien policy "normal".
A external policy, such as in France or in British
What is then particularly the term of "normal" for Germans?
It shows the desire to adopt independent positions of the United States and European partners, including in respect of national documents.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or East.
The German economic interests are, in a certain way, different from the other great powers: therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position of Germany in respect of the conflict in the East and the absence in the vote of the United Nations?
Germany first moved significantly in the Province-East, especially in the Golf countries.
That is why Berlin should be kept not to prevent public opinions, but also the electorals of the Arab countries.
There is no doubt of a determinant element.
However, I would not give it too important because it is not exclusively unique relationship.
But there is a element that determines in German strategic reflections.
Is German night with its relations with the United States by choosing the absence in important votes, such as in Palestinian case?
I think the Europeans and the Americans are perfectly understanding the German position.
That's why I think the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libanon question.
Perhaps even Germany will only be respected.
In fact, Germany has shown that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests should be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions on Palestinian initiative are different.
In contrast, the United States announced their vote of a clear voice.
Did the opinions differences between the United States and the majority of the European countries?
There are always various differences because of the U.S. internal policy scene.
I believe that Obama Administration makes secretly evidence of a great understanding against the European position.
However, seeing the political configuration of the country, the government can not hear its position publicly.
I think the real difference of thinking is not so big as they always look like it.
If you observe the relations between Obama and the first Israeli Ministry of Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from disagree with Netanyahou's policy.
Does Germany experience difficulties to conciliate its extreme relations with Israel and the United States, on one hand, with the position of the large European partners, on the other hand?
I think it's not easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little more simpler for Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not the case.
They can't enter into a larger policy line and should indicate their individual position.
That's what they're doing in the question of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will attach a role of location to the future and will take Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicated.
But according to me, the Germans are well known that they must play a role that makes more independence.
Does Germany see play a role of pest actor on the international scene, does Germany only want to assume a key role?
Or have she always difficulties to take part of the first plan?
The Germany is not still habited, it is still incompatible and, for clear reasons, the country always tries difficulties to play a more important role.
If we look at it, for example, the euro's crisis, we are noted that every time Germany decides to do more, many anti- German feelings are hearing.
It's not easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is still the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded from hostile countries.
In this regard, Germany is in a better delicate position than the United States.
She must compound with neighbors and very different opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on the European policy is just reducing, but in this time, the EU does not combine this empty, then who remains?
The Germans should just play a more important role.
And even if it doesn't like them, even if it's disappointable to them, and if they're less favorable, it's life!

"Protection of Marks" in China: when Puma and Armani become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known marks throughout the world.
Armani Polo... What is it really about?
After this name, an officially located mark is hidden in China, but there is nothing to see with the original enterprise.
The Market plays a protection such as the undertaking that takes the name may not be clear.
And even if she could, it's not sure she would get a reason.
"It's more difficult for strangers to protect their marks in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the Taylor Wessing campaign specialized in violation of the right of property in Extrême-East.
Every week, a new folder comes on my office.
The imitators only need some additional letters to record their marks.
So, instead of Gucci, we are recorded Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we are recorded Prada-Kny.
German companies also copy in all legality, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sport articles.
Pattloch opens a classroom where the records made at the office of Pekin's Marks.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company posted the Zegna DF Puma mark, a name that the firm was artificially created by applying a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the mode house.
It is a real fact that the Chineses became the world's fields of copy and violation of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are commercial centres at several stages that are practically sold only controversy.
However, the cases of Pattloch are different: his mandaters are carried out to attack the fact that the Chinese mark office officially trusts Chinese enterprises the right to use a name already protected in another country.
The Chineses are talking about "Bang Mingpai".
The term is described by "Bang Dakuan".
This is the term that women married with rich men are designed.
The Chinese authorities say that there is nothing to approach.
"It's bad for business, we need to fight this tendency," requires Pattloch.
"The mark is edified, the singularity is disappeared, the debts for the reputation are great."
Financial losses and jurisdiction costs are in millions for the relevant sectors, especially in the respect of cost market products.
According to the CLSA market analysis data, China represents an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market of luxury products and the most rapidly developed.
However, it is not easy to raise the duplicate records of the mark record and these procedures are delighted.
These lasts can stay until nine years, and it's never sure.
Pattloch made a state of procedures when the court rejected the state, because after a long period, the critical name was become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains us that if the plagueman has no chance, it may even be obligated to get money to the plague, because he would have night at his mark in China.
In this area, sometimes it is the law of the jungle who dominates.
Favourite cases are also related to graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the Cantier Machine Builder Sany, the same company that came to rake the manufacturer of pumps in Beton Putzmeister.
That's why Chinese can use an emblem like Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's acquisitor, used before a blue and white logo that remembered the BMW. The conflict was regulated and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste mode house was lost against Hong Kong and Singapur's plagiers who had reoriented the view of the crocodile celebration in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of nothing.
The CTMO mark office in Pekin admits, however, to have known several difficulties in 2010 because of a missing personal and space.
However, the office would have past the last year of an "urgency situation in the deployment of the work on a normality found."
Thus, the number of non-treated opposition procedures would be decreased by 22%.
Before 57,000 cases of this type would be closed, which represents a increase of 75% in relation to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain suffering in the office.
Acquire Cost
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year, the CTMO received more than 1,4 million mark deposits, almost one third of more than 2010.
According to the office, it is a record and that means that China is the tenth consecutive in the head of the classation for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also be for the total number of legal marks, which is 5,5 million.
In 2011, the office would have calculated 1,8 billion yuan inscription law.
In other terms, each record reported in average 1,280 euros, or 160 euros.
A juridical battle costs much more, as it is illustrating the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
Since more than seven years, the company was fighting against a Chinese plague.
Of course, Germans could have obtained the illegal manufacture of vehicle components.
However, the immigrant could maintain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg mark.
"It is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, President of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Mark Office was therefore denied the objection of the Munichos.
Freudenberg has received certain reasons to the following two instances, but the adverse party continues to fight until today.
Monitoring is setting
Today, the case is in instance at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive issue of the process and is worth the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, testing, and we cost a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The archive service has even been reviewing the acts of the last hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed a "great sum in euros to six digits" to regulate the ligue.
"This is why we see what this represents for us," trusts Wentzler.
The East-East dangers even throw up into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators of this region would ensure the exploitation of non-protection marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit the name of Freudenberg in Germany for a cheap production and cooking company.
The company had been left this sector for a long time, but she could even stop the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "The monitoring is a mission."
Pattloch and him advise to German companies to prove a great property in their trade relations with China.
It is not sufficient, according to them, to respect the international right of marks, the strangers should at least "registre all things that can be protected in China" as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, costs may be more important than those of the recording.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drame, the company should pay licence rights to the contrary part for the use of its own name, such as Wentzler.
Or then, we will lose our place on the segment of the market concerned.
World Day of fight against the side: football, singer, help
The Imbongi carrier repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphelins of Swaziland rejoice from their coming.
This is the story of a link that franks more than a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
First, we're cutting the feet: cowboy bottles, baskets, scarpins for ladies and mossasins are looking for the rithma by shopping the footground.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the songs are leading - high, low, dark and soprano - they bring, send and follow.
Fiet Hop, the chief of the orchester of 29 years almost lost his shoes of steel when he leads the orchester with his gestures of a savage supply.
We're lunch evening, the Imboni carrier repeats a new song in the music office of the Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute.
Fifty songs and songs from 23 to 69 years have come from human medicine in the family.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple track, each chlorist has different words, the whole in a very exotic language: the Zelu, a language speaking by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some Swaziland regions.
Aid to help
UNIDA, the United Nations Fund Programme, estimates that 34 million people throughout the world are achieved from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland counts 245,000 infected persons.
Furthermore, more than 40% of the population is seropositive.
180 orphelins of the village of Estheni found marriages in Germany through the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them frequencies are a secondary education institution.
For 15 or 20 euros at least, we can become parent.
This sum is guaranteed to the child of money for school, a school uniform and a hot diary food in the Gogo centre.
Imbongi means in Zelu "histor of story" or even "Luunges song".
Nobody can soon speak the bankued language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
Since about 10 years, the choral repeats the songs in this strange language that she brought to Germany for now to bring it to her birthday region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometres aeroplane from Heidelberg, north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, the village depends on the vocal power of the German choral.
40% of achieved persons
The village counts about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in steel or ground modestes, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphelins, because HIV has brought their parents.
In Esitgeni, we can observe the worst scale that acquire Swaziland: the highest infection rates in HIV and the latest hope of life in the world according to UNICEF.
The population does not practically accept masculin circumcision, a measure that guarantees a reduction of the risk of half infection.
Over 40% of the Swaziland population is carried out of immunodeficiency virus, and it is not amazing to die in the middle of the 30th.
In a group traveling in Africa to the presumps 2005, Imbongians have seen many children in the street where it was not only parents, but also just all: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without school diploma, there is no perspective.
In the beginning, it was only a few persons who were personally engaged in paying a few euros each year to help a child to school and to offer him a hot food day.
But at the end of a year later, the choral founded "Voices for Africa", a association that has been occupied from at least professional ways of the orphelins of the site of Estoni.
Infections relating to sexually transmissible infections
What are sexually transmissible diseases?
In the middle of the bacterians, the syphilis, the chlamdides and the blennoragie (or gonorrhee).
Curant ISTs are HIV, human pavillon virus, genital heroes or hepatitis.
Pubs and galles are parasitors.
What are the mainly concerned groups?
The syphilis and the blennorrhegies are often apparent to men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute considers that sexual contacts between men are in the origin of at least four cases of siphilis on five stated in Germany.
In heroesexual adults, the infections related to chlamidides, trichomonase, candidate (fongical), blennoragie and human papillum virus are sexually transmissible.
The proportion of HIVs between heroesexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, about 20% of the new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In the young ones, a level of infections related to chlamdides is sensitively higher than in other population groups.
According to the European relevance, the three quartes of all infections are concerned with the young ones of 15 to 25 years.
Furthermore, in Germany, the human pavillon virus is running in young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not obligated to declare all sexually transmissible diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has been more than duplicated in 10 years: the number has passed from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new infections in HIV reduced.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of a decade in relation to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infected diseases can cause abuses at the level of genetic bodies, urinary pains, white losses, painters in the low wind and the appearance of bottoms and brushes.
However, they are not regularly training any pain or other symptoms and remain hidden.
How to protect you?
Preservatives can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that the pathogene agents of sexually transmissible diseases can also be transmitted by gorgeous infection or by extreme body contacts.
Experts therefore recommend any person who often changes sexual partners to regularly travel examinations.
Most of the rapidly deposited ISs can be healthy and the age of the late can be exited.
Thanks to the parengers, the donations, but especially the funds of the crossists collect by their voice throughout Germany, the means are accumulated.
"Now, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitgeni," estimated Annette Lennartz, President of the Association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman who always gets what she wants, leads the money of Germany.
She also ensures that orphelins are well logged, in one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, as well as the old women in Zelu, are the pillers of the village.
Some of them achieve to 14 orphelins, they offer a tooth and make sure that they get each day at school in their uniforms.
The orphelin who has no more person is busy in a certain place, in Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as both cookins who preserve food every day for more than 200 children.
Furthermore, "Voices for Africa" created a cooling school and allowed the construction of two poolers. With the concourse of the American organization for the PSI health, the association organized an HIV depth test for many inhabitants.
This doesn't go away, for even if the disease is very visible in all the country, it remains a tabu subject.
A King and his 14 wives
"The sida is a real tabu," explains Annette Lennartz, "for it is a subject that touchs sexuality."
It's enough curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
These sanctions of the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid propagation of the HIV observed these last decades.
Migrant workers also have disrupted the virus through the country.
However, there are stores at each street road, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to improve a little of the cultural change, Imbongi chlorists share together both or three years in South Africa, and intend to be fulfilled of nostalgies, courage, trust and identity as a number of inhabitants of the Black Continent point still know the time of the apartheid.
The white bus full of whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition, as it generates not only good humor and joy, but sometimes also rolls a larm to some redoutable border guards.
The bus always brings them to Esitgeni, where the chlorists are visiting their daughters.
Even if it is difficult to find the small village on a card, Esitgeni is well known in the Valley of Esulveni.
"Go to Esitgeni, you'll find the light," say the people there.
And after a travel of 8,733 miles of bird fly, back to Heidelberg, before those chlorists who stick from the feet in the repeat room of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find light.
Messaging: NASA finds the presence of glass on Mercure
The Messagger has reported evidence of the existence of glass on the Mercury Planet.
The glass layer could get 20 meters of spacer.
NASA Spatial Agency proved glass existence on the Mercure Planet.
Although this planet is the nearest of the Solar, it covers green water, as it explains three studies published in the specialised "Science".
The Messenger has reported evidence of the existence of a glass covering in the area of the planet permanently blown in the shadow.
This covering would have a range of at least 30 centimeters that could go to 20 meters.
The water is probably produced from comités or may be asteroids that would have herd Mercure.
However, no one is linked between water discovery and hypothesis of an existence of life on the planet, explains the scientist in the head of the Sunday Messager, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercure can get 426 degrees of Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how the water and other essential elements have arrived in other areas of the sun system.
Invisible people of our planet, sounds, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix explored the depths of the universe.
From time to others, they sent images to the earth, such as small interstitions through which the unfinite is observed.
The image produces a photographic device developed by German researchers of the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our sunsystem, and the Nanny Planet Cersei.
As Pluton, which orbites around the Neptune Solar, Cersei is not considered as a "planet" according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This details of a infrared photography taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of the unnamed star generations: the oldest stars are blue and the red, more difficult to identify, are the "new-new" in the universe's room.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars were born, baptized "W5", a very little romantic name, in Cashiopée's constellation, at 6,500 light years.
The Spitzer telescope of the NASA photographed the flamboyant ice of a star training to die.
The beaching circle is composed of elements that the star projected when she dies.
In the large Nebulous Trifide, at 5.400 light years of the Earth, the gas and the gas form of new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galaxy room.
The Pleiades, star loves also called "the seven sisters", can be observed at the nine eye during the night.
However, the telescope makes more colors in value.
On this infrared photo, Helise's nebulous, as a red eye, look directly on the spectator.
She is located at 700 light years in the Constellation of the Verseau.
His comparisons with a earthquake continent valued him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photos and infrared photos allows to watch a spectacular teeth.
Only the Spitzer telescope infraround detectors could capture a image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the largest enigmas of the astronomy is on the creation of Saturn annals.
A theory is that the annuals are the rest of a Saturne Month that lost 4,5 billion years ago without left traces.
One of the largest and beautiful photographies that had taken the Hubble telescope is the galaxy of Tourbillon.
According to the darkness, the photographies of spiral galaxy can become real art works.
The photography published by the European Australian Observatory shows the trifide nebulous in the constellation of the Sagittar, a number of thousands of light years.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divised, divided in three), because three pool trained divide the heart from the born place of stars.
Astronomes have photographed the primates of a cosmic carbone in the Serpentaire's constellation: at 400 million light years of the Earth, the eggs of two infusion galaxies are exceeding one to another, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like the technical abbreviations, you can use its name of "a South Fire Road".
The photo of Hubble Spatial Telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebulous in the constellation of Cephae.
The nebulous is located at 1,400 light years and is composed of pool grains that are ten to hundred times smaller than the current household poussière.
This photo has been developed from optic and radiographic clicks taken by various telescopes.
We can see the cycle composed of black branches that are at 430 million light years of the Earth.
The spatial telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies baptized Arp 273.
The scientists called the greatest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebulous, the youngest star group is the most lightest way of our lacked way.
The heavenly herd always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are linked by Rosette's nebulous, also create young stars at 5000 light years of the Earth.
In this galaxy to light radians and perceived by a small black steel, there is no gas yet, there is no gas.
The scientists think that he was born a little after the bigbang, when the universe was composed in a large part of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would be invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to observe the stars.
Afterward, the spectrums of the optic telescopes did not stop growing and thanks to them, it was possible to see the universe still far away.
In 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Telescope Hale of the Observatory Mount Palomar near San Diego was the largest telescope of the world.
The viewer on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope is found.
He allows to observe the universe through two mirrors with each diameter of 8,4 meters.
The wind of the Grand Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is great. The looking at him only gets a diameter of 10,4 meters.
The spectrum of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa was segmented to make economys.
The diameter gets all the same about 11 meters.
The incompatibility of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which is limited to the mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
His particularity holds its great light collection capacity.
Despite a diameter of relatively small looking, this capacity is close to the largest telescopes in the world's mirrors.
Scientifics listen to the universe to search for extra-terrestre signals using the Arecibo radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any owner of a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI or "Search for extra-terrestre intelligence") by contributing to the calculation of its machine.
See the Australian European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("the great telescope"), a valid installation of his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can light the average infraround spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also provided for the ESO website in Chile.
His main mirror should achieve the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed about 1,000 mirrories elements.
However, the telescope could not take clicks before 2018 at the past.
Before 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcan of Mauna Kea were considered as the largest world.
They treated two mirrors from a diameter of 10 meters every one.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observer that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of his miroir will be 30 meters.
This illustration allows him to admire.
However, the most important space images are from Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he delivered us pictures from the farmers.
Since March 2009, the Spatial Telescope Kepler looks for exoplanets, especially those who are inhabitants.
The NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that she found 1,235 candidates from the beginning of the mission.
This photo explains the last preparations before Kepler starting the spatial telescope.
The spatial telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent in the space at least 2018 at an Ariane 5.
The first viewer of the infraround space telescope has a diameter of 6,5 meters.
The telescope will be particularly for mission to find the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
The scientists think that the South Mercure Pool also opens the glass.
However, there is no faithful data on this theory, because the Messaging is more than the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data indicated the presence of glass on Mercur since decades.
By the launch of the Song Messager in 2004, the first to organize around Mercury, scientists now have confidence.
Drink each day from the beer, and live until 168 years
In the South Azerbaijan, many people have dignity ages of the Bible patriarchs.
We've even found a long-evitable museum.
A research on a country in which we still are relatively young to 97 years.
In the South Azerbaijan, many people have dignity ages of the Bible patriarchs.
We've even found a long-evitable museum.
A research on a country in which we still are relatively young to 97 years.
The traveling in the Talysh mountains is a false romantic.
On the bottom of many tours of the road, the small bus caught the length of broken collines, tower rivers and modest ferms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we're here in the South Azerbaidjan Depth, the border with Iran is only a few miles.
This is where the ethnic catacasian group of the name of Talysh, about which we don't know big-hose, if they speak perfectly the Persan and the Aser, and they have a very long-term long-term.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small city with its architecture is too aggressive of the Soviet Time that does not agree with the landing of Pittorical mountains.
The European tourists are weird here, the trait from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is very painful.
We need eight hours to travel 323 kilometers, because the road is only one way.
The Province has not yet benefited of the legal riches that the country has to reserve in the Caspine Sea.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva, 48 years, is surprised that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Bakou has been celebrated in May by the concorrence of the Eurovision, and the next year, there will be the festival of the older people of the world," explains Fatulayeva.
It's a director of the long-evited museum, the only museum of the world.
We can discover the life of about eight decades of Talysh region that have more than 100 years. Fatulayee shows us a black and white photo.
Here's my grandfather, he got 120 years old.
Have a child more than 136 years
But the controversed star of the museum is Shirali Moslumov, a shepherd who had 168 years.
However, there is no born act.
And when we think that the oldest person was 122 years old, the age of Muslumov seems more dure.
"He was born in 125 in this region, he was dead in 1973," precise Fatulayeva.
The man would be married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Will Shirali Muslumov be thrown a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Schulz, gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard about the man in the great age of Central Asia.
"There are also in some regions of China, Japan, or in the Valley of Hunza in Pakistan," explains Schulz, "in Sardaigne also, there are men who live incrediblely older."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the injection of documents, without counting that there was no civil state record.
Each day, a based bird
However, it is actually that Lerik’s region people often attend a age of the Bible’s patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
So what is the reason for long-term in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerian tourist guide, explains that Talysh has special gens.
In contrast, Fatulayeva, the museum's direction, thinks that it's a question of food.
However, it doesn't seem pleasant, of an nutritional view, that the rich foods in the Talysh calories, which love the flesh, the bread, and especially the latiar products, and which many drink each day a based beer, are good for health.
Or is it the simple life mode that keeps the youngness of people? In Cenheimiran, a small village near Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who says that he has 143 descendants, lives in a modest tree house, as it is typical to see it in all the regions of Caucase.
She's sitting on the ground near a barate, whose content is unlassable.
Eight people live here under a single tooth, among which one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a girl who are adults for a long time.
Two little kids also play in the house.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for invitations served in typical horses of wind form.
The white dents of Mirzayeva are perfectly equipped, and under his fould hiding long threats of a blond that his son reveals us with honour.
I've always laid my hair with the lake, and that's how I've never lost them and they have kept their color.
"I've never used shampooing," added Mirzayeva.
The month retrait is enough to live
She has always eaten that which produces from her own silver: tomates, grounds, and small fishes.
From all my life, I never bought the moon food in a supermarket.
Then she talks to us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments have been after the Second World War.
But everything has been improved when the "beloved father" Heidar Alyev takes the commands.
The language of the strange propaganda in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the nation's parental figure, a man who still guided his country as a dictator, did not know nearly limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded with him.
Whatever, the older people in Azerbaijan don't know the threat.
Mirzayeva received a monthly 230 manats (in the same sum of euros) for its retreat, a sum that guarantees a good train of life in the region.
And perhaps the son of Mirzayeva's grievous son has said, "The elders play a great respect in our culture."
They're the center of the great family, they're loved, happy and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "Home Rights" in the Constitution
Revolution renews the Caire.
Rival statements reflect the deep fracture of the country.
The draft constitution based on the chair is violated.
The President of Egypt is not avoided word of emotions.
We have to succeed the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said to the State TV.
His talk was destined to all the people, but also in particular to the Christian Courts, to the Liberal, the Muslims lighted and laying.
Because all members of the confused and disappeared opposition are afraid.
They're afraid of a teocracy on the Nil in the hands of the mighty Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost excusing, to have temporarily restricted the competences of the Constitutional Court and extend his "some to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world don't really know what he wants to save this engineer of 61 years, titular of a doctor of an American University in South California.
Does the judicial power be turned back?
The 234 articles listed to the challenge by the Congregation that constitute mostly islamic of 100 people in an evening force of 15 hours are very concerned in a certain measure.
As in the previous constitutions, the draft proposes that the jurisprudence is "the principles of the Islamic Law".
But what does the word "principes" really mean?
It was, and it remains still a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that the Islamists use the vague formulation and the margin of legal work that is deceived to apply a stricter interpretation of the charia.
In all cases, it is to make a new article introducing that, in regard to all the subjects involved in the charia, the Al-Azhar university must be consulted. The establishment is the most important islamic institution of the country and its rayon eclat on all the sun-islamic islamic world.
This may, but it does not mean strongly that the church will monitor the legislative device, which would actually take into account the implementation of the judicial power.
Many points of the Constitution Project are to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the probable maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the kingdom of Moubarak, these courts used to repair the opposers.
After the challenge of the director, to 11,000 citizens were arrested by the military.
The State also needs to read in the project, protect "the real nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its moral and its values".
In a legal view, the formulation is so weak that State institutions can even control the content of the art and literature.
Of course, it would just be censury.
Furthermore, no article does expressly guarantee the equality between men and women.
Instead, another article has been prohibited to open or divide the prophet Mahomet or his messengers.
In contrast, the article does not define what is a crime or how it should be punished.
It is too doubtful that the formulation is to hear that it is prohibited to "avoid people."
Is it able to draw a caricature of the President or to tell a blague on the destruction of a law man?
Therefore, many points are to interpret the project that Morsi submits to the vote and who, according to his own words, will make the object of a reference to the Egyptians.
"Revolution Revolution"
The opposition is mobilised for weeks against the digital highest of the Islamists.
Wednesday, hundreds of thousands of manifestants were gathered together in a normal concord on the place of Tahrir in Cire, promised to fall the chair before it enters into force.
"The revolution renews and we will win," Law Hamdin Sabbahi, has arrived third to the presidential elections.
The Nobel price of the international peace and ex-head of the International Agency of the Atomic Energy Mohamed El Baradei stated that the Constitution project was "to throw into the pools of the history."
On Twitter, the instant mail service, he accused Morsi's participants to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we're going to his palace and we'll turn it back," cried Jasser Said, an opposer.
"We are not yet fatigued, our brothers' blood is not yet exposed," said the Egyptian Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
Furthermore, many judges have announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would be incredible.
"The Coran is our Constitution."
From its side, the Muslim, well organized, called a contra-manifestation not on the place of Tahrir by precaution, but on the other river of the Nil, where a great prayer was organized before the University of the Caire.
The wives and the party of the salaphists, who participated in many, scanded: "The people claimed the implementation of God's law."
"Let our country!" they asked to Morsi, saying, "The Coran was their constitution."
A fight for the sovereignty on the symbolic place of Thar, where it begins, would be quickly built a situation like a civil war.
Of course, the party of Morsi wanted to disappear.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opposers to the Constitution project, at the same time as its parties, were expressed high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to leave the people to decide by the urgent direction that the country should take.
The project of Islamists will certainly be the majority.
"The human rights are not mentioned one time."
Hafez Abu Saeda is in anger against this constitutional process imposed that would have been extended to February and all social forces.
The lawyer of the human rights of 48 years and President of the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the courts under Mouarak.
He did not because he shared their concept of the world, but because human rights are invisible for him.
That's why he's been carried out, judged and undertaking.
"And now, the term has not even been spoken once in the new Constitution," said he during his treatment with the world am Suntag.
The extension of the powers of Morsi to three powers denied the lawyer.
These measures are cried on the rules of democracy, and they will generate a new dictature in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President takes him in fact all its powers," said Saeda.
However, a democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels disappointed, including the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideals on the border of Nil with a measure of interest and nervousness.
This could be paid.
A manifestant on Thar's place says: "You'll take a monster that it's not possible to control you."
The rakfisk of Norway: Is this the most happy fish of the world?
The five million people who people in Norway benefit from one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country be linked to the local appetite for a extremely hate fish?
Take advanced shoes.
Place them in the middle of a pile of moiled foot and sales.
Wait a week.
And you get the deranged oor of rakfisk, one of the most captured metes of Norway.
I'm in the small city of Fagernes, about 3 hours of Oslo.
Snow, landscape is spectacular - and this worm, overwhelming, pressing air.
The rakfisk is composed of saudo-soil triite and fermented in the water for a long time - according to the oor you want to exhaust - who can go to a year.
When the darkness is installed and it makes frod, the Norwegians gather in mass to assist a festival here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible kulinary speciality.
"You eat faith, then you get a water green," explains Havard Halvarsen, along with the full time that it also is called "Rakfisk General", responsible for the festival management.
Besides us, people value small fishing pills and explore a large quantity of drinks.
"Some people prefered the water to rakfisk," added Havard.
The drink kills the worm.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can disappear it under your neck, it's not bad - it makes think of a suhi that would have passed long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk remote to a time when Norway was poor, before the refrigeration invention, the fish was cutting in airbarks, and then went into automne.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish went out and - no doubt with the feelings of alcohol - eating.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norways were forced to leave their countries to find a job, mainly migrant to the United States.
Now, the population is rapidly developed - more than 13% is immigrants, attached by full employment, high salaries and a full health system.
The Sweden, their old rivers in which the country was not so much rich than Norway, passed through the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered as something important, a vital element, although happy, from the past of Norway.
It's part of the lovingest platts.
But everything is sweet - a little bird pint or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each one.
Norway doesn't often talk about it in the international presents, which is not to exceed it.
Here, people are not ready to talk about Andres Brevik, the extremist racist of right who attacked 77 persons, among women and children.
When they call this murder, they're talking about "the accident of July 22."
Norwegians have bad to accept that one of them could make such a barbarian act in their peaceful country.
Since the beginning of the 70s, Norway has to have its riches to its petrolium and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But the pet is not the unique reason that justifies our success," explains Anna, our servant, the blonde hair, and the eyes of a transperceive blue, the image of the nordic goodness, with a rakfisk board in his hand.
We are - how you say - smart people.
His English, like the most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we don't like to notice.
Norway supported its petrolium riches with a lot of proudness - all, except a low percentage of money issue of this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries throw the money through windows, during the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept the cordons of its well-shared bourse.
"Which we can spread in winter and make the randon in it, we are happy," she precised.
"Sans forget the rakfisk," she added to an unsearchable ridiculous.
I'm standing under the snow, and I'll make the cow to buy what to eat -- I had my rackfisk dose.
In the menu, a hamburger composed of ice, a real discovery, is great.
But tonight, the fisheries of the fisheries are all around.
The hotel where I live is one of the many places where it serves rakfisk to meet and where it can vote for the best of them - or maybe for the most happy of them.
There is a TV emission where the presentator takes a nord-papillon, around rakfisk assets.
We would believe in the Eurovision competition.
"What score have you given to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"That's our points, Havard."
We hear ridiculous and apologizes.
A man's falling from his chair, maybe because of the await.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanagements.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Neto knows a hard department.
While the President enters Enrique Pena Neto is ready to take his functions in Mexico, Will Grant, from the BBC, is interested in the difficulties that expect him and the people's attendants, which are many.
Road circulation in Mexico is particularly bad at the present time.
In a city where the embouts are normally leading, a security barrier has been placed since lunch, locking several key road access in the capital and carrying a real chaos on the streets.
However, the objective was not to prevent people to get to their work, but to prevent the manifestants to attend the Parliament.
The next week, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Neto, will receive the presidential chair to become the new president of the nation's head.
A compliant task is waiting for.
Mexican economy is good, the results that the president must go out to Felipe Calderon, but the country is avoided to a drug war that has already costed life at about 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has committed an aggression to the Mexico people to reduce violence," said Mr. Pena Neto to the President of the United States Barack Obama in the Ovale Office a little later this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to get this goal.
Before the President of America, Mr. Pena Neto was Governor of Mexico.
A very poor and tempulary state that enters the capital. On his prediction land, the opinions on this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the buconic community of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The locals contribute to the development of tourism and infrastructures in the common.
To join the city, you can take one of the new authors of Mr. Pena Neto, a major improvement has been brought to these routes, formally bossed and full crows.
Places that tremble his name are across a new sport complex and an interactive interactive museum that is dedicated to climate change.
"Our accounts on him to place sustainable changes," said his friend and politician Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and part of Mr Pena Neto, the PRI.
In security and economic terms, in particular, we hope a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without power, the PRI was raised in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years, there are many expectations in the area of the Party on Enrique Pena Neto.
He refuses the critics of the opposers who calls to the new president to miss charism.
He's a whole man, very able, with a great vision of the country.
He's a great guy of State and, above all, he can listen.
However, it is not always the picture that people of their old governor have.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the pavilion streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the auto points of the authors, it constitutes a town of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also specific and cities.
Moreover in the year, military soldiers were called to requiring to fight drug gangs in the quarters, and the violence made to women are particularly serious.
In a remote area, the tens of women killed in the past two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico’s state when Mr. Pena Neto was governor, a higher rate than in the very violent city of Juarez - a seriously honourable place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Neto say that he has not succeeded to ensure the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was working.
In the worst, they accused their administration to refuse to see the reality in face.
In a beton house, typical of this dealing quarter, Irenaa Buendia fights to keep her laughs when she shows me pictures of her dealing daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version makes a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came home to her, he reminded me that her body was lake," said Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she was battled, and the body rigidity was already loved.
When her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana has the wall, near a cross where the word is found: Justice.
However, it is exactly what the family has seen to refuse.
The authorities have treated me as if I was an old manner, a failure of trouble, a pleasure.
They want us to accept what they say and keep silent.
"But it's not normal that there's so irregularity and obstacles," she said.
When President Pena Neto receives its sabate shipment, it will be fulfilled with a serious responsibility.
Thousands of thousands of families have been touched by crime in Mexico during the past six years and the new president promised that he would make its priority during his mandate.
"I hope that he will be so good as the President as if he was a governor," said Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, member of the Congress.
However, it is exactly that the families of the victims of Neza are the most afraid.
Bradley Manning wasn't clear of bad treatment, declaring the prosecutors.
Procurers try to contrary the maltratization revendications that Bradley Manning would have been victimed during the detention.
The process is on the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to category the cause that Manning's sequeration has been made in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused to have been destructed by thousands of confidential documents.
Procurers tried to demonstrate, Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused to be in the origin of the largest confidential information from the history of the U.S. Army -- has missed many occasions to declare evil treatment that he wished to have submitted in his military detention.
In an anti-intro-including with Manning, during a preliminary audience at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Deputy Maj. Ashden Fein stated that weekly visiting records made to Manning by officers during its nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, have not discovered any statement about his treatment.
The contra-intentionary - during a hearing, the defence has submitted a request that Manning case should be classified in the reason that the sequence has been made in very difficult conditions and has constituted a suffering suffering -- has been a day after Manning had tested his intention to suicide himself during his detention.
This analysis of military information, held in June 2010, was accused to destruct thousands of confidential documents during its service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the Friday audience, Fein examined the forms that the officers had finished after they met Manning, during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was submitted to a maximum carceral isolation of July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers issued questions to Manning and sent his answers.
When Fein called the forms, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment that he reserved his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in prison was globally "treaty professional".
The forms are not clear for bad treatment, although the officers had directly asked it about their carceral treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about some issues and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would be occupied, but they didn't consign the issues that they said.
"They have written "no problem" (after they have attached the concerns), and it does not mean that I hadn't taken problems," said Manning.
The Military Court Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he was not clear of his treatment in January 2011 with the special committee that was convinced to exclaim the suitable thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months ago.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change its restrictive state indicating a "function risk".
The military stated that they had assigned to him this restrictive state - a level under the survey closed for the risk of suicide -- for his protection and security of others.
"I wanted the person to know that I'd go well, and I wanted to take this statute to benefit from a better quality of life of my view," said Manning.
Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Koweït, where he was arrested for about two months before he was transferred to the military prison of the Sea Body to Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He declared that he was advised to murder himself when he was in Koweït and was disappeared once because of the challenge.
He added that the fact that he was not held at the moment of what he was going to happen to him or what happened in the rest of the world was very painful.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, in that cage," said Manning, Jeudi.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had the most clearest time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects that he had had were a material, a covering, tongs, clothing, and its lunettes.
He tried to stay in movement because sleeping or remaining long during the day was contrary to the Regulation.
Manning also stated that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, held outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he returned the night, they would wake him up to see his face.
Maning's lawyer made a formal statement for the treatment undertaken by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, April 2011.
The judge also made questions in Manning about a allégation reported in his Jeudi witness -- which after having been forced to sleep all night in his cell in Quantico, it was forced to hold down before the guards and others arrested one morning during the call.
Manning witnessed that at any time, he was not allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the questions of the judge, Friday, Manning said that he had declined from the order of his guard that he had to leave his covering that could hide his nudity, but he recognized that no one had commanded him to leave her.
Manning witnessed Jewish that he was forced to sleep last night, because he would have tried to prove a office that he was not a danger for himself.
Manning would have told the office that he could use his slip or his tongs to hurt, but he didn't do it.
This night, Maning witnessed that his sub-klets, his tongues, and his lunettes were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of the experiences that he lived during his detention and that he would fully reduce his judgment if he should be recognized by a martial court, a procedure that should be held at the beginning of the next year.
The Defence declared that Manning considers the less serious delays and to fight for the loss of other judicial charges too extremely.
The audience should be taken back this weekend, with prosecutors who should say that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagone confirmed that Manning was carried out in accordance with the Regulation that regulates the conditions of arrest of all arrests in Quantico.
Maning's accusation leaders include the flow of goods or public documents, counsel with the enemy, which provides the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all accusation leaders are held, the criminal reclusion will be perpetual.
My identity crisis mexico-American
He said that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the missing opportunities.
The Mexicans have tried to break those who went away; they remind Mexicans the difficult periods, he said.
Navarrette says that the Americans are taken between two worlds.
In a recent journey to Mexico, when I arrived in the hall, before douane and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for the "Mexicans" (Mexicans), one for the "Extrainers" ("Extrainers").
I stayed immobile for several seconds, I don't know what file I'm leaving.
I grew up in the center of California, where the Mexican called me all my life.
It's an ethnic quality, at the same time, as the one that my friends of Boston use when they say "Ireland" or my friends in New York when they say "Italians".
Then I became Mexican.
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that saw born my grandfather, no need of special quality or of union treatment.
I was just a American.
I speak Spanish enough to handle a treatment in one or another language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a bunch, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I directed to the "Exterrances".
I was thinking about this week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto visited President Obama, in the House-Blanche.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries met, their predetermination theme are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Neto was also intended to talk about the growth of Mexico economy, which is one of the reasons that the Mexicans could stay in Mexico instead of risking in the United States.
He wants to go to the United States and Canada and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Neto is urged to continue war against drug carts in Mexico, although he had no more detailed.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with amertume.
Most of the Americans, probably, have never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States have disappeared Mexico and forced his leaders to write the half of their territory to the fusil point.
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, remembers are everywhere.
Therefore, since a U.S. official forms the critical currency in the Mexican, you start to hear - in the Mexico press, and among the electors -- claims on the way the Americans get to the sovereignty of their neighborhood.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the bagar.
Yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country involves more than 35 million Mexico-Americans who live in the United States.
Would you like we're taking the subject of the armory?
There are many.
Mexican has its guests and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the great number of Mexico ancients in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at a moment given, in our genealogic tree, a person, maybe a father or a grandparent, has found no opportunity to meet the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a type of profile -- a fountained, not teaching, issue of a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexican.
And even if we live now the American dream, which we have gone into good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose the view that this is the American dream that we live, and not the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is clear.
We agree it to the United States.
Furthermore, we know that a part of the Mexican election between the leader class doesn't love us.
The feeling is reciproc.
We remind them of a humiliating disface, and they touch us as if we were low and not enough mexican individuals.
Our Spanish will never be enough, our links with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is a failure synonym.
If our families hadn't missed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have gone.
And we wouldn't find us cointed from the right side of the barrier, which live consistently in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who was legally migrated in the United States when she was a child, remembers that there is frequency between Mexico and Mexico and Mexico, because the Mexicans gain more firmly their identity and the Mexico-Americans.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels to be part of two countries.
Furthermore, many Mexico-Americans who I know do not have the impression to be part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del North, but also the Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of the two worlds, but we're not broken in no one of the two.
In Mexico, we are as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered as Mexicans.
And now, to comply with the relationship, as I learned it during my home, some Mexico leaders and a part of the intelligence want to be close to Diaspora.
They want that the Mexico-American work as strong embatters for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should explain to our American compatriories that Mexico is a great country that needs absolutely to visit and press the political leaders to strengthen connections with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much amertume.
And, if we consider inequalities of salary, corruption and violence related to drugs that are universal, many of us are not surprised that it is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to break you alone, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States in the way they have treated Mexican a century ago, they should therefore accept that some Mexico-American will always want them as long as their family members have been treated.
Hmm.
Maybe we are more "Mexicans" that I didn't think.
Beloved Vieles, New Middle East
The fire between Israel and Hammas is still a failure for peace.
Can it never have a sustainable peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood exposure seems to indicate that such hope is free.
While the same football arguments pertain to know who has started, decades of buildings have been reduced in poussière; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were citizens, and six Israelites were killed; and for the first time Gaza's robbery rockets were rented near to Tel-Aviv, the metropolit of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But though the Israelites and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their old conflict, around them, the Middle East is full mutation.
The Arab printemps did all fly in slides, and the Palestinians and the Israelites are cut off by this regional boulversy.
Perhaps their fight will be a little more intensive.
However, there are all reasons for thinking that this could help them out of this dead impasse.
A war that doesn't make any loser or winner
First, it seems to be difficult to prove optimism.
Even if the fire held on 21 November remains, the fights of this week have strengthened the party of the force, both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that leads Gaza since 2007, will need to have forced the Israelites to leave, even if Gaza had suffered a crack.
Having killed some of his leaders and refused the 1,7 million in Gaza in one of the most merciful and overwhelmed sides of the planet, Israel did not succeed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas wins the land on the Cisjordania, the other part of Palestinian currently in the hands of their rivages of Fatah, the other Palestinian more moderate.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas could say that the time is with them.
The influence of the Arabic Islamists is stronger, and Hamas became rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power in full exsorption, at least the Moslem Alliance of the nearest Israel, took and caused Hamas; as well as Qatar, one of the most rich and dynamic states of the Golf.
The members of the Hammas jubilate and say that the crowd Islamist runs around Israel from the north Libanon, where the Military of Hezbollah exercises his domination through Syria, where the rebels of Islamic trends can turn to Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas' alliances menather the king.
And the most important, on the southern side of Israel, the Mount of Muslim Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, from the farmer and the central of the Arab countries, has changed the equation of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this deposit that governed Egypt for 30 years until his hit in 2011, was a little time to celebrate Hamas.
However, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas' councils, and their leaders are easier to the public opinion.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas may suffer as an important actor that will not even be excluded by Israel and America.
During this time, the party of the hard line of Israel will take the inverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was released in the box.
The intercept system of baptized missiles Iron Dome proved its efficiency and many Hammas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears - for a certain time.
In diplomacy terms, America renews its independent support, and many European countries have invited Hamas to be in the origin of the last violence vague.
However, in particular, Israel prospered, in particular under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza's rockets were killed at about 30 Israelites since 2004, Israel was separated by their own attention, especially by the separation barry on the Cysjordania, the main piece of what could be Palestinian state, and that protects the Jews colonies who continue to exceed their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Party Likud assembled with a more beautiful party, is the best part of the leader Abigdor Lieberman at the approach of the election of 22 January.
Why do these Palestinian fishs fall by giving them a state?
If they were leaving the Cisjordania, wouldn't they launch rockets, as their compatriots did it in Gaza?
It's preferable to keep them behind this wall and shoot them while they're out of the head.
Perhaps the party of the line will bring it hard; but it may change the Arab printemps.
Even if the Islamists who take the power in Egypt and others appreciate not to Israel, their priority will be attached to problems in their own country.
The budget of Israel's defence is more important than one of his four neighborhoods of Arabic meetings.
Starting a war with local superpublishment will not help the new Arab governments to organize their economys.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a stop of the fire that is good to increase -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think of the future.
With the rest of the Arab world that becomes more democratic, the price of Palestinians of their right to autodetermination could create a puzzle that is wanted to explore a day in the occupied territories of Israel - a little as the bus explored in Tel-Aviv this week.
The repression has already demonstrated the democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exceeds this problem so that the Arab population increases.
The blood missions against Gaza every two or three years to dream Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic plan.
Both sides need to be cut off by the outside.
The answer remains the proposed by reasonable persons that are found on each side, and most of the external world and this journal: two states, with a delay of territorie by Israel in the scroll of security.
A small and short term is that the stop of fire will give the opportunity for external persons to defend this cause.
The Egyptian, who now needs to end up to the movement of weapons to Gaza, at the same time as Turkey and Qatar, is best placed than ever to persecute Hamas to accept a Jewish state in accordance with the borders of 1967 with landscape and a party Jerusalem.
The Arabs of the outer countries should also press Hamas and Fatah to join themselves.
This would contribute to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal of a Pseudo State to the United Nations.
Mr Obama also interested in what Israel accepted to negotiate.
During his first mandate, he didn't present his own peace plan.
Returning to the Blanche House, he seems to be able to establish one.
It's a very excited vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital injury for America.
This happens by a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarettes are in force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs recover the dark green packages that are all identical, such as the mark
This law entered into force in Australia is the first world, logs and colors were replaced by a dark and horrible oil photos of sick organs and children's representations, which diseases were caused by the taagisme of their parents.
Outside the various photos and health warnings, the only differences between packages, since this Sabbath, is the name of the mark, printed in small characters on all packages.
It is the most strict system in the world on tabac emballing.
The Australian Federal Government stated that the objective was to disappear young people to fuel by eliminating all glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started fuel before 26 years ago, there is 99% of chances that they never start.
"Every when they are very young, the children understand the message carried out by tabac manufacturers through their mark image," said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, in citing studies that showed for example that children associated the core of a logo to a princess."
Even if Australia records the less tobacco rate in the world and if these changes have only a little impact on multinational benefits, other countries have an analog delay.
The tobacco industry made pressure against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers stated that this would reach the trade of the black market, which would make easier access to lower cigarettes.
"For negative consequences they will decline from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia.
China and Indonesia's fausers will well sell more cygarettes in Australia's streets.
Others said that this law had dynamised their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, declared that the request of cigarettes, in particular in silicone to hide the horrible balances, has increased several months ago since the British American Tobacco, the British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco, have been cut off the law and lost before the high court of Australia.
He stated that Zico sold it to the bigs, and he was looking for a renewable stock.
For us, the cases are good.
The only age, the experts, says, is the popularity of social media and the rate of population referred to by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting publicities in the TV, sportive sponsoring and the obligation for revengers to disease cigarettes, the tabak marketing is now available online.
Australia has prohibited publicity on the Web by companies and local sites, but it cannot stop strangers to do it.
"If you work in the marketing of the tabac and you have no more than a small vitrine to promote your products, the Internet is the uncontornable place by exciting," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher in Sydney University.
Freeman noted a increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens for social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We need to ask if it's a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has been punished to make a video, or if it's a marketing campaign organized by an agence?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force instead of marketing.
The industry has gone to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to meet these new justice decisions - these countries have stated the WTO that trade is unjustly disappeared, although none of these countries had a significant trade change with Australia.
A decision of the WTO should be taken in the current year of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the Government had discussed with other countries on analogy laws on emballages.
Canadian was the first country to provide warning photos on the emergency in 2001.
Now these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Most serious laws are currently in English, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many fumers in Australia remain insensible to these photos.
The photos don't have me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and you range the package," said Victor El Hage when you buy a package on which you figure a painting photo of the mouth.
To be frank, the only reason he's going to stop me is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in Sydney's centre, stated that the uniform of the emballs would make difficult the range of packages on the stages.
"Before, I needed an hour to load a cold, now I need four hours," said Yu.
"The government had only to interfere them a good time for all, and we would say OK, it's good, we'd stop and put the key under the door," he added, when the arms up to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to be disappointed.
I had five hours in a airport during the period of Thanksgiving, because our airport had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another airport.
So, I had enough time to think about the threat of the threat.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Pass a half-day day in a airport to wait for a fly is enough increasing, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distrate you (not forget the duty-free boots).
Moreover, some universities and experts specialized in the development of the child are the enthusiasm.
It's perfectly normal for us - and our children - to hate time in time, they say.
This forces the brain to build interesting paths, to eat creativity.
And as we are, for most, constantly before several types of screens, we don't know the benefits of the age.
So we should buy the enemy in open arms?
Yeah.
And not.
But I'll be back.
First, in the case of many people, I thought that the ennui was a phenomenon most recently, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek-Romean history in Calgary University, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The remote dream," he said.
On the walls of Pompei, the Latin Graphites that call the ennui, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to the age.
The problem is that he has been defined, and discussed, in various ways, John D. Eastwood, a joint psychology teacher in the York University in Ontario, Canada.
Following many publications and submitting the idea to a group of discussions about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the other as a experience that is "to do something but without coming to start in a satisfactory activities."
The differences of the chapter, he says, is that the person is not able to train a job that she would like.
With the party, he said, there's no way to do something.
What is in the heart of the enthusiasm, he said is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a violent humor and the feeling that the time passes lately."
The nut can look strongly like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood stated that if both can be linked, people who hate think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes it happens to think we're happy when it's actually a concentration problem.
In the framework of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the Journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have shown an older experience in which the participants listed on the case, the voice of a person to read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard, at the room side, his too high TV emission that had no report, others just heard the TV emission, and the third group has not heard the band of sound.
Those who have heard the TV at a low sound level said that they were more nervous than the two other groups -- they had bad to concentrate themselves, but they didn't know why, and they assigned this concentration problem to the surface.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or take-up task, an interruption of attention can lead to the age, Mark J. Fenske, a pleasant teacher of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study authors.
Instead, when you do a renewable task, "come looking at objects on a mount chain, music can help you not treat you."
In fact, he says, now we know that when we are punished or attacked, these gestures, often considered as signs of ennui, are actually a good way to remain physically more careful.
"The studies have shown that children who are allowed to learn gigoter are more and have more information than those who are forced to stay without move," said Professor Fenske.
We are all hunting one day or another - the late of my air fly, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly nervous film.
But some persons are more susceptible of tolerance than others.
In order to measure this, researchers have developed a "predictional scale" in the 80s.
The scale includes comments such as, "For the tasks I do, many of them are repeative and monotons," and "I have so much interest centers that I don't have the time to do."
By using such a scale, the researchers discovered that the boys have tendency to deny more than the girls, he told Stephen Vodanovich, a psychologist teacher in the University of West Florida, and especially needs many and varied stimulations.
But in general, the boys are quickly crazy.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a individual and community development teacher in the University of Illinois, made an experience in which he contacted about 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times per day.
He raised that 32% of the boyfriends would declare to be in the school and during their debts in the house, while 23 percent would declare to be denied when they were not at school.
In addition, 3 per cent of the parents stated to be disappointed.
Professor Larson stated that he didn't know if the percentage of today, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescent is a period when the age gets its higher level," especially because children and adolescents do not have a lot of control on what they want to do.
If I rest my question, is it good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can lead to people to take absurd physical risks, to make pairs or to use some substances to pass time, as studies show it.
However, many philosophy and writers call a link between the ennui and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studys the problem since over two decades.
"The ennui is the way the brain has found to make you know you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychologist professor in the U.S.
But the brain doesn't always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you hate and use this energy to play the guitar and cuisine, it will make you happy.
But if you look at the TV, it will make you happy at short term, but not long term.
So if your child's happy and gives him a iPad, he will not be disgusted, but he will not learn to do anything alone or to apply, says Professor Fenske.
"It's authorised to be a situation to another," said he.
Your child is not only learning to be amused, but he has more managers of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the wound.
As I don't think we should criticize it.
It feels outside the consistency that generates activities and technologies is the objective to which we should take place.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to deny more often, but the neighbor has an aggressive and frenetic desire to be connected to something that has sense," he said.
According to him, what people look for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the stop time.
"In a environment where we are constantly hyperstimuled," he added, "it's difficult to find ways to start in something when the sound stops."
In Colorado, no Directive for the new Marijuana legislation
Anthony Orosco, 19 years old, studying in a university and foot player in Colorado, is inculcated for something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana bottles and a pipe used to fuel them.
Mr. Orosco stated that one day, in September, he and some friends were on the border of a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozoco received a citation to compare for drugs and materials that can use for its consumption - small delays, each one with an amendment of $100 - and a compared date.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty, which followed the vote of Colorado to legalize the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for its personal use, the response brought to hundreds of employees that implied a failure drug use depending on more than the law.
Here and in Washington's state, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of delays involved the use of marijuana have been classified immediately.
Police services have stopped involving adults of 21 years and more for the minority of marijuana, because the law will enter into force in the future weeks.
But the procureurs who are in the most conservative circumscriptions of Colorado called to accelerate existing marijuana businesses and continue to include people who have it.
Parallelly, several cities from Denver's banks to the West mountains vote currently to prevent the opening of marijuana markets approved by the State in their apartments.
"The things develop so quickly that I don't know what we reserve the future," said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of the police of Aurora, on the east of Denver.
Washington State regulation organisations are also not a bad question.
They are looking for Directives on the way to install a permission system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the date of bottom from 1 December 2013.
They say that the Colorado, who wants or not, is on the most of the regulations on marijuana, first on the use of therapeutic purposes and now on personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and constitutes a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, port-word of Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith recognizes, can make more than suggesting what is working.
"There's no reality before we could be based on," he said.
The Washington law, which is named I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which leaves a legal empty year, during which the permission system will not always exist, while the marijuana possession will be legal.
During this time, practical issues remain in suspension: how to equalize the state mandate that guarantees appropriate access to the marijuana approved and prohibited the installation of cannabis trade in a 30 km around a school, park, a game land or a crash.
"There's no more difficult places than the cities of the areas to install a comprehensive trade of cannabis, in particular in Seattle's metropolitin area," said Ben Livingston, a port of the Canadian Legalization Centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the head of the police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announced that the "City attorney" (presentative of the public ministry) would no longer continue the 21 years and more persons who had small quantities of marijuana, and that the police had to disappear the persons for this type of slide "immediately".
The Boss Oates stated that the police would apply new justice decisions that regulate the activities of those who serve marijuana to medical purposes and that he would continue to continue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in the north of Colorado, the "district attorney" (Republic Procureur), Ken Buck incarneously.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to take care of marijuana business, mainly to press on users to desintoxic.
In the present time, 119 persons are included with 56 grams or less marijuana, but many of them are the object of other inculptions.
"Our office has the obligation to ensure continues against those who have committed a decree that, during facts, was a recognised infraction," said Mr Buck.
Reactions were even complicated in rural places such as Messa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the Communities, has no longer compared adults for restrictive quantities.
The representative of the Public Ministry of the Communities, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to class all marijuana detention affairs.
"I have no pressure to lose my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the voters of Colorado had supported the measure, offering a legal and governmental framework appropried to marijuana personal consumption is nothing easy.
And the contradictive reactions observed in various American cities show the deep ambivalence among local officials in respect of the legalization of marijuana.
"It is a cultural barry" with representatives of the public ministry, stated Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver, who represents the persons accused of consumption of marijuana and expressed as local port-word of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws).
"They have passed a good part of their life to continue in justice of people who consume marijuana, and they also have evil to accept that it is legal."
As the first states to treat the restricted consumption of marijuana at the same level as the alcohol, Colorado and Washington states are able to become a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs.
While defenders and representatives of the State provide a new frontier of legitimate ventures, they are concerned with concern the directives of the federal government, which always consists of sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of marijuana legalization hoped that the Ministry of the Justice would cedar.
Although some mediterraneous arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and soldiers, the federal government has been allowed to trade marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police would probably not steal the doors to enter small drugs, it is strong to be able to adjust to marijuana purchased trades in customers authorized by new laws, Kevin A. Sabet, an old politician adviser of Obama.
Many cities in Colorado have not expected that the federal authorities act.
Even before the votes, some local administrations have approved moratoires on the creation of new marijuana trades, even if it is only a report of a year.
The last week, the city of Montrose has received a moratory of 6 months, and it should be imposed to the next week.
"We don't want to find us in a situation where a permission is given to someone and then find us compared to a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the Community instead of the vote of the State.
There are many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was deceived and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
They are not only students of today who are attacked for their opinions.
So far as I remember, I've always dreamed to enter Oxford University.
My father and my elder brother studied in what it was for me a great place to know, a kind of Greek amphite of modern times that stimulates both civilization pilars, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed in Worcester College at the end of the 80s to study the story, I decided to make my validity, making the first scanning of my life.
My father fell down and began to cry.
My friends were detonated.
The Evening Standard Journal suggested that I had left this university, because I had objected the fact that students of the first cycle had sexual relations in the room near my room.
The author A.N. Wilson declared with fate that I was party after I was forced to drink in broken tissues.
The truth was less drunk.
I left.
Yeah, I was gone, because I was victim of intimidations and made the object of burning constants.
Not because of my name, but not because of my name, nor because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I have been persecuted for a single and unique reason, and in this seat of the self-declaring, I have been victims of a racist and barbar: my regreted father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influenced advice of Margaret Thatcher and I was party of the Conservatory Party.
Why to call this today, you'll tell me.
However, recent studies have discovered that a new generation of students of centre-right is the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalised hatred of the students of Tory in Oxford is as last week, some of them have required a protection of their rights, as well as the gays, honoured persons and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the room of the students (JCR) of the Corps Christi College stated that they were "somely isolated, personally attacked and feeling indesiderable" because of their political opinions.
They want to have a representative within the University Committee for the equality of opportunities to be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary distributed on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The country of wonderful: Young, Intelligents and Droite"), consisting to the policy of students, and to describe the "Tories" as excentrical and neonazis.
In particular, the Student Joe Cooke, ancient president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) ", which moves to Rolls-Royce, trees a full silver tree and moves with a chromeous canne.
In other universities, the conservative students say to be treated as emissary bows in place to increase school prices."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", said to a diary journal of the Sunday, "this there is a rounding part of a growing left part in universities.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, student in history in the Corps of Christ, who proposed a move for more protection, said that such climate is "incomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, President of the OUCA, said that there was a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR in respect of the persons that are centre-right.
"This is an introduction to the freedom of intellectual discussions, as well as members," she said.
I was the only thing to think about my first weeks in Oxford.
I came in September 1986, then I was 18 years old and a paralysante timing.
The hate of the conservator party was very virus.
In the past year, the university voted the refuse to agree to Margaret Thatcher - an old student - a honourable title, due to the reduction of the funding of higher studies.
The atmosphere was carried out of stalinian vibrations.
Since the first day of the week of adventure, when the new students have made knowledge with the others and teachers, I had a pre-government of what was going to happen afterward.
I discovered that the teachers did not only participate in the scarcasms to the students of Tory, but also, they had a pleasure.
It was likely that the policy on gravity minors, privacy and opposition of government's sanctions against the apartheid in South Africa was gravited in the woods of class sales.
The first sarcasm I was victimed was a translation to the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared.
"Mrs Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt, "see Translation the first paragraph"
I lost the feet.
Pitt, a little man in a puzzle face, was easy to take.
"Is that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students got ridiculous.
The lambs burned my eyes.
"I suggest you to take French courses during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy to make you friends," he started from one of your army.
I'm back into my room, unconsolidable.
I was sitting alone in the evening that night, and I felt a lot of tickets on my bed.
It was a second student in the second year of English studies, named James, who was presented as a member of the UCA.
"I know who you are," he said, very well.
I'm afraid it's like that.
Everybody understood to be a Tory (conservant) is taken for target.
It's too hard for me, but they know your father's near Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be more hard for you.
Most of the young Tory suggests to be the Labour (employees).
Later, at the local pub, I tried to hide me.
I insisted on the fact that I wasn't agreed with all that Mrs. Thatcher said.
This strategy failed.
One student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, in an ironically, studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pork."
You're wounded.
Other students have recovered the refrigerator.
I was perverted, sale.
"How are the Tories doing love?" asked one of them.
They're fighting each other, isn't they?
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixty years.
Could I just get a normal life to Oxford?
Have I been forced to meet people who share the same points of view only after night falling?
Have I had to be Labour and renew my opinions?
The three years in the future were like a purgator of ostrosism and isolation.
The only open teacher of Tory was Norman Stone, a modern story teacher, teaching in my university.
He was not only hate because he was a conservator, but also because he was advising in the outside policy of Thatcher and one of the authors of his talks.
He wasn't almost there.
He hateed this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his adhesion at the markist-determinist view of the history.
In 1997, he accepted a teacher position to the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started to make the ship between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding a refuge to my family and my most openest friends of spirit.
I told my father I hate Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredible.
In his studies in Oxford, in 40 years, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city to dreams.
Even my communist friends had unreproved ways.
He had the weeping in his eyes.
Let them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tackle you.
That would break my heart if you left Oxford.
My emotional resistance was progressively deteriorated by my frequencies to London.
A friend, too, Tory, struck the pressure and rejected his convictions.
During a meeting of work led the next week, when another story teacher suggested the most seriously of the world, that I was "the enemy of the people," I decided to do so.
In the midst of famine, I admitted to be victim of the brain lavage of my parents, and I treated them with "excellent fous".
The break was a short time.
It's my father who's the last cloud of my oxford circle.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes my followers left.
When they went, I made my validity and I took the first train for London.
I've never been back.
You can treat me with a plornichard smoke.
But no 18-year-old child should be victim of such an intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which produced not only 14 Prime Ministers of Tory, but also benefits of an inevitable reputation of equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentino prefers the elegancy to the notoriety "
In the framework of the "Valentino: a Master of the Court ", inaugurated this week in London, ABC asked Naty Abascal, Fiona Thysen-Bornamisza and other Italian customers.
Somerset House, ancient residence of Elizabeth Ire of England is the only place of the British capital is worth to accuse an exposition on Valentino Garavani.
The customer recognized it when "Valentino: a Master of the Court", a prestigious review that gathers more than 130 high cowture models for his cowing house during the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the orgue point of a story whose only protagonist is "Mr. Garavani", but he could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and from the nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened to the next 3 March, there is an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cross of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passed by the Princess Mary-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino expresses its personal memories as the tropees of his social assessment: the modest customer of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jetset.
There's nothing bad to love the kingdom.
"Always, they don't exceed their cigarettes on your beautiful tapes as it makes some stars of the pop music," says Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alpes and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives generousness and elegance.
"We all worshiped to be invited in his chalet of Gstaad," explains the ex-shirt woman of "Heini" Thyssen, an immediate friend of beauty of the past time like Marella Agnelli or Eugeneia Niarchos.
Valentino has always prefered the elegancy to the notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, bringing a Valentino model
The argentin mannequin, Valeria Mazza, hasn't forgotten the charm of the courtier.
A few years ago, after a defiled place of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were a twenty-five people, between Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"Before he, each invitation felt important and appreciated," remembers the "top model ", which started working with him during the week of the High-Court in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass in mode, because his creations are art works," she finished.
Nobless line defiled
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves the highest people and with the largest tits and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a podium glamour of sixty-six-six-six-six-seconds wide glamour, which proposes to switch the roles: the visitor takes the place of mannequins and must defile on the podium to admire a "public" dream with the main creations of Valentino, as the size that Jackie Kennedy chose for his marriage with Aristote Onessis, the costum that led Monica Vitti into the "La Notte" or a dream in the lake and looking at the Farah Diba.
In this public of mannequins, we find names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria van Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norvege, Rosario de Bulgary or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and Court in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "unable to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pantalon, a chemise, a "gillette" gilet and a garment of the automne-hiver collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift that he did to me," said Naty Abascal, one of the museums of the courtier.
"I prefer to all the others for his female love, his great love of women, and because he exalted our beauty," adds Feria's ex-duxy.
I love the colors he uses, they are light and light the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and modestic Patricia of the Joovampaola of Arenberg cannot, she can't forget the first time she brought a Valentino model.
When she was a boyfriend and lived in Italy, she dreamed to have the age and the opportunity to take one of her night clothes...
Finally, it was possible at the end of the 90s.
I buyed my first Valentino model for a feast in the chamber of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening clothing, with a flying egg, a dragged bus, and a decolled to fall.
"It was a dream of reality," said Rodrigue's widow of Arenberg.
"Valentino is infected in the mode, he is obtained by the immediate", explains the Italian aristocrate who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the courtier's evening clothing with "the biggest sight, because a night clothing is not only a clothing, it is also the whole memory that she carrys."
The "roi" of the mode
The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is the marriage clothing of Marie-Chantal Miller during his marriage with Paul de Greece in 1995.
He was missing four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couthorist calls as well as its couthors) to complete this clothing in seat with perles increasing, twelve sorts of different dentals and a train of four meters and half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized pressure, this robe represents a history of the high court of the end of the XXe.
Obublished for years by the "snow-self" of the Nobless, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Grand Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated from the Honneur Legion, Garavani is so honorable than any wife of his clients.
"It's a refrigerant, his calm, his smoke and perfect look has always saved me before the eyes," recognized Arenberg.
Last time I saw it, it was a month ago at a gala dinner in Orsay Museum.
He was sitting on the table of the Jacqueline Comts of Ribes, one of my big friends.
"He was emphasisable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The most severe measure of the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, indonesian volcan portors risk their life and health by bringing 70 kilos of suffering through the roads of scattered stone.
There are people for whom the work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Antowijaya, one of the 400 minors who win their lives by bringing the suffering of the Kawah Ijen Volcan, East of the Indian Island of Java.
He needs to work every day until the base of the crater, where the sulfury gas extincts of the ground are solidized in the air contact.
After collecting large rocks of sugar, which are totally about 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo patterns that he loads on his bottles through the scarped paths.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcan that smoke to 2.386 meters of height, but the ports remote ports have more than 40 minutes to grab this distance, to a torture room, keeping the balance and measured their steps to not tremb and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false stage could cost them life, as it happened to a French tourist who made a mortal challenge in the Kawah Ijen volcan for many years ago .
Kawah Ijen's kids won 5 cents of euro for each kids of suffering.
Once up, it was a road between tourists who photographed them as if they were circle animals, and penally carrying the painters, they walk 3 km until the balance that a miner society has installed a little contrabate to 1,850 meters of height.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company who explores the volcan since 1960 and can say that its employees, which pays 662 indonesian roupes (5 cents of euro) by kilos of suffering.
She then sold it to 10,000 ropes (83 cents of euro) to the petrochimical industry because this mineral is very present in the day life and is used to manufacture bogs, artificial fires, cosmetics, dinamite and serves even to white the sugar.
"How we transport about about 70 kilos, we gather about 46,000 roupes (3,8 euros) to each travel," explains Anto, which generally works three journeys.
Everyone takes 3 hours and finishs, but this allows him to win 138,000 roupes (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a mixer for such surhuman efforts, it is the triple of what he would win in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid 15,000 ropes (1,20 euros) per day and where the average payment is two million ropes (167 euros)," states the portor who worked forward as a mass on the tourist island of Bali.
At the same time, his salary was 75,000 roupes (6,20 euros) per day and the job was not so hard, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcan, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is also indiscutable that the suffering: "I married a young daughter of Bali, where they are hinduists, and I brought her to Java to return to Islam."
Anto suffering of asthme, respirating with difficulty, all constantly and his eyes are threatened by toxic gass.
In 27 years, he passed three of his life to delay the danger on Kawah leaving, but the suffering has already started to pay the facture well that he covers his face with a mask and brings special gens.
Anto suffering of asthme, respirating with difficulty, all constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gass rejected by the volcan.
It's the price he needs to pay to continue his dream.
"I'm going to work two years more, because I want to open a boot or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Malemed by life, this young sympathy and intelligent may be tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead of that, he's doing the work of a mule.
It shares a massage of unsaluble tree with other porters, it rises up every day to two hours of the morning because the summer does not stop swallowing the night, when its yellow color becomes blue and brilliant in the middle of darkness.
In disappointing the darkness, Anto descended into the cratery with a small lamp fixed in his box, that he was buying himself with his own money.
Some 400 porters load suffering painters on their balls from the ground of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the Mineral company has not mekanished the extraction of the suffering to economy costs and provides no equipment to the porters who work at their account and are paid to the rate.
Furthermore, they do not touch any of the 30,000 roupes (2,50 euros) of more than 15,000 roupes (1,20 euros), which the customers of this natural park made to tourists who came to photograph the volcan and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," Protector Madrusin, a corrupt portor of 42 years who works in Kawah Ijen since he left the college.
It's able to bring up to 110 kilos, he's sure he's not gonna stop working "which he can" because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, age between 10 and 18 years.
I'm not gonna take my retreat, I'll die here because the volcan is my whole life.
Although the suffering suffers the gorge and disturbs the eyes when the wind turns and puts the smaller in the fields of fume columns that come from the volcan, they are so suffering that nobody will suffer severe diseases... to which of course their normal respiratory problems, arthroses, painters in the yellows and skins, deformed by the painers' paints.
By equilibration of the panier on its two, Oneinik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions and his companions extracted 15 tons of suffering from the volcan, that three cams carried out to the port of Tamansari, to 18 kilometres from there through a path of chews invaded by the bad herbs.
"I'll not take my retrait, I'll die here because the volcan is all my life," says Oneinik by opening the mouth well, devoting several missing dents.
The age of his five children, 30 years old, works also as a suffering portor.
The time passes, but the perpetual mixture of generation in generation one of the most difficult methods in the world: who makes the human mules in the Kawah volcan.
Singapur search for children to save economy
Singapurs take responsibility for this absence of children on the carrier, the street and the cost of access to the property.
"The population of Singapore must develop."
I'm a husband and a patriote, you're my wife and a patriote, let's fulfill our debt town and give life!
It can appear increasingly that these words come from a publicity for patterns at menthe, but although this, or maybe thanks to it, the video has been broken as a training training on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a group of rap that uses local references as "Let's put a police in the shooter" to meet Singapur's birthrate.
BBH, the publicity agency at the original of the video, hopes to attract the attention of the problem in a amusing way through this publicity.
His Creative Director, Douglas Hamilton, stated that he wanted to use the power of music to fill people "their national debt".
It is only destined to the Internet, so we could make it fun and amusant.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the nature, so we felt that it was a subject that we should approach.
We knew that the government had tried many things as to launch perfumes to heroin or organize speed-dating nights.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not work strongly.
So we said the following thing: What is more creative to resolve this problem than to make a song of rap?
1,2 Children
The Government of Singapore does not take it so small.
He spends $1,300 per year in political policy to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A measure of the Government for marriage and fathers gives up to 15,000 dollars per child, long-term maternity conges and distribute fishing benefits.
But all this had a little effect.
Singapur is a rich and high technology of South-East Asia, also known for the conservation of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapur's birthrate, in accordance with its national population distribution, is currently located at 1,2 children by women.
The last time he was found above 2, considered as the renewing rate, it was in 1976.
So why do the Singapurs have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage policies and family of the National Division of the Population, states that it has to be a "better education" and "a larger choice of carrier opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a larger gamma of options in terms of life and priorities, beside the marriage and the constitution of a family," explains.
These changes of social standards have contributed to increase the number of cellulars and to retard marriage and birth, which has resulted in a reduction of birthrate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy to rarely increase the immigration to resist the reduction of the population has created a resistance within the local population.
In Singapur, there are web sites that include a xenophobia in pain in the meeting of new immigrants, especially for Chinese who are accused to get the salaries to the bottom and not to be involved.
The increase of immigration is also considered as one of the reasons for which the party in Singapore has known its worst electoral results since the independent year.
Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the implementation of costs and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the consumption of birthrate has known effects on the economic growth of a country, fishing income, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
The Government tries to escape the construction of many small houses.
For example, this began to touch the immobilier sector.
The citizen development authorities began to control the number of small apartments, known under the name of the "cause box", which could be built in determined areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned with the fact that they could promote a lifestyle of celibatary and encourage promotors who want to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of Immobiliar Society EL Developers, tell me that his "cause boxes" sells much faster than the largest apartments.
They are more popular, in the meaning that these apartments are very faster than those of the largest size.
For this reason, it's much more worthy for our treasury.
However, he admits that new standards give more clear instructions to promotors, which were first put by bathrooms in the roads if they wanted to offer too small apartments in a project.
Too stress
Singapur is a city.
If these new regulations could be a step to increase national birthrate, discussing with the Singapurians who work in the financial quarter of the center, it would seem that they would not have much effects.
"The people are very stretched, houses are hot, even as education, it's why people get it later," says a young framework.
Others can have children.
"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," says we another young one of 20 years.
Mans and women mention their carrier, stress and cost of access to the property and education as the reasons that refuse them to have children.
Thus, although the Government tries to convince his citizens to have children, when it is to make children, they are the Singapurians themselves who have the last word.
What is private outline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is the quality of the private area or "the area of private life we can protect from any intrusion."
What does this take from the private area for less than 16 years?
How to apply this definition in the daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers in which he is expressed by discovering events that he would certainly not share outline?
The Journal of the Periodic asked five young boys, age between 10 and 15 years, frequency users of the steel.
In four cases, they associated the term "what is something very personal" on the personal plan and "Password and username" when they apply it to social networks.
"I will not deny my personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years, when he trys to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messager, where he has a account for two years.
"It's very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," says he.
On FB, I'm putting sympa images or games.
I'm talking to my friends too.
"I will not share one of my photos or someone who would do the imbécile," he said.
The young boy recognized that it was bad to publish obscene photos, denied persons, crimes, or writes of humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine subscriptions on Twitter.
Most are of the family.
His mother actually knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting twitters.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just posting them," added he.
"The social networks are happy, I can talk to a lot of parents or with my friends, quickly," he said.
He states that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He won't trust anybody who would recommend him a stranger.
Joseph's case, 14 years, is different.
The adolescent has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, at the last, he admits not to know 20 of his friends' list.
"It's not worried because we have something common, for example the music," says he.
According to the young boy, no one has made him progress or requested his address or his phone number.
"If they had the pressure or required it, I would just remove them from my account," he recognizes.
Joseph was subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
Experiences that are known today under the name of cyberharcence are not foreign to a young boy.
A nearby one of my friends was racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and required money.
"He never knew who it was."
The victim, according to Joseph, didn't close his account.
"He just passed it in private profile."
Then he explains a series of manipulations to configure its account safe.
In Jorge's difference, this young man would put photographs of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassable situations.
Yeah, I would do it if I was hungry or energy.
"Even if I know it's cyberharkment," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English and licensed in education and learning, considers that, in order to orientate children and children, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to be informed.
"The Internet surrounded as a way to search for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the game rule has changed," she mentioned.
It signs that the académician Marc Prensky, who has a pedagogian master of Yale University and the author of the book "Natives and Numeric Immigrates", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Numeric births are they, children and young people who are born with the technologies.
"We, we are the digital immigrants that we need to teach them here, while we are trying to learn," she said.
It adds that the theme is complex, "and we ask them to have a criteria defined on what it should or not be divulgating, publishing or telling a age where they don't have the maturity necessary to do it."
"We also ask them to be elective when the most important is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences" adds it.
According to the specialist, the most efficient way to learn confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"They say not to do anything to do," she said.
Then, Porras says some examples: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, do you like them to publish a photo of you like the friend you've published?
Do you know what the others publish on you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask others the permission to identify them?
And also, everybody needs to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do it outline.
These are the same rules.
"In the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be similar on social networks," she says.
Surveillance
Stuardo Guardia, teacher of university, primary Institute and education adviser, states that it is essential that parents read consciously the conditions of use of social networks.
In the understanding of each of the terms, they will have solid bases to discuss with their children the implications of a account on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what is allowed to share or publish," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind the children that he doesn't need to talk to strangers.
The summary of the Unasur has been completed without the declaration of Lima is published
The Vie presidential of the Union of South America (Unasur) has been completed today in Peru without the public statement of Lima, although it was announced previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 present mandaters.
Efe has tried to access the document signed by the Ordinary meeting of State and Government of the United States, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency have reported that it would be developed after the conclusion of the summit, and then stated that it would be published on the other side of the Peruvan government.
When they were asked about the text, they reported that its content was exposed by the President of Peru, Olant Humala, in short statements to pressure.
The access of journalists to the information on the summary was constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private, restricted audio session" was distributed in the press room.
The little information between the journalists were data by the press press attachments of some of the UNasur governments who assisted to you except the Peruvan Portuguese.
The only document declared during the day was the list of present Presidents, which has provoked a certain disease in hundreds of journalists of various national and international media, which recall more important information.
Afterward, the President of Peru sent an electronic mail to media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the talk of the President Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summary.
In October last, Peru was the host of the 3th Summe of South-America (ASPA) and, at this time, although it was requested by the press, it was not distracted any more the statement called Lima Declaration, as it was announced before.
On the ASPA official site, we can check that the document was published last March.
In the two international offices, the Peruvanian authorities have tried to place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the maximum obtainment of information.
The summary was also concluded with the Joint Agreement of Chili and Peru to accept the Court of La Haye, which covers a different border between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chili, Sebastian Pinera, were gathered together during the regional meeting and told them that they would respect the decision of the CIJ to hear the joints of the two parties in the process that Lima tried against Santiago and who began lunch to La Haye.
"We respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the differences we bring today to this international court," said President Humala, near his chilian homolog.
"The Chili has always been, and it will continue to be a respectful country of international law, peaceful resolution of controversy, treaties and international courts," added the President Pinnerra by giving a hand-up to the President Humala, near the drapeal of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two Presidents that they were submitted to the CIJ has been found after the Colombia denied the Bogota Pacte by which she had accepted to submit the decisions of this International Court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that she considered seriously wrong.
The summa was without the presence of Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
The Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after his ex-President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in your convention.
The president of the Hospital, Ollanta Humala, was loaded to open the deliverations on the morning and closing the summit little after midnight in Lima.
The mandator had read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements were adopted and that 31 project lines were fixed between South Americas for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
In the agreements adopted, he noted that the countries of the Unasur would place "important demarks to achieve the purpose of the South America citizenship by the development of agreements on residential permissions".
He informed that actions would be enhanced to improve cooperation against urban insurance and the international organizated crime, actions for better accessibility to medicines, low prices Internet in South America, and to assess the risks of natural catastrophes together and effectively.
With a crisis Europe, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triomphatic matrix but needs to help increase our productive matrix and bring a better future for our people," concluded President Humala.
"We decided to make a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of spaces in South America, in particular in the rural and border areas... in unioning our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvan President.
In these projects, he noted that five were concerned with the Peru and were on the transversary across its territory, from the cost to Brazil, and that two had considered a more important connection with the Equator, although he had not given more details.
The final document also refers to the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration within the United Nations of South America" from which it is currently excluded.
The need that Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbors, is another subject in the summit.
In this meaning, President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the Regional Department, he would hope to meet his homolog of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on the next week in Mexico to discuss silently the maritime difference through a judge of the CIJ requested by Bogota.
"It's possible tomorrow, I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said the President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua, who will ask you to have a discussion with this country," he subscribed.
"I hope I can tell the President Ortega that we will regulate this in the most civilised and respective way," added President Santos.
The Presidents of Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on the sabbath day where they were proposed to assist the power of the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Neto.
In the context of the summit, the Ministers of the Bloc Defence will also be gathered forward to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which trys to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Equator, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chili, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of the United States, although this last country is suspended.
The Peru ensures the presidency for the time of the regional block.
"The South America has to learn how to integrate a citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Equator, Rafael Correa, stated today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take example on Europe".
The President Correa, who participated in the VIe summit of the United Nations South America (Unasur), located in Lima, declared to the State TV, the Peru TV, that the Europeans were "interpreted in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but they had almost a country."
In this regard, he defends the project to establish a South America citizenship encouraged by the Member States of the United States.
"There is to come to the free circulation of citizens and workers in any South America countries, as it is already the case for the members of the Andine Community, but there remains more reactional areas we want to participate in the past," he warned.
Furthermore, the Equatorial President was shown for the reconstitution of the United States (OEA) with the objective to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take account of the signators of the San José Pacte on Human Rights.
Those who break our ears are never compromised, in contrast, we, South Americans, have signed it all.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights is located in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, "It is not understood that the Equator's founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
He will ensure that he doesn't regret his decision, because he himself has not trained his principles, but he has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He concluded that at the time, "There were some supply based according to which Assange would be extracted to a third country and that his procedure would not be respected."
Furthermore, it criticizes the Sweden justice that required that he should be sought on his territory to a question on a proposed sexual delay when "the own Sweden legislation allows it to be done by videoconference, what could be done from the equator in London."
Correa said that there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange was declined.
"I didn't talk to him since he was in our ambassade, but the ambassade reported me that he had a little polmonary problem, but nothing serious," said the Equatorial President.
It is possible that his physical and mental health be deteriorated by being closed in a small space without able to make free air exercise.
"This acts on the health of anyone," he concluded.
It is signed that the asylum solution agreed to Assange since June in the Equatorial Embassy of London, which would be the attribution of a safe-conduit that would allow him to go to Equator, be found among the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Judge authorities, and submits that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the end of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we don't use this word in this case, but there are permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the Great Britain, the Sweden and the European Judge authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzon, has launched a series of procedures to various European instances."
And he thinks, "If the Great Britain had agreed the safe-conduit since tomorrow, it would be done."
And if Sweden, as allowed him to do everything, and as she had already done it in other cases, Mr. Assange would ask Mr. Assange in the equator campaign in London or asked him through Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be resolved.
Correa was prospered to reaffirm himself as a defender of the freedom of pressure and declared that what he would not touch was "the mediated, the evil faith and the liars who disobey the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of the freedom of pressure are not male or perverse politicians, but bad journalists in the soldier of avidity, challenge and extorsion," he said.
Under this angle, it was grateful that it was not this kind of journalists "no bankers nor the hegenians and burgeous countries that dominate in Equator" and, instead of putting up before his election, "he would enhance revolution to continue the path and travel the good path."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the wave on the Paraguay within the Unasur at least to the next elections, saying that the organization "deemed to be held and not to touch the opportismo and the offence of the offended state" because in fact, "the law of the Paraguay Democracy was destroyed."
Who is more, the Equatorial President consists as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his colombian homolog, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate the maritime limits between the two countries by the court of the International Court of La Haye, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the time, this judgment is not respected.
It's a problem between a South America and a central country.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be exceeded by the desire to progress together.
We need to solve them together to pass and go forward.
In the same time, he said to be confident in the good resolution of the lie on maritime borders that oppose Peru and Chili in the same court, and he said that it is "benefficient to Latin America to take international instances if both countries agree to accept a judge as close as it is."
In reference to the event of his presentation as candidate to the future presidency elections in Ecuador, in order to break a third consecutive mandate, he reported that he had seen this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes too difficult."
He ensures that, if he lost the first-days of February 2013, he would be departed from the public life.
At personal level, the power has never been interested in me, but in situations like the Equators, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved by the political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this eventually victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last President's mandate and I would turn away from the political life.
If you never forgive us, I will also do it.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also refered to the new medical treatment of the President Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Cuba.
I came to discuss with the Vice-President of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that a medical treatment of routine was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This doesn't mean an absence of the health state of President Chavez," he commented.
The Equatorial State Leader participated today in Lima at the V. Summit of State and Government of the United Nations South America (Unasur), which has been fulfilled by a call to a better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Deaths connected to the sida are today from a late detection.
Fabric was 21 years when we confirmed the result of the test: seropositive.
"It's as if the sky fell on my head," he said, refering to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "my penalty" in vain.
The young man hid him in his family.
He decided to carry himself from his disease and began to report about his concern and his career was as he came to celebrate his 43th anniversary.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the civil hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he was found in 1994 after many wars.
Fabric lived with the virus of human immunodeficiency (VIH) since 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, where there were many doubts, little choices of treatment and more stigmates.
So, even the manager of an IMSS clinic did not say to him, "perhaps he was without voice."
At that time, having the sida was a death synonym.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, in ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused sufferings, "exhausted" their immunitary system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of the site in the world, in all cases after the first cases mentioned, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started a treatment at the moment and the oversight of the population in general is exactly the same," indicated the head of the HCG HCG unit, Jaime Andrade Villanue, and he takes for reference that this information was valid in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The infectionological and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists concluded that the sida was not more a mortal disease, but that the number of overliving years and quality of life depended on the level of immunitary system that present patients at the time of diagnostic, with better perspectives for those who did not use drugs: until 30 years for a CD4 of 200 and 50 years for those who were achieved by 5004.
To speak simplely, this means that for someone who receives a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years, "as he remains under control, he can live without problems until 75 years," explained the questioned scientist.
To replace this progress in its context, we need to know that the hope of life of the Mexico is today of 76 years in average.
If it is true that mortality has decreased significantly these last years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deceited persons from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (see the annual report of UNIDA), but it is also true that 60% of the patients recognised on the national database are declined since the appearance of the site.
Nothing that at Jallisco, 255 people were dead in 2011, and there were 187 dead until May of this year; however, we are sure that access to antiretroviral medicines is universal since 2005.
So why's the dead yet?
I think the problem is not from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
At the past 12 years, we have never missed medicines, the problem is that patients arrive in very advanced towns because they don't know they are infected, or then they learn it in advanced towns of disease.
He gives us a particular fact "new patients on 10 are coming when they already have an opportunity infection, which needs to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to realize more preceding diagnosis, and for this, it is necessary to propose massive disappointment tests, to all people who ask it."
The specialists and members of the Council of the State prevention of Jallisco (Coesida) are agreed on its proposal, even as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who had to make his depth test in a private laboratory, just because a friend had done it and that, although his young age, he was already portory of the sida and would suffer Kaposi's sarcome, a cancery tumor that is a current complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have the sida.
Some think they're gonna die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better I'm threaten three times a week," they say, "I'm not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I'm doing the exercise, I take my medicines.
At that day, his parents only know that he suffers a cancer.
I have a normal life, like anybody else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have a sexual life active but responsible, I take attention to me and the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted to share his intimity with MILLENIO JALISCO to help, through his witness, those who are afraid today in the walk of the World Day against the Sida.
Let them do the test, if they have taken risks, they will know early if they are seropositive and better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live as everyone, in responsibility.
His message summits the slogan of battle against the sida in 2012.
Conservatives on the account
There are many challenges between health programmes and normal citizens, supporting Ricardo Salazar, a journalist of Guadalajara, who has embarrassed the cause of HIV.
And the biggest residence in the prevention.
In all areas dedicated to this, "We have actually increased the distribution of conservatives, before we gave it one or two, now we give us a hundred packages, it's very well, but it is, that today, some have not access to the preservatives," says it.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections, adolescents are found.
The question, "What are you going to do?", putting with scarcasm and valuable judges by social workers, orientation advisers, pharmacians and health professionals, is the question that the boys don't want to hear, ensure the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that the conservatives are not only sold to accounts, but that they are found in the distributors of public tours and in the locations of young people.
It is not to encourage promiscy.
It is not more to pay the girls and the motel, as the Governor Emilio González answered when we had asked if there was a distribution of reservations within his administration.
"It's not as it works for sexuality, the best is to provide customers to the already-active persons," he underlined.
Numbers in Jalisco
13,435 cases are reviewed (12,158 of the sida and 1,317 of HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in number of new cases and cases of sida and 13th for the number of HIV diseases.
92% of pollution is sexually, 6% by blood path and 2% peripheral ways.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, because for each case recorded, there are 4 or 5 people who don't know it.
A ratified judge called by a Court of the United States ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group consensus through a commercial failure in Mexico, and the scenario provides a pre-negative negative advance for all national society with rampings in the neighbour countries and have problems of solution.
So it seems that the processes of survival of companies authorised by Mexico laws are not valid in the country at the stared bathroom, in contrast of international agreements.
In a practical view, the Court of Justice was held on 15 June last by the judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Devils for the North Texas District, leaves the Mexico society without defense against the possibility of embargo their properties beside Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main manufacturer of the Mexican to introduce the Supreme Court of the United States based on three uncoherences.
First, while the judge of the cause signed that creditors should be recorded according to the law on the failures of the United States, the Court of Call of the Fifth Circle, sitting in the New Orleans, states that the main procedure is the commercial failure formed in Mexico.
The first point would be intended to deny international procedure cooperation in the case of insolvency of enterprises with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Act for the University of the International Commercial Right was created at this end by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrary.
Secondly, the judgment established that without the inter-sociated vote, recognized in the critical mass of trade failure, the debts contracted by Vitro's officers against the mother's company, the majority required for the recognition of restructuring could not be obtained.
However, the Mexican laws recognize this opportunity.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There is a half-douzain example, among which Agremex and Mexico Commercial, which the Federal Institute of Communities had guaranteed the debts.
Furthermore, it is certain that, since he remained the votes of the officers, in all ways the creditors of Vitro who had been battled against it in the United States courts, the "vautour" funds as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, International Elliot and Liverpool Limited would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 voices against 37.
A dead data from the Court of Call.
On the other hand, Vitro was struck for the difficult situation that he would meet since 2008 without stoping the serious economic crisis that occurred in the United States, with regard to the costs of the country.
At the moment, the Gonzalez Sada family company will interview before the same call court so that the vote will be in its totality, it is to say with the five judges, since only three were voted.
The assessment review will recognize the non-profit and require the review of the process by a higher instance, in this case, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the Court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the name of the curias friend ("the Court friend") in which Vitro was detailed the procedure followed in the case of the law on trade challenges, signing that it would release the Conventions signed by both countries to put it on the same level as paragraph 15 of the law on the failure of the United States.
Furthermore, the country has been raised to the United Nations Commission's principles on the International Commerce, the rules set for transfrontal insolvency, which ensure the equity for debiers and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they argue Vitro and they argue the country.
General Bilan
The declarations of the Mexican Aviation Society's syndicates with the ex-path of the company, Gaston Azcarraga Andrade, have been held in silence for several months, this was accused of fraud administration, the Syndical Association of Aviator Pilots has already occurred problems.
The instance, chaptered by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, came to present a penalty request against the National Banker Commission and the Values accused of obstruction to justice.

As everybody knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main activist of the Posadas hotel chain.
They seats the Dragon Mart
At the end of a weekly meeting in a Caribbean University Amphitheater, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university teachers, entrepreneurs and members of the civil society have approved the creation of a large front of opposite to the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal center of sales and distribution in Mexico, Central America and Caribbean products of the large wall, with an apartment area for 150 companies.
Initially, Canazintra (Industrie and Transformation National Chamber) has succeeded to join the Governors of the South-East Area in order to oppose the monumental project that is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats on the industry.
ACTA is dead
The Government has submitted a requirement of the senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican embassor in Japan had signed the Communities Anti-Contrefaceon Agreement, known under his English cycle of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of the Integral Property, this theme is already of the old history.
As everyone knows, it was well done that the senate himself has condemned this opportunity, because it was considered as an attainment to the freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term home

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is all my life"
The basket-ball tracker "Hetin" Reyes has passed over 60 years of his life in relation to the land and, thanks to him, has traveled throughout the world.
A lot of people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the story of the local basketball as large as the hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a cerebral hemorragia was condemned in 2008, Reyes had been built in this sport over 60 years, that it would be as a low-line player, a national basket team player, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamon Vaqueros, or as President of the Basket-ball Federation.
"I have brought several casquets in the basketball through my life, and even in the same time, as when I was President of the BSN, Director of the National and President of Federation for the 1990s," Reyes reminded when a visit from the first time to him in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball is all my life."
Reyes doesn't act when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all discouraged photos and memorys that remember his inheritance out of the standards, testify.
Bayamon in the heart
From all his memories, those who love most are those who remind him his past as a player in the field of the Vaqueros team in the middle of the 50s to 1982, after having past 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"It was my best years, those I've been the most profitable because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros campionates from 1967, as manager, co-manager, or leader.
This makes many years of satisfaction, including the five campaigns disputed from 1971 to 1975.
Then I was departed in the campaign in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy was entered into the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the head of the team," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who was leader here and found in the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a customer player for you, he measures two meters.
You want it?"
It's like that at the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was natural and was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to bring a campionate, Gausse would help us to try to get another.
He rejoiced from the Vaqueros campaign with Gausse, but only a distance because he was already the great manite of feeding.
At that time, he prefered to benefit his charges and the Mincy's charges in the national team.
I remember when we first brought it to the United States during the pre-olympical tour of Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the World of 1990, where we arrived 4e and where we should have brought the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us to play the last match, said Reyes.
The 1990 World Team is the best national team you have seen?
She's part of the best, as well as the one who struck the Dream Team in the Olympics Games of 2004.
But my favorite is the Cuba-American Games, in 1991, when we brought the gold and that we put a cocktail to the United States team, which was so similar to the one who had brought the bronze during the World.
This team was not only composed from Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), there was also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not assist the world 90 because of a genius problem.
A team that may not be the best in individual terms, but she gave us a gold medal and a great joy in the pre-olympical tour of Neuquen in Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" News, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of players suspended by the embarrassment of the Panama American Games of Mar del Plata, we brought the gold against all prognoses.
What was the best player of Puerto Rico?
No doubt, it's Picullin Ortiz.
His statistics at international tours are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico did this level as Picullin did.
And this without take care of his trajectories in the different languages he played for them.
Who was the best manager of Portuguese?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In the young people, I love much the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the Federation?
It was part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that at the beginning of the 1990s, the BSN numbered to 17 teams in a saison.
What are you gonna do?
There are things I would like to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their areas and face only the teams of the other island sides in national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not strongly necessary.
At least I have seen the improvement of obligative certifications and courses for leaders, land personnel and arbitrary.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I look at my time clips on YouTube, I benefit from my kids, and, in time, I stayed at basket-ball shops.
And of course, I benefit from my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been at my side.
Death of the Larry Hagman Actor
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became a worldwide known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, more known under the name of J.R., in the TV series "Dallas", in which he incarcered a man of business without scrupules, redouble and manipulator.
Larry Hagman, including the role of magnet of the petrole without scrupule J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of availability in 1980, was declined.
He was 81.
Hagman, who was returned this year in the role of J.R. in a new saison of "Dallas", was decided on Friday evening complications of a cancer, according to a communicated from the family sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back to his dark town of Dallas, playing again the ironical role he loved the most," said the family.
Larry's family and his neighbor friends were with him in Dallas on the feast day of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interpreted his wife's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he was declined in a Dallas hospital, told his press-tailed, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought the joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, drunk, efficient and talentive, and he's gonna miss me very much.
"It was a person of exception and he lived the life on the ground," said Gray in a communicate.
The doctors had diagnosed a hepatitis circus in Larry Hagman in 1992, and he recognized that he had been a lot of drink for many years.
In 1995, he had detected a fat damn tumor and he had a shepherd.
A few years ago, Hagman was made known to the TV in the role of a normal type in the series "Jinny of my dreams" distributed by the NBC chain of 1965 to 1970.
In this, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, a astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductor genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and that he brought her home.
He also played in two comités that remained a little time at the antine, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
From its roles in the cinema, we find good roles received by the critical in the "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was grateful to his governor's interpretation of J.R. that Larry Hagman knew his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing Clan and their neighbors were distributed from April 1978 to May 1991.
The Slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspension around a full emotion episode in which Hagman's personality has almost murdered, has generated specializations in the whole world and millions of dollars played in parises.
Thanks to this, among others, the series has achieved an audience record at that time.
When the answer was discovered in an episode of November 1980, 41 million telespectors were in the middle before their screen and made "Dallas" the second divergence program in the world, after the final ephod of "MASH" in 1983, which had collected 50 million telespectors.
It was the beautiful sister of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot her over.
J.R. had made it courageous, and then he had been threatened to accuser prostitution if she would not leave the city, but others had also reasons to attack it.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatisfacable man but in charismatic smile: a malhonote and an infidel marriage who tried to interact his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what he needs for J.R." Hagman in 1988.
We should write, "It's the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagonist of the original series, was reminded of this Friday of Hagman as a "grand man, both on the small screen and in life."
It is unforgettable, and unrecommendable, for million fans through the world, and in the heart of each of us, who had the chance to know him and love him.
Ten episodes of the new "Dallas" have been divorced a few months ago with a great success on the TNT string.
The registration of five episodes has already been completed for the second saison and a sixth is currently implemented, has reported the string.
For now, Warner or TNT chain have not communicated on the way Hagman's death will be integrated in the series.
Originary of Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actry and singer Mary Martin, who knows the celebration with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a boyfriend when she gave her the day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the scenas of the teaters in New York at the beginning of the 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It's that he met the young decoratory of Sweden inside Maj Axelsson and that he married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrations reside.
In 2001 he intitled his memory "Hello Darlin": Tall (and absolutely true) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin): J.R.
"I have nothing written in this book that can hurt someone or affect it in any way," he said to the press at that time.
After his greffe, he became a active military of organs and worked as voluntary work in a hospital to assist the patients who were concerned.
"I advise them, I trust them, I come with them when they come to operate and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them a little comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it's not easy for a little moment, but it's gonna go well."
He was also military against the tobacco and participated in several campaigns.
A training course from the "End of the World" begins
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and heroes and climate refrigeration.
This semester, when the teacher of Stuart Charme decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had launched there an irresistible hammer: the end of the "great detail" of the Maya calendar on 21 December, where many people were reflected as the evidence of the end of the imminente world.
But Professor Charme had no idea of what he expected during the following months: the Catastrophic Sandy, a fiscal gouffre that some have called "The Armageddon of the Deed" and a growing conflict that implied Israel, the place where the Christian theory of the end of the time thought that the apocalypse would be declared.
"I didn't know that it would be the most apocalyptic semester I have never known," said Professor Charme to his students of the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what happened in the world today, as if we were 30 days later and we told it, it was a very good period.
And we need to remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And it's not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will be in the theory, the last of the story.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker dispenses the course "Medias, cultures and ends of the world."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and heroes and climate refrigeration.
"We analyze this because these ideas have prolifered with time," he said, "and the way they offer hypothetic scenarios guide a certain human conduct.
If the nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could be swallowed up.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic theme and study how they can be compared with real life examples.
"I tried to report my students about what was possible, probably, trustable and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main camp of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of the History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjoined professor of the History of Art and Anthropology, made team to give a course, just titled "The end of the world".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world wouldn't be lost," said Professor Restall.
Although the "imminent disaster", students should study, create projects and pass their final tests.
In Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed by the Apocalypse, which does not leave students other choices but to work "to even even the end of the world supposedly," said Restall.
The courses have been revealed enough popular.
"He has been complete in two hours," said Restal on his course destined to high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received mails by e-mails several weeks before the beginning of the semester, part of people who asked whether there was still a place.
Students, for their part, make sure the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's amazing to see what people are able to do to strengthen themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and socialology of 23 years, originary of Haddonfield, New Jersey, of the University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, that it is secular or religious, is only a question of consolidation, or of refusal.
Will Wekesa, a student in Psychology and Infirmery of 25 years, tell me I have seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I never heard about a course that taught this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But no students asked, and even less a teacher, didn't believe in the end of the world of 21 December.
"Our first project was trained from the Maia prophecy, and in some way we discredited it," says Julie Zegle, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and original of West Chester.
Mayas has never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, stated Restall.
But I convince that there is an anxiety linked to the apocalypse in the western culture, reaching for several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet offered a shooter of these specifications.
"In other places of the globe, people don't think of that," he assures.
It's in most of the English world.
Joseph Dougherty, a teacher of religiousness of the University of The Salle who gives schools to Philippines this year, answered rapidly when we asked him if he knew that we were given schools here on the end of the world.
"The Philippines don't participate in the end of the world," he answered us, as if it was a exception from a higher authority.
We have a thanks to Dad.
Restaurant is noted that during the years, it was spoken of many suspects of the last judgment, and it states that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people will begin immediately to think about the next date" or to philosopher on the fact that 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world is lost.
Students and teachers take the date at least.
Many told us that they thought they were going to "the end of the world."
"Soon, I call friends and we go together," commented Samira Ford, a student in 20-year communities.
