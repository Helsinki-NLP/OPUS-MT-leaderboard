A Republican Strategy to address the Research Election of Obama
The leadership forces of the Republicaries justify their policy with the need to fight the election.
However, the Brennan Center is the last for a mythos, encouraging that the choice in the United States is greater than the number of people killed by the slider.
The Republican law officers have signed only 300 cases of choice in 10 years in the United States.
One is sure that these new provisions will be negatively affected by the election participation.
In this regard, these measures are shared on the democratic system of the United States.
In accordance with Canada, the United States are responsible for the implementation of the elections in individual countries.
In this meaning, most of the American governments have reported new laws, which have violated the procedure for registration or urgency.
This phenomenon has won after the elections of November 2010, which could be signed by 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries.
Thus, 180 law designs were introduced alone in 2011, which restricted the execution of the election right in 41 countries.
The new election officers require that the choices make light indication and a indication of the U.S. citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws are also decreased by the timespaces for the previous vote, which declares the right for invalid to register themselves in the election day, and States citizens decline the election right for a judge.
Before the election of 2006, no United States requested the electorers to show a light-screen exhibition.
Indiana was the first state of contract that has received such requirements.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the competence of Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities were encouraged to express this practice to other countries.
During the past two years, they promoted the legislation designs in 34 Member States, with which the electorers were designed to show a light-screen indication.
It is important to note that the US citizens in relation to Quebec do not have any universal indication card like the hospital security cards.
In fact, 11% of the U.S. citizens, 21 million elected persons, have no light indication from a government authority of their State.
Furthermore, there are five million new electorers in 2012 not about such evidence.
However, it is often to pay more than 100 dollars to get the required evidence.
From the new restrictions, young people, minorities and people with lower income are very strong.
In fact, there are 25% of the African Americans, 15% of the people with a income of less than $35,000, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the choices between 18 and 29 years are not about the required light indication.
That's enough.
Students who are considered as a pioneer, who are more popular for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their light indication from their establishment.
On the other hand, the same States will allow members of Angel or Jagds, which are more stronger for the republic side to use the cards for the elections issued by these United States.
There is no Member State for the election for 2004 requested an indication of the State citizenship.
Arizona was the first contract, which introduced such a request.
Since 2011, a thousand states have adopted legislation required by the electorers to demonstrate their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly restricted to limit Spanish voices.
Because it is in hand that two of the three Spanish choices to prevent the democratic party.
Furthermore, republic lawyer 2011 has promoted laws in eight Contracting States, with which the registration of elections has been made on the election day.
Furthermore, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide the choices to provide assistance to register themselves.
These restrictions are not without effect.
For example, the campaigns for the electoral registration have contributed to the general elections 2004 to register about at least 10 million national citizens.
Because by the measures adopted since 2009, the participation of the registration of new electorers 2010 was reduced to 17% in comparison to 2006.
Moreover, the Republican lawyers have adopted legislation in five other contracts to decrease the period for the previous voting.
For example, in the general elections of 2008 in Florida, 33% of the electorers who were previously chosen, African Americans, although only 13% of the electorers of the United States.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
Lastly, only 11% of the choices, but 24% of the citizens who have chosen forward.
In addition, 76% of the choices have made the white out only 46% of the choices chosen forward.
Of course, democratic lawyers and their attachors have declined the energy of the legislation which include the registration of the electoral.
More law designs were blocked by the Vetos of the Democratic Government.
The Secretary-General of the United States has committed to ensure the most extreme laws.
They could restrict the disasters partly.
For example, only 16 of the 34 Member States have adopted laws that require the presentation of a light exhibition.
However, the new introduced rules in 2012 will be doubtless exceeding the execution of the election law.
Democratic crisis deploys the party-politic nature of the laws agreed and see in them a clear goal the impact of the results in the 2012 states.
A report of the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those States who have agreed with these laws shall exceed 171 of 270 votes required in the election group to win the President.
It is too early to ensure that these amendments of the legislation on the election system will have significant effects on the results of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one is sure that these new provisions will be negatively affected by the election participation.
In this regard, these measures are shared on the democratic system of the United States.
Prostat review: should the test be made or not?
The PSA test has sometimes aware of wrong results with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical injections.
This leads to stronger steps of men who have already been concluded for the implementation of pre-identification tests.
Whether the test should be made or not
We have received the opinion of two fabrics.
In the studies conducted in the United States, several factors of control groups have been made, so it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to conclude that a difference in the death of patients is with and without prejudice.
This study also shows that the probability of education of metastases is higher than 30 to 40% if no previous recognition has been carried out.
Therefore, I recommend the test since a age of 50 or 40 years, if you have a direct friend who has already been sick at the prostate rebs.
Mans of African American origin also have a higher risk.
The most important is to take the right decision when a disease was recognized.
There are crowds, aggressive and others indolents.
The patients need to be really understanding of the risk of his bloody disease by demonstrating the possible options in which the prostate rebelle can remain unbehanded if he does not affect the quality of life on long visibility and decide in these cases more for a active monitoring of the disease.
Today, there is no treatment in many men with which you recognized a crowd is not aggressive, and there is no threat for their life.
They will prevent a active monitoring and offer them a treatment when the disease is forwarded.
The criteria for a decision that should be treated and who is not.
That is why I recommend the implementation of the test.
However, it is important to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be executed or not.
In cooperation with the International Union for Urology, Movember has developed a tool to assess the PSA test forward and night.

Preventions of the disease
I'm sorry, there's no wonderful instruments for prevention of carbons.
Instead of the progress in the research, the acceptance of a healthy life is the best way to reduce the risk to be sick to him.
It is estimated that 30% of the carbon diseases could be prohibited if all eating good and moved enough.
"If there's no smoker more, this value would increase at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian Caribbean company.
However, it is said that at least 10% of the diseases are caused by destruction.
More of us remain completely unclean.
For the Canadian Caribbean society, the fight against the tabak dependence remains a priority, although the return of the number of rubbers.
The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lenscrebs.
It is also a risk factor for several other carbon sorts.
It hurts the health of humans.
"Today there's still 1,5 million in Quebec. Raucher," advertises André Beaulieu.
Increasing data: 10 years after the face of the cigarettes, the risk to die in the carbon is reduced for half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Health Society, the surveys and the Adipositas also promote the exhaustion of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk for breast-, grimmdarm-, mastdarm-, food routes, bathrooms and scarlets.
"The research shows that a regular body activity is protected during the whole life against Grimmdarm Creb," adds.
The food
The organization also recommends to limit the loss of red flesh.
In too large quantity it increases the risk to be disease with a grimm or massacre.
The structures should also be cut off.
Conservation of flesh by skins, trunks or salts can lead to education of carcinogenes.
"Later can lead the body cells to the development of blood," explains he.
Vitamine
In the last years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin additives and carbons.
Their studies are now not fair.
After the Canadian blood company, the studies of Vitamin E are contrary.
While a study has discovered the reduction of the risk of prostate rebs, another showed more increase.
The effect of Vitamin D on the crowd was also not clearly shown.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu, how important it is to talk to his doctor about his minds and his family preference.
"The execution of a previous identification test does not lead to blood."
The Higgs Boson analysed
The announcement of the probable detection of the Higgs Bosons has received a certain view in the last room, and it is a good reason.
You believe in the fact that this boson is nothing less than the mechanism which is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally it is about the last part that exists from the standard model - our best or "the less failure" statement of nature and the behavior of the material - but empirically not observed yet.
But for the physicist, it's not fully sure that it's really about the higgs.
We know without the darkness of a doubt that we have a real new part, and that it is strong like the Hyggs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, this seems to be confirmed by new data that have been submitted in a large physical congress in Kyoto, but there are no more data to be completely safe.
However, let's say that it actually happens about the Higgs, because it seems to be just a small risk to smoke, and we look at what is going on.
In this world there is a weak unaccessible law that affects that two objects cannot be present in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too strong because you are weak.
For even if the party physical is a real amazing world, it appears that it also applies to them such a law: the Pauli'sche exclusion principle, which indicates that two parts cannot set the same room at the same time when they are in the same "contingent state", where this "state" exists in large and entireness of some of their properties.
The physicists often share the parts in two categories.
The good citizens who are called Fermion are in a bowl, and are wisely obeying Pauli's principle.
And in the other, the bosons, a simple band of anarchists, which nothing is holy - in any case, not this principle, which means that they can be in fact at the same time in the same place.
These bosons are in the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Labors (the rest is absolutely amazing) in two groups: the measures that we don't be treated here and the "power parts" by extending the great powers of the nature and to which the Higgs-Boson would be along with.
But it must be mentioned that these bosons are not all that kind of exotic creatures as you can think.
If you are in the situation to read this chronic, then only thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photos or the "light parts" that is the "bote" of the electrical power.
If a part of a electrical launch or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field will be exactly "stopped" at this place, as well as a kissel stone that was thrown into a rock.
With this "smoking" there is an electromagnetic weight (Light, Infrarot or Ultraviolet training, etc.), and this weight is nothing other than a photon, and then one of the bosons of the "tractors of power".
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "stopped" to show this boson.
However, the Higgs field is very faster than the electrical field; the reacher must get very high energy, a little comparable with a crashed team, which can only be destroyed by a very large rock.
That is why a big party-leather as the CERN requires - the large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to get such energy.
Analogy with the electrical field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all parts and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnete, do this, but others, for example, would never keep a white paper from itself at the hair.
And the same way, not all parts of the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass while others (as other photos) have no mass.
For what can all these researchs now be " good," Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, they serve the check of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicians to examine all the difference between the observations and the previews of the SM.
There are still many physicians who most likely hope that these differences are found because the smallest difference is opening a door to a "new physical" and some leather of the model can stop.
You need to say that the last is a big manning, because there is no statement for the gravity (ups!) and the dark material that offers about 80% of the material of the universe ( again ups!).
However, such differences were not found in CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these researchs for the general population are more difficult to prevent, but it would be wrong to accept that there was no failure.
However, in the past 60 years, the laser pioneers did not convince that their work would resolve such a revolution.
They have seen scientific applications, but no more.
In fact, the dead physiker Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was found in the 1960s, and the 1962 himself developed the first duration slider (which was first rolled) - already said that the laser was considered before as a "labor player".
Let's see...
Furthermore, applications can also be issued from all tools that include the research.
For example, Willard Boyle again developed a small light sensor during his work in the optic.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor serves today all digital cameras worldwide as "Eye" and introduced him the Nobel Price for Physics 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that the activities of the LHC will change our life weakly, but it means that you can really never know it...
Palliative Pleasure - the best way to die...
With its committee for "Dead in Würde" Quebec shortly discussed the exact question of life.
The debate must be taken again in courts, although a law design is prepared.
However, it remains still much to do in this important area.
The Devoir has tried to consider it closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostat reb, who recorded him, left him a period of two years.
"You gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said in his bed in his house for the palliative Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he was coming on the day.
"Anyway, it's always a shock that you can't be ready," he said.
The disease makes her work: an inheritable difficulty allows him to go alone on the toilettes and even eat themselves.
On the table before a nice lunch, he wants to help himself at the eating.
It is hard to smile him and to talk to the strangers who are busy for him to bring him his medicine and offer him a bath.
The strength of the normal death.
"My greatest desire is that you're stealing my fault because it's disturbing," he shared.
Some hours later, the team found a healthy food for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we know that a man's smoking in the road," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the Victor Gadbois.
Return in the childhood phase is an inacceptable encouragement for some persons.
"This is declined from the capacity of the person," to add a step, he establishs.
For, according to the view of several people who work in the Palliative office, there are great events in the middle of these steps.
The patients who are inserted in the house for the palliative Victor board are all painted at the carbon.
You have a maximum expectation of three months.
In this station, they will be overcome from the doctors and sisters who are concerned about them, not more with such "healous" pfleges.
For Mrs. A., 89 years, it is the worst fear, "conscious and extinction" to die.
But by the disease, I really learned my children.
"I have good children," adds them.
"I have no desire in my life," she says, before she accepts that you put her a mask that helps her at the atmosphere.
She waits in the next days, while another visit to her son who comes from Italy.
In the house of Victor Gadbois, you offer a group of free bodies and aid for food.
The palliative ability will be used if there is no other possibilities.
To handle the dead advocators.
In Quebec, 11.700 inhabitants are a bed for the palliative officers.
It's very little if you take care of that we all die one day.
Here the life will continue under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Even on the level of body, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You will give the dead to the devotion a brief with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabeticers have no longer to control their blood suckers.
And death is part of all day.
Yesterday night we served Mr. X a beer who died during the night.
Tonight, his son will drink the beer at the feet of the dead.
"We help people and patients equally," reports the Pflege Director Nathalie Savard.
It's not a day like the other.
Besides a 93-year old man who has the last family collection in the court and has been protected good from his head kiss, while he is attached to his honour, a young man died from 36 years old, who is excited from his parents, his wife, and his two little children, in a tragic way after he tried to survive everything.
"For six months, three to five beds are always involved with blood patients in less than 45 years," described Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients invited home Victor Gadbois come from their apartment, 47% from the hospital.
The problem of the Access to the Palliative Population
It says that 77% of the Canadians do not have access to the Palliative Population, for example, to a penalty that should lead to the pain of patients when the end stadium of their life has been achieved, even to home, in hospital, or in a pflegehouse.
And several organizations, such as the Victor Gadbois and the society for high palliative fields in the large room of Montreal, are specialized more or less except for blood patients.
That is exactly this great independence in the health care of Quebec, in view of several specialized doctors in the palliative office of the decision of a law on the regulation of death assistance and assisted Suicide.
Since the month of October, it is a manifest in the environment that was signed by prominent personalities of the Palliative Pleasures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to visit their obligation to a such initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not sufficiently able to ensure that all rights have a high-quality calibrative ability before you accept to transfer to death.
Before, she says, I have seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the pressure, without having taken measures to their lending.
I'm afraid that the patients want to die only because they don't get appropriate health care.
And in the same time several oxygen treat their patients even the worst prognoses until the last day.
The survival chances of Helene Richard was already minimum when she interrupted a serious chemotherapie.
When I reported to my ookologist that I'm interrupting the treatment, she replied to me that she believes that I'm going to fight, she told her.
But she told me I was at the end!
No entirely powerful eggs
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have requested to die thanks to the personal that it has not been placed in this desire after their pains have been declined from a team of the Palliative Population.
However, it must be clearly stated that the Palliative Population is not entirely powerful in the disease treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, the leader of the Palliative offices of the high Palliative offices of the Great Montreal Monreal does not refer to 8% of the patients to a disease treatment.
At the end of life, the doctors are so often returned to the terminal seat, which is over there, to enter the patients as sporadical or permanent until the time of his death.
We can't do so longer than if we don't make this side of pain.
Patients without disease will always have the possibility to return to this terminal sedition.
The patients who do not have pains say the same point, "I want to die."
But that doesn't mean weird, "I want you to sleep in me," but "I want my pains to be disappointed."
The implementation of this report was possible because of a Canadian Health Research institute of journalism.
Immobiliating channels large extents in Quebec
The officers of the streetbuilding, the company of the Building Agency, the political party and the Italian Mafia specialists tell each day what they know about a great "system" in the building, employment, policy, workers and mafioso.
A "Industrie", which was very rich for the stealing numbers of Quebec, in particular in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's wonderful how the system has disappeared since you have taken drastical measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, Secretary-General in Quebec and the former leader of the police of Montreal.
The Skandal was discovered by him because of an incoming investigation of the conventions in relation to the Treaty on Strategy Works in Quebec, which has only approved the delegated Ministry.
The "Douchesneau report" established a direct connection between industry, secret funding of parties and employees.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he states, "the transfer Minister only shares a billion of dollars to the contracts," because some of them were cut off their instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "the two citizens have already brought to the case," adds, in the hope that it is able to show the tactics behind the individuals."
An 2011 called in life, permanent anticorruption unit
The 2011 calling in life, permanent anticorruption units are also undertaken with their forces to test economic, products and analysis of the Government.
Furthermore, the cops of the "Marteau-Team", which have affected the "kanalization card" of Montreal at the artificial exhibition of the contracts...
In the last week, she has taken home investigations and committed accusations against the condemnation and corruption against community mandaters such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the citizens of a preside.
The next in the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who was just returned from his office as a citizen of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He will be deemed to retain the smooth payer in the expenditure of public tasks.
Expressly, the rest of the street building engineering of Montreal, as well as Italian origins, such as Tony Acccurso and Lino Zambito.
Lastly, he has considered the Commission by declaring the functionality of the "system" for the maintenance of public tasks.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal for a contracter connected with the Mafia, which overcomes the money to the Union Montreal, the party of the citizens General Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has held his hand in the 2000-year-old age, in which he gave more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (ca. 68,000 euros) to provincial party, especially to those who were in the power.
He also began to organize an illegal training for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canalization contracts from which the costs of him were artificially reached
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked without running.
The former Building Agency Gilles Surprenant described this from the Commission: in ten years he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tourns, restaurants and Eishockey games, as well as billers of 736,000 dollars as a reward for canalization contracts whose costs are usually reached.
Other travel officers of the streetbuilding have provided that they have smoothed themselves by getting the accounts with false additives at least 30-40%.
Martin Dumont, Mr. Tremblay, also accused a representative of the party of the citizen master, that he was aware of a shadow house, who filled his box with black money.
According to these exemptions, Mr Tremblay returned the beginning of November, which Montreal struck in a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first of Montreal, the alarm struck.
As a citizen leader of the citizens of Rivière-des-priries, in the east of the island, she declined from 2010 against the sale of a community basis that for 5 million dollars and was sold for 1,6 million buyers in the tree immobilier market.
70% black money in choice patterns
From the investigation, which is finally conducted, she says that she's "to a ground that allows to understand the functionality of the systems underneathed by the Americans to stop the evil and to break the wrongdoers."
She says that the procedure is "hearted, but positive."
We are to smooth the desires, however, only one for Montreal, and a surveillance to prevent a return of the demanding practices.
How can you make it easier?
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "Agency has rolled several hundreds of million dollars," but, in particular, thinks about the role of "Mandarts trackers who are about the tactics in the pictures," if they were not developed in the field!
From a part of 70% black money in the financing of the choice campaigns in Quebec, he said, "I have been said that this is only a hard abstract of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to restrict the costs of party to 100 dollars, which would not be changed in the situation: "If the costs of choice are not strictly limited, black money will be in the policy."
He recommends a complete monitoring of the system for public tasks and the financing of the parties: "We can't fall deeply; we can rebuild the house on a solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story hurts the international view of Quebecs and those of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau requests those who laugh about it to put a look in their own front...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this saison you have adopted a new extent with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it by a personal view, but also by the new size of the PSG.
Great gamers are coming.
Every day I'll make progress on her side.
The technical person also gave me much.
These elements arise me every day to improve my game level.
And in a game, it's still easier.
It's all quick in the football.
But I'm not gonna break up.
From my beginning in the center of the preparating training of the INF Clairefontaine until my time at St. Etienne I have always progressed.
So you use the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses of this summer are usually used to exceed games very high level.
You also know that every training unit is exhausted.
This makes a player like me to offer the stress and wants to give his best.
Finally, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relationship with my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele who played at the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti replies all technical respects.
In line 1 there is no comparable person today, and he counts the best trainers of Europe.
He looks back to a rich experience and wins many titles with respective agreements.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I've brought a serious conversation with him.
I was just getting out of a destruction series.
The confidence he has set in me is also a statement for my efforts.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG saison?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the spitze officer.
But we're laughing in the front.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified us in this way for the axefinal.
What is the goal of the Treaty in this competition?
We'll try to come as far as possible.
It's all possible from now.
However, we will have to talk to our words against very good European humanitarians.
First, we want to be the first of our group before porto, so that we can make the replacement of the axefinals as a home game.
Can the PSG be a great European Union in short look?
He already has the Budget for that...
In order to be a great European Agreement, Paris must win the title and make a name long-term.
This isn't the case today.
Financially, the PSG is the means to accept specific forms of this proposal.
Would there be a great deal to win not the title in the Ligue 1 how this was in the last case of the case?
Of course, this would be a great deception.
This year is really in our heart to deal with this title.
In the last saison, we were close to it.
In May, we were deceived because we were strong enough to get out of the wind.
We've finished the saison with a very strong ransom.
We ended with 79 points.
Normally, you should be Master with 79 points...
But another manner, the Montpellier, has received a better saison.
I think this year is right.
Even if the big marriage marriage like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux around the title, I think we have the witness to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what was invested and the players we have is normal that many of us will be expected.
We accept it completely.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that you can imagine us, it's something far frustrating.
You ask what people are still waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to create a game concept.
A marriage is built up with the time.
In the Champions League, we have proved strong.
Look at Manchester City, a party of two saisons is not allowed to qualify themselves for the axefinal, and the same is also a great expenditure!
In view of the invested summs you believed to break your game with 15 points forward!
This said that our guests and the French Mastership would be left except attention.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last saison, were "booted by this new PSG."
This shows that the ligue 1 is amazing.
I hope we will be the wedding guests in May and tell us that we finally win them.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the efforts of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
To be so better that you're talking about a "Zlatan dependence".
That means that Ibrahimovic is a leadership and shoot many gates.
That's why he came and proves that he's the star of the Ligue 1.
All around where he played, he led before the eyes that he was a great player and a world star.
In the marriage we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who reject him.
What he has done is really exciting.
This points to the others to improve their game level.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best protectors in the world, also allows all others to progress.
How did the EM 2012 live with the French national society?
It's like a discovery.
I was in my heart to share this EM.
I'm sorry, my destruction has stopped me to get out of the game time.
I have seen things from which I have been strengthened.
Today, I'm able to make good games in the national society.
This was since my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what happened in Ukraine, we have gone to our teaching, and today we have to make a formal behavior on the day.
What is your opinion on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has received a lot of promising results.
We have a good position in the Qualification Group for the WM.
The National Trainer is stretched, is close to the players, and it's going to win.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had obtained his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does this make an attractive game designed in Spain on 16 October (1:1)?
This game has given us a review.
Everyone has used himself for all others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I've never experienced a comparable game in my carriers.
Bitcoin is possible for payments and sales without banks
The comparison of the current monetary expenditure on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and editing costs between participants.
Furthermore, as often in these technologies, a political vision is made: the convincement that the current monopol system leads to financial crisis.
In fact, the bitcoin found by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is a virtual monetary (but in dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchanges such as Bittorrent, which allows direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been achieved.
Some thousand web pages accept Bitcoin as spending or as payment equipment.
After the Bitcoin currency in June 2011 a maximum rate of 30 dollars (23 euros), he fell five months later to 2 dollars before he gets around 10 dollars (the currency is located on the web site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly increasing in comparison to the world trade of real monetary or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown it in a report published in October on virtual money interests.
She describes Bitcoin as "the virtual payment with the greatest success", "in concurrence with the dollar or euro" and "like the original payments."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money such as the "credits" used to prevent a video game that can win or buy through games (and sometimes return).
The Facebook social network also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and edited by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are the same time guarder of the account book, testers, money emitants, buyers and vendors.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is found in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose another address to ensure anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is signed electronicly by a double encryption system.
In this way the network can check the authentication of the transaction.
The help of the content of the file is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins treated are available in the total network of the public accounts.
The determinant step is to put this new transaction into this book.
This is about a mathematical task that is started on the computer, where the winds who are a type of providing central banks are the privilege of adding these additional lines.
It is about a threshold of the file, such as the converting of a large file to a shorter and unexpected electronic fingerprint.
The computer "to take" the new transaction and add a number before the whole "hacked".
The objective is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can check whether it is correct.
The transaction is therefore continuously linked to the box of all other transactions, and every change would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay with the same money twice twice (with 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions from the network would be validated and the other remains without link, because both different fingerprints have both.
The computer who solved the task has 50 bitcoins.
To prevent an inflation, this offer will be regularly half, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in the circuit are therefore limited to 21 million, but to a hundred million systems are shared, which allows a certain gamespace...
Furthermore, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement of the calculation.
The life of the network has already been high and depths.
The web pages offering services for bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoin devices were locked.
"The used weapon does not affect the actual protocol," ensures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports the possibilities of the money weight by helping this anonymous service.
However, the Bargeld also shows this guy.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuses the speech of this type.
From others, such as the WordPress blog Plattform, they will be accepted.
Currently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analysed the account book in Israel and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not in the circuit.
In November, a "Mega-Schluss venture" was started.
"Trieth thousand dollars were income," Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company, converts the bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who also is author of a book on this money, believes the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a non-connected payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin uses to validate transactions that are more valuable.
In addition, the container manages his identity and then can remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with handhelds, and the last needs not install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify only a address that can be photographed and recognised by a phone, gives Pierre Noizat, who ensures that he has thousand users.
It is to describe a general trend that will be considered the most stronger horizontal equipped systems in the hierarchical systems.
"It's going to do some time until Bitcoin is translated, but 2013 could be an endpoint," he prognoses.
The ECB considers the rest of its report to revalue the various risks today as high as high as a result of the success of this currency.
We're departed from Afganistan.
And then?
French forces have left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Capita and Surobi).
The NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014.
It is at the time that the Afghanistan Armies reach the possession of their territory, and that the aggressive population decides their future without expecting all of us.
In particular, we have forced the Afganian buildings by looking for them as terrorists.
And ourselves were killed with our 88 soldiers, and the losers and the transgressors.
The Taliban exists from external extremists, ancient leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from buildings who refuse a weaponsed outside presence, as in the time of the Soviet.
They want to defend their age hundreds and archaic traditions, even if they have attached their Dschihadists, Pakistans, Arabs, Usbekens and Tads.
Tolerated, sometimes from the local obstacles, will not be the last when western countries are discussed.
The refugee of the French forces from support point in Nijrab, which I have observed by one of the woods planted with mandel trees, which was financed by the French credit.
Cabul has obtained the overflowed ship- and panzer convoys of Hubschrappers without attacks.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no struggles more than the Taliban in Kabul.
Since its increasing margin from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
In that time Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed because of the battle of the various surrounded groups of war.
Their power has been considered as a kind of freedom and return to security.
The Afghanistan women have paid the price for the exploitansis of the buildings overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not been improved until today.
Ancient Mudschhaddin, the Afghanistan Government and the current Taliban have the common desire to maintain women in a subordinated position.
The most important persons of the antisowite war have come back to the power of 2001.
They have changed themselves to business makers by adopting the principles of the Government to sell them as a buildland to flews from Iran and Pakistan and so benefits from the massive American distribution of submissions.
They took themselves into a challenge, and most of them were not involved in the fighters themselves.
As I heard it in the campaigns, people want to be a government that doesn't collect from them.
Many young people want to leave the country as those who could use the American uses: the capital flow is significant.
The young people set the war and their ideas.
While their exil in Iran or Pakistans, they have contacted the modern world, and they have taken their benefits.
At least 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who don't want to return to the exploitans of the individual parties or to corrupt certain leadership forces will have to be available for workplaces.
All, both armed parties, are obtained by mobile phones; the TV with its Turkish series showing a modern world is in general.
A army now exists.
Will the authorities who are under their command officers be considered legitimately?
Ancient comandaries of anti-soviet war are already trying to restore the miles in the provincies that will be raised by the power of the Central Government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities had to benefit from a certain decentralization in the example of the western nations, but through the establishment of the Ministry's Office since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make him a centralized State with a strong preside officer.
President Karzai does not want external controls, especially the elections planned for April 2014.
Nevertheless, his country has been dependent on the outside aid since the 50 years and has been long ago.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functionable ships are not available and important evaluation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; outside oil and meat is nothing produced.
The private initiative will be allowed to be applied.
In a country that was based on 30 years of war, a State control of infrastructure would be required.
The reputation was extended to Afghanistan's increasing ground costs.
This still enhances the impression that western countries were only in place to enable them.
Without energy to process the ice or cooking for the place, or without transporting instruments for exporting on the mountains is not possible.
The Chineses have already left the compound of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) have made their exhibitions on the rich budgetary location and remain the most important workers of the provincies.
One day, it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistans, depending on imports and exports, rebuild normal relations.
The refugee of the French fighters was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation Treaty views traditional assistance: girls and young men, Institute for French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural area, support of the archeological delegation.
Since 2009, a "civil military actions" of the Ministry for Defence (Cimic), which has been established in 2012, has been carried out in thousands of many common works and measures for agricultural sanction, and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to win "Herman and spirits" and the impossible task of the Agreement of Agriculture and Public Actions.
These works that were required for many local work forces have been helped to submit the surface: assessment, drinking, drinking water, renewing, areas, land protection and increased agricultural uses.
What memories do we let us return from two billion euros after military expenditure?
A much more vulnerable budget will contribute to improve local life conditions that often are very hard in this height of more than 2000 meters.
In the news, twelve write requests have been entered in small agricultural proposals from the communities of the Province Capisa.
In order to save the agricultors from the extern groups, what their own opinions is their desire, the continuement would be smaller, well-controlled and directly required for civic assistance to their benefits.
A comparison with the breaststage in Egypt
It's a new poker game of President Mohammed Mursi.
During the Egyptians in relation to the declaration of repair, which leads to him the unlimited full power, more than ever, he decided to put everything on a card.
In the surprise of all, he reported on midnight that the next day the Congress meeting will be concluded by its final statement.
A week ago, the State head of this plenary had offered two additional months for the end of his work.
The Egyptians are now supported for a proceeding, multiplely modified text since about two years, which is low to the institutional stability and leads to a legal course.
This new initiative has only contributed to a stronger place in the country.
For his geniers, the President has stopped in his "autcratic delirium", while he continues to "the word" and "the right with feet."
On the sides of his advocators, it is a way to finish the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to deal with the transition process.
A reference should be held within 14 days.
A very short time that the brothers will move to face their proposals to explain to the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the Presidents, there is also a way and way to recover its public and democratic legality while the protest is in the whole country.
After strengthening in an interview with the American weekview Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that Egyptians will be proudly voted.
Once the Egyptian people with this advantage will be put to a explicit vote: "If you are steadfast for my design or I keep the unrestricted fulfillment," the last time, after accepting the conception, it should be a final end.
85 of the most islamist members of this conscious congregation have agreed the text yesterday in a wonderful atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals has not been fulfilled.
Before the Middle November statement, they used themselves because they think that they were not able to implement their views.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have treated the same way.
To get the decision-making capacity, it was added to all 11 members of the first morning.
Some are close to Moslem Brothers.
It is not surprised that most of the articles have been condemned.
However, the commentors found that the only opinion differences of the day... in the hour of prayer were expressed, because some members of the Greece of the opinion were that the penalty of the conscious congregation did not exactly go.
The text, which has been concluded yesterday evening, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 that all the attention has been taken to himself, finally remains identically with the consideration of 1971 and considers that "the principles of Scharia are the main source of the law."
The salafistic parties, for which the establishment of the Islamic Law is an important requirement, had the hope to replace the "the principles" by "the rules" which had been possible to stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified, a evidence for their good will and their respect against the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Sureness" replies the liberals that only consider it as a proposal proposal.
Because they follow the islamism of the opinion on other articles.
These are particularly Article 220 in the eye that the University of Al-Azhar recognizes a ratified function, especially in relation to the monitoring of the conformity with the laws of Scharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is urgent because "the people who are invited to a opinion are not selected and have no democratic legality.
You can see the first signs of a theokracy here."
The fears of the Liberals will also be considered by the fact that the next director of this university is increasingly less than the present.
"The time is not to recognize a specific religious commitment.
With this opinion, we remain in the framework of the citizen state.
Most jurists who have worked in this text are not Ulema, but Academic, which have been developed in part in the French system," said Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctor work on the Egyptian transaction.
However, he says, "the fact that in relation to Article 220 may be a majority because the useful terms are described to the religious words.
It is particularly related to the "Fiqh" [islamic law, Anm.d. Red].
And in the future, the question may be issued, in which civil judges are competent to decide on."
Besides his religious aspect, the yesterday text will be criticized strongly because of the long-term powers he gives the President of the Republic.
Moslem Brothers argued that these compared to the old regime are clearly reduced.
Another war point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the will of the military soldier, the test of the Protection House will not be presented to the Parliament, but to a national Defence Council.
In the same way, there is no prohibition of civil procedures in military judges as the units required to protect human rights.
The last also shares their fears in relation to the text that they look for freedom.
The actual structure of Blasphemie will be raised up, and the facilities are now prohibited, which may have severe consequences for the right to free opinion, especially for the prices.
In addition, there are no more articles about the protection of women, understreamed Hea Morayef from Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point of view is the prohibition of the followers by Article 36.
This word was not contained in the previous statement.
While the Egyptian President had to be out of the TV last night, demonstrations are planned for today afternoon.
The officers of the State Office will be married on the sabbath day.
In Israel, Ukraine tourists expected holy cities, the Nabel of the world and a sea from the sun
The Green Land is joined in the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and unreproduct nature.
AIF calls you the five major reasons for a visit in Israel.
More Before the Holy Citys

It means that all those who built in this river receive God’s blessings.
Galilaea is the place where Jesus had accomplished his wonders: the turning of water into wine on a branch, the way on the water, the silence of the seaturm and the fish.
Jesus also appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.

The faiths are here in the way of suffering or the way of the cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The way begins at the Roman Festion of Antonia, Pretorium, where the judgment was, and leads through the streets of the Old city to the grave scroll on the mountain Golgotha, where the cross station, the Salvingstone, and the Grave of Jesus.
Here is the Christian view of the Nabel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The clock of the holy cross in Jerusalem is on the place where a Christian leader grows after the tree, from which the cross was made for the cross of Jesus.
In Jerusalem also the sanctuary place of the Jews - the tent wall, the rest of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E., was destroyed.
Traditionally, there are people in various religious offices with desires that will then be fulfilled.
Take a travel in the height
The runes of the festival of Massada make the rest of the secret abstract before the enemies that Herod of the greatest in 25 C.E. was built for his family.
They are on a steel town in the mountains in 450 meters height above the sea speed.

Everyone else brings a aircraft to this historical gipfel.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters height, the pretty skin area Hermon, in which it is increasing tourists in the wintermonates.
From the feet of the mountain you get there with a shuttle bus.
The skips have a total length of 45 kilometers.
A old league followed the Genelec gods on the mountain.
Visit only Museos
There are about 300 museums in this country.
Only one road can't be watched all of it.
However, at least the five interested ones should be visited.
Once the Israeli museum is outside the Knesset (Parlament).
There are maintained old chemran hands or writes from the Dead Sea, found in the rocks in the wilderness of the Jewish, and about 500 thousand archeological and anthropological Expounds.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also a visit.

In Akko, you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which maintains several old tourists with sculptures of the daily visitors and badeders.
In Caesarea, you should visit the only private Ralli Museum where you can wonder Dali and Rodin sculptures.
There are no museum leaders, nor modern people.

The fifth museum, including the Holocaust-museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, is mentioned by one of the most famous chapters of the history.
The most obvious division is the idea of children that were built to think of the 1,5 million children destroyed in the concentration boards and gascars.
In the entrance of the room, the entire darkness dominates.
Stars work.
And the names of the children of the Jews and the countries in which they die.
The Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three major areas of Israel are on the grounds of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are switching, water parks, Delfinarians and oceanarians.
Increasingly, in the Red Sea, it is also in the wintermonates, because the water temperature does not fall under 21 °C and the air rises to 23 °C.
The Death Sea is even worse, and there will be raised over the whole year.
Eventually, this unlikely sea is with a position of 417 meters under the sea speed the deepest sea of the world.
His Turkish Blue Water has a high salt container, so it takes even non-smoking in the surface.
The environmental landscape is indescriptively beautiful.
The visitors are here for treatment in the use of Salzwater (including Salzsol) and Health Slamm and the treatment of heats, allergies, asthma, exemplary, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and strapatic nerves.
Consider the secrets of the age
These secrets include the Old City of Tel Aviv, and the city of Jaffa in the Mediterranean City.
Through this city, the beautiful sea route, the Egyptians, Syrians, Anatolyses and Mesopotamies were connected together.
The city is mentioned in Alto Greek and Athagyptical Legends.
Translations followed Noah just built his ark here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he led a long and happy life to this place.

The money in the road is better to take in no euros, but in dollars that can be just changed in the skeel (actual change course: $1 to $3,8. schekel).
In the city you are going to go forward with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a fast street, and in Haifa the only U-Bahn line of the country with six stations that are connected to the suburbs.
Exactly, it's a under-in-line front.
A travel inside the city costs independently from the transport shipment 6 schekels, which is sufficiently included for a vehicle from 1,5 hours.

"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for languages
During the delegations and citizens debatting the uses of the law on migrants, crimes are already committed with failure certificates.
Years come 13 million guest workers to Moscow, Sant Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are the citizens of Central: Usbekistan, Tadschikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to pay money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the house.
On 1 December, a law has been enforced by each employer’s migrant to test the knowledge of the Russian language.
This Regulation is therefore applied only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the community residence and in the individual trade.
However, the tests with the time of Federal Migration Authority should be in future for all gast workers.
This is not only the speaker, but also tests in the Russian history and the principles of law.
The language recognition must be indicated as well for the maintenance and the extension of the employment.
Excepts are applicable only for citizens of countries in which Russian Office is.
Furthermore, those who have received their training products and diplomates before the accident of the UDSSR in 1991.
Single, problem and protection of the rights
The total of the tests are under the Egide of the Puschkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of the Popular Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburger State University and other Russian High Schools.
The migrants can carry out tests in all cities; they have already already been opened in Russia more than 160 corresponding centres.
The initiative for the implementation of the tests was supported by the Secretary-General of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
The citizens have made a number of questions before the entry into force of the legislation in the pressure: What does the entire entirely bring?
What amendments brings the provision for language knowledge, as well as for Russians, as well as for the guest workers?
In particular, the migration Authority's migration speaker is to reduce the number of weak workers.
"More talks about the protection of the rights of migrants," says the leader of the representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tadschikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must already be protected before their abbreviation.
Only a organizated recretation will be resolved to 90% of the problems of external workers.
On problems migrants stand without employment, education, language knowledge, and serious advantages.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language knowledge will be fulfilled with evil visions that put him under the front of help in a dark, energy barakke, where he will be built with the same months without food and documents and will be created on 12 to 14 hours day.
We have a lot of troubles from our migrants.
"In the house, you will be promised, and at the arrival you will be attached, you will receive their payments and don't receive the promised reward," confirms the head of the main management of the work migration of the Tadsic migration authorities, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't shoot, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Republics, who want their money in Russia, do not only rule the languages of the target country, but also in their own languages.
Of course, it isn't very much their sin, as much more the evil: only few turkmen, usbeeks and tads can also be able to achieve a reasonable education.
For in their families there is no money once to prevent the children, except to buy them comprehensive clothes, shoes and school cases.
As teenagers, these children also receive the first opportunity for money values.
"It's hard without language knowledge," says they.
"You feel low and low."
The citizens claim the following important aspects of the law.
The test is only to migrate with legal status.
If you don't have this status, there is no check and then no official work.
However, the majority of the guest workers continues to be illegal in Russia.
"Comfortable welcome" or "prohibed future for unbecoming forces"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get a official status in Russia.
The reason is burocratical assaults and, of course, the speaking difficulties.
Furthermore, the legislation costs: 12 to 16 thousand Rubel.
A fashioned registration can be done quickly and just for a half thousand.
The employers of the Russian police know that our documents are failure and we are not registered, and then there are cases of expression.
"You want one or two hundred Rubel for Zigaretten and Tee," says the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Don't smile the costs of false papers"
In the preparation of the day when the law was in force, it appeared that the registration documents of the migrants could not only be failed.
Certain flashed certificates that demonstrate the solution of the speaker have already been adopted by the Federal Migration Authority.
The flashed papers were printed with a normal colour printer.
Of course, the new inhabitants received these: Each migrant, who hoped that the tests could be able, paid for the document seven thousand Rubel.
This is more than double as the costs of the official test: This costs a worker migrant three thousand rules.
In order to protect the system against corruption, the most essential task is to be solved to be solved, both officers and citizens are only one.
For the moment, guest workers who are first falling through the test can only be promised that they get time for a language basis.
Furthermore, new meetings without language knowledge are offered in areas where no active understanding is necessary with people.
Inside Ministry ignored illegal weapons market
A number of legal weapons in crimes exceedingly small
The Russian Inner Ministry plans a broadcast of the weapons services for private weapons.
The authorities react to the most recent events: last in shopping at hospitals and seven deaths in the moscow of the jurists Dmitri Winogradow.
The police wants to forbid the tragedy of non-early weapons in public and the age for the possession of shooting weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the President of the Duma Committee for Security and Corruption War, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments on the weapons care should be submitted in the core of the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "association of the screams".
In the Internet, a open letter was published by the representative - representatives of various weapons - requested by the authorities to take the distance of "insensitive destructions".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very small, exceeding the criminal, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian Service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Internal Ministry, 142 crimes were relied by the use of the registrated weapons in the period of six months in 2012, while all of the same period were signed 1.168 thousand delicts.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the law for private weapons criminals will not be held to serve on the black market.
Today, you can find every possible weapons for little money in Moscow.
However, the inner Ministry indicates that the expansion of illegal weapons is under control.
Providers: from the manufacturers to the official
The weapons have over several channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, tells a former Viktor Baranez, who was ten years in the Ministry and in the General Tab.
Screenshot of a web page accepting weapons
The first channel is the army or the military army, such as weapons who were struck during the battle in Kaukasus.
"The weapons were struck by the Russian officials and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel there are illegal weapons that are locked by criminals.
Baranez explains that weapons were locked directly from the police officers and directly by co-operators of the criminal persecution authorities.
Further illegal weapons are from military weapons.
In many military campaigns, it often came to explosions.
"It is evidence that in some cases it has been done to explore the missing of weapons," says the ancient military officer.
A contribution to the Black Market, in accordance with Baranez, also the weapons manufacturers.
"Today there are increasing privacy fabrics that do not hold the international competition and therefore the weapons under the hand on the black market, even in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggle.
Especially many pistols and fires come from poor countries such as Kirgisian.
"The place is a own, sometimes manufacturer production and a mafia that organizes the smuggel," explains the old military officer.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated the part of each of the five channels in the delivery of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was reported from the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Management.
Experts analysed reports of the Internal Ministry and the Federal Service for State statistics, criminal literature and public accessible data on weapons.
The above part of the illegal weapons shall be raised by the army and the law protection authorities.
The half of all weapons on the black market are there by the "Show of responsibilities that have been able to do in their work with weapons," says the report.
The data of the researchers are followed by 17% of the weapons in conflict areas, 14% returns to the weapons of weapons, and 5% from illegal explosions.
A vendor of a weapons carrier who doesn't want to be named naturally, ensures that weapons that are found in illegal exchanges have no longer buying any more because they are almost older.
Following him, it is most often that the handlers take care of the ship in a weapon.
A weapon is buying a weapon, for example, a piece of TT type, is buyed.
The weapons are issued and delivered by the weapon.
"The handler brings the weapons to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says
"The police, of course, knows about everything, and thus brings it to, if it is not possible to maintain the plan to detect crimes, periodical control solds by manufacturers to offer illegal weapons," adds the vendor.
"Who is in Luxus loading?"
Buyers and vendors are most often found about the knowledge of each other.
I had seen web pages and blogs when someone was watched at me and suggested to come to the "Begowaja" station where a person would expect me to take me to a certain place where we could handle the price.

"To care for a weapons, I need a knowledge that has contacts," says the soldier. "I have so known, but I don't trust him."
There are handlers on the markets, but you have to go there and deal with a code like "Ivan Ivanovitsch, who's justified that the daughter has lost a den."
I'm even in the present, even at some trackings about a knowledge that I trust.
He gives me the shoes also only because he knows that I don't promise him.
See newshops for weapons in various ways.
The ancient military Victor Baranez tried in the middle of the 1990s as an illegal weapons when he wrote a article to this subject.
The schemes have not changed after him.
He received a photo album in the "all possible" image.
"I felt like in Luxus Load," remembers the military partner.
The buyer doesn't get the cat in the sack, but can try everything.
I'm not just buying a potential customer, but walking with the soldier in the forest, and there we set a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I'm sure that the weapons have a good shot, we'll talk to each other," the expert describes the action.
Buying from Sofa
Internet search machines show web sites and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers will be required or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the corresponding money," says it on the web site "buy battle pistols or weapons."
The user gives your settings and asks requests.
Would you also sell at the less years?
"Obviously without licence," asked the user "Iwan" (oral citate).
"Buy a T.T. Moskau," says the laconic question of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service has cut off shortly unreasoned web sites, and buyers who want to buy weapons are accessible to the service in the network.
People come as hungry fish at foot and lands then in Sibia and can shoot colds
Military commenter and ancient military officer Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered in the foreign, and Russian laws are not found in use.
The responsibility shall apply the provisions.
The buyer reveals the money on a bank car.
"All answer, he receives a photo and a description of the hidden weapons," reports the pressor speaker of the common organization "Pravo to oryzhie" Dmitri Kislow.
Viktor Baranez indicates that you can go empty to the end and come back to the streets when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service has cut off shortly unreasoned web sites, and buyers who want to buy weapons are accessible to the service in the network.
"The people come as hungry fish at the football and countries, then, in the cyrical workshops and can look at coals," he says.
A macarow for 100 US dollars
In the purchase of illegal shopping weapons, experts are to calculate prices from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislow from the "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a pistol from the type Makarow for $100 to 300.
You have to wait for a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons of guards middle range.
According to the official statistics of the Internal Ministry, the number of delicts with illegal weapons in the entire Russian period of January to October 2011 returned 7% to 22,9 thousand, while the number of discovered cases of debstail and pressure in relation to weapons, munition, springs and exploitations of 7,8%.
Fist Food and Supermarkt employees in the United States
Every fourth American youths sit anywhere behind the box of Mc Donald's
In the past days, it came to massive protests in the U.S. in the United States to lowly protests in Wallmart and Restaurants loved Fast Food Kettens such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chickens.
No one still can advertise whether the protests will still be attacked or if the air has already gone out soon.
The protests are supported by companies and many common organizations left-oriented organizations.
Besides the increase of specific designs of simple Walmart and Fast-Food employees, the protest organizators persecute the objective to achieve businesses.
The economy's branch has been increasingly organized.
46 cents in the year?
The protesters started the past week after thanksgiving, at the same named Black Friday, where they found in the U.S. soldiers, the millions of customers were locked, and they were led to handmaid.
In this day, some Walmart Middlemans, from which there are 2,2 million worldwide, their work was low and driving together with businesses and the left activists of the cate, whose target groups are low and middle income.
Walmart sells all products, from windeln over jagdwehre and car bathrooms until eggs, and milk.
The products in the Walmart-Filials are in the front of 8 to 27% more beneficial than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the small payable Walmart employees sold on their own workplace.
The prices and the equipment made Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
The criteria follows Walmart may often sold the product so useful because the workers are paying bad.
Finally, there are also difficult work conditions, for example, missing gass or manual scanners.
The participants of the protests in the "Black Friday" requested amounts and outside their worsts about that the contribution to the professional health security was increased from 30 to 100 dollars in the month.
A typical Walmart employer who rewards 9,5 US dollars for the hour, couldn't pay this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley say that if the company increases the average rate of 12 dollars, it would cost Walmart 3,2 billion dollars.
These are about 1,1% more than they're sending for a lot now.
While Walmart was fully replaced to the customers, each investment costed them in the future only 46 cents more.
This would be for them in comparison to more expenditures of only $12,39 for year.
Walmart's officers are satisfied that it came to protest only in nine contracts, and they did not protect any losses to the company.
The Black Friday was carried out in its loads of 8 hours evening to the Sunday evening the next day, and Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second in this period.
The Walmart Cases were totally carried out at "Black Friday" about 100 million transactions.
The speaker of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the link site of Huffington Post, that the total "minder than five" Walmart employees denied the work and only the protestation of a "a PR-Trick" of the company that the protest was organized.
"Free Kasse!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart-Filials (which in this progressive city was not desired, and therefore there were no existence), but McDonald's and other pregnant restaurants.
McDonald says that the company sells billions of parts, and yet you don't give you hospitals, and you won't pay for your honourable work!
Jumayae Williams, member of the New Yorker City Council
Currently, the minimum rate in accordance with federal and New Yorker law is at $7,25 for the hour.
In Fast-Food Restaurants, the minimum rate will be moved, however, not too strong, and in the middle of its simple workers in New York 8,90 US dollars will receive the hour.
Better than she rewards no one in this pure city.
As it is possible to get out with so little money in New York, I'm unbelievable.
There was a time in which almost a fourth of all American young men after the school at McDonald's teach, however, the young people still lived with their parents.
Almost one saw the main entry source or planted to stay there longer.
Now, I agree with interviews with McDonald's co-operators, who are always surprising that they get out of this price and sometimes even need to grow up their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum, which notes that it is unreasonable to get children if you don't know how to reduce them.
Participants of the protests, which started on Sunday at 6:30 tomorrow morning before McDonald's in the 40th Street and in Madison Avenue, asked that the chassiers and cooks of Fast Food Restaurants received a minimum time of 15 US dollars, which is more than a double of this minimum.
They continued to train businesses in the Fast Food Branche.
The U.S. legislation proposes the implementation of the undertakings to stand in the way and to deny or reject or reject business members.
On the other hand, the companies do not make it easy to them.
However, the foundation of businesses in the Fast-Food Bank is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the highest personal flow.
Uncomforted
Soudstarke Proteste has also been in this day for many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The height point of the protest was a congregation in the middle day before McDonald's at the Times Square, where some local democracies spoke, under the city Council member Yumane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says that it is sold billion portions, and you will not pay for your honourable work."
The Demonstrants were also supported by other prominent New Yorker Democratics, for example, the citizenship candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "We should join the Fast Food Middle workers to get a right reward and to reach the economic happiness of each New Yorker."
According to New York Times, this was the greatest action of their type in the history of the American Fast Food Industrie.
However, only some hundreds of people were employed by Weitem not all in the Fast Food Bank, where they work in New York ten thousands of thousands.
It is not yet to be considered if the branch of this protest will be mobilised all measures.
"The cerebral can be overlisted just weakly."
The subject of the extensive reality of modern technology is usually raised by the lens of a special light in the last time.
Google first presented in the room in his year conference a model functioning, then in November, it was known that Microsoft has also announced a corresponding patient.
In conversation with the leader of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft Labor in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the brills for the scientists of the company were only a transition station.
She restricts the opportunity to manipulate virtual objects in the air with only hands and create virtual free spaces.
- Please describe quickly what researchs are concerned with your group.
- We're working with the interaction of human and machines, but we want to increase the limits of this interaction.
Before, the humanity remains the largest parts in the phase, in which pixels are worked on flash screens, which sometimes are also beamed.
However, we want to preview 5-10 years and preview the radically changes of this interaction.
For example, Xbox console and Kinect Sensors are a progress, and today no Xbox will be sold without kinect, because everyone interests for the movement management.
- What are we waiting for in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many are still played on the flash screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system has received more data) could be improved that the output has not been determined before.
We are trying to change it, work on real three-dimensional design systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We need to leave the computer world in our physical world and make them more fascinating.
However, it is necessary that not only the users, but also its environment will be recognised.
Then we could find the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And at first, we should lose these detailed virtual reality helms!
- What do you think of language management?
She's loved, but wouldn't she be valuable?
- She's not sure that it's the solution of the privacy, because you don't always want to inform all the circumstances of its actions and views.
In fact, every kind of interaction with computers is good, however, everyone in its specific nicks.
For example, we worked in the field of control of objects on public places at a project that we have been experimented with a short and Button, instead of loading costs.
It was not recorded by the object camera, but by a armband, which recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It still is relatively big, but theoretical may be reduced to the size of a armband.
However, the future, however, is misled types of control, such as gestic and language.
- How's that?
- Will we ask me for instance to riche you these sudden doses?
They say it and describe it in the same time.
- Normally, I just just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Do you mean, you want to apply the user to what a machine can handle at the same time and what doesn't it?
- Not unconditional, but it's about a contrast approach.
I think we must work in the next time, especially in the development of new sensor types, which are able to achieve exactly reactions of persons.
This can, for example, be Laserensors, because they offer a good solution in the depth, which is very important.
- What questions do you make out of your work with the Xbox Kinect Sensors at modern cameras?
Is it hard to resolve, depth or something else?
- The present generation is based on a good outgoing point for our work in the area of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 Megapixels would not be bad with a speed of 1000 fps.
However, the main facts are not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
All the current technologies are not good enough for us because the developers of the algorithms have more work.
Not only the solution should be considered at the X and Y, but also at the Z axis.
The speed and the number of images per second are also important.
The movements of humans are extremely dynamic and open said, the present 30 fps are particularly less for passengers.
Stephen Betishes developed in our Labor in Redmond with a regular processing interruption between 1 to 100 milliseconds, where the current commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction of human and machines.
For my work, I just needed a proposal, only without the management and with more images per second.
- Doesn't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect currently works with three "Cammeras", where one of them is actually an infrarot sender and the second is a recipient for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a normal RGB camera.
She does not serve to calculate the objective.
More cameras may be able to resolve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem because more calculations would be necessary.
Nice would be a flexible, Kinect-like system, which we could play with various camera-relateds to determine how it helps us in the three-dimensional tridimensional motion of a position.
- If I remember right, the Microsoft presented in the respect of Google his brills not the publicity.
Do you not think that, in view of the use of the technology of the extensive reality in the whole day, the brills have the best views?
- Of course, it's not a pleasant to keep a smartphone in the higher hand, but I think it's the following: the most recent variable would be a "changed" reality when we could turn over a cloud from the bride to the smartphone,
The brill is a personal gadget and there is its strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, because a wide reality has been able to work together with others on virtual objects.
- Let's see a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal death.
There is a problem to show the criteria of this idea often: There is no feeling reaction!
The hands feel nothing!
What answers will your group give to this input?
- In my explanations, I often say that the extensive reality shows the seventh break in the interaction between human and machines.
I think that the eighteen breaking could be the integration of the tactic approval.
An interesting method is now the use of the second hand as something increasing projection fund.
She's pretty pretty surprised!
However, there are also technologys that are actually equipped to provide the "images in the air", for example, the interference of some guided aircrafts in a certain point where the finger is, a feeling that is currently hard, but still so hard, as a man who has broken on the handballs.
There are also branches for the handheld that affect the nervous ends in the fingers, also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to overlist the brain?
Does it think that it feels what it should feel if it's just looking something?
- That's a good idea, so we didn't try it yet.
Here is another job that we have to fight longer, a person who is physically in a closed room believes that he is in an open, practically infinite space; here we work in concepts with shipping countrys (other than in Fitness Studios), move platforms and large balls.
Before, the brain can only be overlisted, and before us there's a lot of work years.
In addition, this makes the work in the area of virtual reality for a researcher: in many subjects, we are only at the beginning.
Custom shack in place of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde" which has been avoided by the citizens who make the Avantgarde of art and culture.
On the reading list, there have already been landing high representatives of Petersburg artists, whose success over the borders of the city and find the recognition often in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new held of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known by Kirill Miller, who is clothed in Rot, which you're in the Russian Museum, once in the sommer garden, sometimes at the scene travels or on prophecy.
Where the images of Kirill Miller are also issued, they have a great human mass.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburger social philosophy artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a light person of Petersburger Avantgarde end of the 80er or the beginning of the 90er.
He is also a man of the city, and he suffers by his presence on the streets of his citizens a dream in his face and cares with them for good lust.
Before the short, he shocked a Drehorgel and became a Petersburger Drehorgel player, since he felt for this difficult role in view of his artist, his philosophy and his image finally ready.
- Kirill, why are you always in Red and not in gold or Turkish in the city?
I chose the red color as a modedesigner, which seems along with the optic and the image.
In this world there is the Red of the compromise between artists, imageberates and society.
In the society, it calls all things from the gravity normal, aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to come to talk with people through my provocations.
Each of my past proposals was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you need to be a bitch?
- In an explanation in the culturepalast Newskij, where my works were made.
I'm sure I have to go this way.
Then the time of old was free, but not officially recognized times at the end, and new and free times as I was unbelievable.
I enjoyed the models of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "gazonwschina", that was "Puschkinskaya 10", and then it was only one time.
I'm going to the theatre, mode, music, actually, except literature.
I was important to stand in the middle point of Petersburg's culture where the best creating artists should be gathered.
In 1995, I set a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a musical artistic club for the boheme, the house of Petersburger Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Snur and his friends sing simple songs to playback, traveling trikots and belonging to them also to the Igor Wdowin Componist today.
When the group started playing alive, it was from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them trachtenberg, and it began his great carriers, but he learned the principles with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have their origin in the kind clinic.
There's been our partners and staff guests.
I'm a hero of the past century, as the culture means something.
In 2000, there was a question in the press, in which it went to the sign of "the persons of our city".
I won in the category "Articles of the Year", and so I was at the high point.
It is not easy to work in new times after old rules; I am a man of truth, truth, and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to be blessed, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be happy without contributing to a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unknown style.
- Many of my pictures are real perles and clearly bring the actuality and the shadows of the thoughts to express.
I'll have an explanation with the "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are in time.
Before I was social, but now I worried it and prepared to be so.
In a clown, it's all over and loss his tragedy.
I love the Great, and I have great ideas.
For example, let's say the world, we suggest that everyone has to be completely covered.
Now, everybody looks on the clothes and orientates himself outside and not in the inside of the human.
But maybe you can't give a man the hand, but should be smoking in his face.
The shadow is disappeared by the shadow.
- We've seen you in the role of the city's Drehorgel Games.
Who if I don't?
- Can the commercial art also be good?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, faced and weird.
We're seeing the illness of the cultures.
In the past, the people made great groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people others.
Now there are microcommunications, and it is difficult for all.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that likes everybody.
Now you need to imagine who you'll like.
Now every Kultstar has about 100 annexes.
- To the resorts of Stas Michailow, but there are thousands!
- Women left to him, there's a role of sexual social sphere.
Because of cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, there are less management, money, and everything is based on.
I have an advocate, and it is the most important to do it and to destroy it.
In my youth, I've drawn such pictures that are even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I'm starting with images that usually come just at the end of the carriers.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumption are grown.
The consumption has no culture, that's something else.
I am a man of the past culture and grows up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and money to make it possible.
That's the culture I'm surprising.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good culturexperten.
They say, "Culture's servants."
However, no one of them can be considered with culture.
It was different in the real seasons, because the shirts may not understand much of culture, but they understood that the right experts are needed.
In Moscow there are now good advice.
In Petersburg, we have those who could be experts, but they will be locked by the way, because it needs higher experts that assess the first ones right and free their way.
Now, it's just the own smoke.
The same applies to Erarta, however, with the difference that they say honestly that they don't all accept time genetic arts and sometimes have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the culture capital town; in Moscow there are many more cultures and a suitable grounds.
On our stones art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural neighborhood, for example, we have more writers than reader, and this is not right.
In Europe there are many new people who visit explanations or concerts.
That's much less with us.
The art must be again modern, as to the beginning of the past century.
The project is financed from the town of Sant Petersburg
Birth in the World
Earth in danger.
Territory or cohesion with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of room ships with ground residents in the boat are looking for a replace planet.
In order to save humanity, is the important question of how we can continue in gravity or on the replacement planet?
Many choices are not in my opinion.
The fact there are only two real planets that we can at least live hypothetic.
"Nomen Mars and Venus," says the scientist cooperator of the Astronomic Starberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparedly living, a temperature of 500 degrees rules on the surface of the Venus.
Life would only be in great height or in the circuit area of Venus, so in all possible.
The question of the proceedings in all the researchers first treated in respect of Flora.
For a half-year century before experiments were conducted with plants.
The fourth generation of the inherited in Orbit was not different in the less than the earthly species.
It followed the smoking of insects, exactly of wine fruit flows (drosophyla), in orbit.
In 1979, the Watch Towers were sent to the universe to investigate how the gravity has affected the development of Embryos.
It's developing a total normal kitchen.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the kitchen has to be found; it must stand on his legs and begin to move," explains the labour leader of the Institute for Medical Biology Problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without a fixed base, the kitchens are slowly overwhelmed.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the new births were completely disappeared.
The kids did not react to light and volume.
Four days later, they died so easy.
"Wladimir Sichew has set a successful experience with the kitchens in all.
The last broadcast with animals fled 16 years ago in the Orbite.
In March 2013, the experiences will continue.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" is only similar species.
There was an experiment with rats already visited to all.
Principally, nothing special has been defined.
"This was just with the Biosatellis, but again it was just a single experience, and the research must continue," Wladimir Sichew noted.
After the landing, the worldwide room rates were achieved.
The problems of promotion could not be solved directly in the world room.
The job is hard.
Animals that are declined from their natural lifespace can only follow their planning operation.
Instead of animals, humans may be the principle.
Homo sapiens is too abstractly capable of thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
These experiences are not implemented from ethical provisions.
But women are already flying for 50 years in all.
The biggest risk was in Tereshkowa.
The most valuable humanity is the fair organism.
Our Mowe fled from it, and no one on earth could answer the following question: Does she understand the worldwide airport?
Can they bring a child to the world after this flight?
"In fact, no one answered this question," says the roomship veterinary Watchandse.
In June 1964, only one year after its worldwide aircraft, the first rabbit cosmonautin, Valentina Tereschkowa, was a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in All, Swetlanda Sawizkaja, who was two times in Orbit and even works outside the room vehicle, was a son.
However, a risk remains.
We have only been a few cosmonates, with which long flights all went well and they have been healthy.
"It's more dangerous, it's very dangerous in the flights in the Orbit," concluded Cosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, the held of the Sowjetunion and the held of the Russian Federation.
And however, humanity has to look for new ways in biotechnology, strategy protection and products of artistic gravitation.
Hydrolabor in the preparation center of the cosmonates is a obligatory station during the preparation of the airport.
In a switch state, the cosmonate routine wins for the work in the open world.
The water makes the gravity.
Even if adult waters are accepted, it is a foreign environment, but smokings receive water as natural element.
It's like the small yotynders would testify that the life in the country has gone to the ocean.
There is a relationship between the fact that a child has about 9 months in the tree of the mother in the fruitwater, and that it can be easier for water.
In principle, it's logical because it's from born to the first wedding just two weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says Babyswimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While a new-born child is a lot of natural state, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of gravity, the smoking muscle is very quickly returned, and it also takes the ability to express the child.
All right, let's get it through a bunch of help.
For example, the birth could also be located in a special room to express the child.
"But what happens then?" says the unexpected question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial weight.
Without feeling of education, the organism can't imagine the skelet and the muscles.
A newborn child can't be raised as a adult to training in a laptop.
He will just miss what is for his life of elementary significance.
"This experience that we take together, including the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to a defense, to bring a completely unappropriate people into the world," says the leader of the Bioetiko Mission of the Institute for Medical Biology Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
Before the birth of children in the universe is only theory.
But sometimes, it will be reality when the earthquakes in their room ships to a remote planet that will be the house for their born generations.
NKU Chef: Control of the Black System has been delivered by the excuses of the policy
The Czech Research provides public commitments on good control institutions and adjusted laws, however, in their use.
In the conversation for currently. what says dies of the Vice-President of the Highest Control Agency (NKU), Miloslav Kala.
"A law has never been fulfilled, but it must be applied correctly - and this is my thought not the case," says Kala the current situation.
A similar result appears also to be a common control through the Czech and German tests.
As a negative practice example, he leads to the introduction of the Prime Minister Peter Netem to along. "Carto System".
Unfortunately, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not apply the officers to control - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, the Government President can not just come, and the control officer that now is the control of the legislation, in its activities," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Advisory Chambers, you have spoken about a common Czech German project, in which the laws of both countries were compared with each other.
What was that exactly?
It is a parallel test that we have started for a few years ago.
Simply says that the European legislation determines how public commitments are to handle, and then the national laws are established, and there is still the real practice.
This is all that we have matched, and although the test is still not completed, we could definite extremely interesting differences, and generally says that the laws are even more "creasing and perfecter", but the real application is better in Germany in some parameters.
To ensure that it is not enough to reinforce new and more precise rules, and it is also necessary to consider the right’s own application.
How can the project be a help? What happens to you from this project?
In addition, such a common control could help us to stop a perfection of the laws and the increasing and equipment of smoke values if this is not particularly positive.
Economicity means to receiving a matter of a comprehensive price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude unjustly range or criminal actions.
However, the reduction of weight values for tasks does not guarantee that we also get this goal.
Perhaps it's even so that we can load the system on this way only with a super-specific "papier cram", and those who look for the bugs in the system it's more easier to use the system than if the smooth values remain higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Republic.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority like our NKU, or does the system work differently?
What the authorities concerned is the German Pendent for the NKU of the Account Office, which is likely built with us, and also on a college, which is only a thing different. However, both authorities work in the same way.
The competents also are comparable to a certain way, however Germany is an agreement, including that these accounts are also in the Member States, in which the German system is different from our.
The BRH can only control the contracts, which correspond to our state measures.
The public measures that are administrated with us by the assemblies and communities are under control of the country accounts.
What is the German legislation, is the easier than ours?
In general, I would just compare this without specific information, but it would not be more useful for Germany in some consideration, but it would not be possible to say that Germany is better.
Maybe that's what the tests are better there?
That's not, but as he said, I don't like such comparisons.
It is still noted that the countries who are a model for us also have to fight with problems.
In other cases, they had nothing of a cooperation with our authority, right?
What does the Czech legislation, which significance for your authority had the novelling of the delivery, you already feel any effects?
In view of that this Novelle is just a short time in force, it doesn't affect our tests yet.
Since our controls are at least found, we need to calculate here with a certain delay.
The effects that we have seen in the future preparation of controls - so we have introduced the new control tool "Detection of the risks of non-economy" and tested and analysed with this approximately 14,000 public tasks - here the changes will be clearly affected because the values of smoking have changed the conditions for certain types of expressions.
Do you see the provision of this law more positive, or will the system be loaded with another bureaucracy?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and hope that this approval is confirmed.
However, it may be the problem that the rules will be "speaking" and not be able to be maintained.
For the preliminary rules, the persons undertaken against the traveller (e.g., in the case of an operational programme of the regional policy, the regional Council) are intended to assume that each non-containment of the budgetary discipline is equal to the loss of the budget.
But is it easy to make the law more stricter?
I don't think of this way.
The system must exclude those who want to call and use the system, not those who have done a form error that does not affect the real decision finding.
This system only makes the bureaucracy under further greater pressure.
Where's the way here?
Let's first say what way is not targetable.
The Prime Minister said unfortunately that the ODS didn't control the officers with the control of the soccer. "Carl System" - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
However, a law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, it can not just come to the Government President, and the control of which it is now the control of the legislation in its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter," but he can't say that we do this as if nothing.
The delivery contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain procedures, and it is also right for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the beer is excluded with the best offer only because of form mistakes.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is what I miss with us.
On the streets, the ice flows are unanimous, however, they are smoking.
On the streets of the Czech Republic, there are part of the snow and ice flows.
However, the streets are goodly achieved, and underwards are offered high attention.
Karlsbad
In Carlsbad, the streets were well experienced today's morning, uniformed the rainful snow and ice floor.
The temperatures are swallowed to -5 to -10 °C, and it must be something weighter.
In the region there is no longer snow, and there is only a dark snow ball in the deep heights.
However, at the camps of the aircraft, about 30 cm snow.
According to the information of the front-shirt guards, a restricted view of the nebels.
The fast travel R6 and the travelways of the first street class in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, attention is, for example, recommended to bridges which are required by the vehicles under and fat.
All transport paths of the second and third street class, including the mountain streets.
However, on these streets, the snowest of the snow or the snow of the separately required.
In particular, in the higher level, there is therefore higher attention.
Bezirke Pardubice and Hradec Krillove
On some streets Eastbohmens, there is dangerous for the ice grounds, in higher positions and in the mountains, in the streets, in the fields, is still a snow snow snow, shares the streets and car carriers direction on their websites.
The travel managers warn the travellers before the iceplate, especially in higher positions in the pardubice Besirk.
To the Eisglatte, especially on the transport of the second and third street class in the Green Lanšcroun, Hosti over Orlicia, Polyčka, Svitavy and High Myto.
The Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly on the streets in the river town and in the mountains of Orlical mountains.
An excessive snow snow snow is in high places on the streets of Richnov's cross over the prince and Trutnov.
In the East Beaches, it is overwhelming or higher today, and it remains widely free.
The temperatures are moved between -3 and +1 °C, it is a weak wind.
Small arrows
The streets in the cyrk pills are today well experienced, however, locally, higher attention is recommended, and the driving way is to adapt to the weather.
This is happy on the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees under the worst point.
Since it was born before, and the temperatures later fell, it can come on the streets to the roads.
It is also to calculate with the nebel, however, the view will be improved in the day loop.
These information are from the Masters of the Security Straits.
The car D5 is practically unrestricted, higher attention recommends, however, the streets masters between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The vehicles of the first street class are overwhelming, however, traveling.
However, in the south of the circles and the tachov, it can be drifted away from the ice flows.
The carriers of the second and third street class are feed, and therefore the indication is applied to the possible sections required.
The vehicles should mainly be careful on the less frequency streets in the area of Böhmerwald.
Olomouc Bezirk
With sneematch, we need to calculate carriers that are in the direction of the high places in Olomouc Besirk.
After the use of travel vehicles, Schneematch remains on the Pass Cervenohorskie selo and on the street in direction Videlski Cross.
Night snippets moved the streets managers to use, in the Circuit Sumperk falled according to the information of the streets management about 3 cm Newsnee.
In the other areas of the Bezirk, the vehicles are most unlimited.
"In the cross Sumperk remains in the heights and the snowest.
At the Pass of Cervenohorskie selo, the drivers must be calculated in direction of Jesennik with Schneematical," said a co-operator of the travel management Sumperk today against the CTK agent.
Even their colleagues in the circuit of Jesenanor had to go out in the night, according to their information, the streets are free and loose to the high places of chemical treatment.
In the Circle Olomouc, the streets are unlimited, but the vehicles have to go carefully in Waldabs because the vehicles are still fair.
Bezirk Remember on Lab, Bezirk Liberec
In the northern boats, the travel managers report several bad traveling sections.
Besides several locations with snow or ice floor, the mountain street of Telnice to Kninice is locked in the Ciris Usti n.K. according to the information of the transport policy.
The temperature remains also in deep levels under zero, so that snow and ice will be maintained on the streets. From the deep levels, especially in the south of the Middle Beam, no problems are reported, and the streets are regularly broken.
There are no traffic disasters reported for a long time.
It is notified in particular from the area of the road.
According to the data of meteorologists, it was in the night ideal conditions - day over rain and snow, in the night without cloud sky and flood.
From the main tracks and from the I/13 road to the border of the Bezirke Usti n.L. and Liberec will be reported bad transport conditions.
The locking of the streets between Telnice and Kninice was required by exemptions that were printed from the sneelast to the carriers.
Simon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think to find in less than a month of the world's entertainment?
It's one of the catestropy reports that we're so grateful to the people.
With our band The Tap Tap Tap, we make more pleasure and say that we are the only band of the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's department.
In December, you also realize a single project with three concerts against the world.
Can you present our readers next to the project?
It's a country-wide beneficis structure that we have planned for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of Maya's calendar, which has been prognosed for 21 December at 11:10 tomorrow.
On the day before, on 20 December, three concerts are located at the same time from 21:00 in Prag, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concert must be at some time at the end of the Pacific Kiribati Island, which is in a time zone for 12 hours before us, the Maya calendar ends.
Who's this idea?
Originally well from me, then we have developed the ideas together with our graphical Honza Augusta.
We want to collect not only enough positive energy to prevent the world's transition, but we also want to think about the public, in what situation we will deliver this world once to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, tails, and key-shinders against the world's coming, with which the people can also support us by buying on www.e-tap.cz.
The Band The Tap Tap Tap also took the soccer Hymne against the world's past with the title "World Overgang falls."
Even today, the hymne on YouTube is very loved. Do you also get it on the beneficial concerts?
Absolutely, and although the end, it suggests that everything falls and the world's past doesn't be found...
The Hymne shall be fulfilled by all interpretes on all three concerts.
Furthermore, the hymnes will be transferred together in a direct movement from the Czech TV.
The text of Hymne is from Thomas Hanak, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the videoclip, also Xindl X sings with...
How have you come to cooperate with both?
We also cooperate with further personalities of the Czech Cultural Scenas, which involves that we realize many benefits and concerts...
We are trying to attach these people intensively to our projects.
It has shown that most of us are interested in a cooperation, and they have enjoyed it.
What is the purpose of the solution of the concerts to benefit against the world's past?
For the establishment of the free education center of the studio where we have been working six years together with the Federal Tap in Jedlička Institute.
Learns of Jedlička Institute are regularly represented by lectors that help them in different free-time activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lectors, we want to help them in this way.
In the framework of the Jedlička Institute, there is a own building in which we enter with this project.
In each concert, several groups and interprets are included.
What criteria have you looked for these?
We wanted to cooperate with a program that all generations were considered in the inclusion of children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Lesbian support, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Search.
Continue to find out on the website www.kpks.cz.
Is similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May, we start on the first time at prayer's birthday, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year, we would like to go to the Chess house in New York, and I personally - if we're already in the United States - it would also like to connect to upstairs in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small until you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group that combines from people with restrictions.
How do you consider these travels logical and organized?
It's not so bad as it appears on the first face.
Five of our members are a role traveler, e.g. the role balls must be promoted in the packaging room, and, of course, we need to cut out many instruments and other...
It has always been struck without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always prepared very well for us that I have sometimes been surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were longer, there was no problem.
By your foreign travels, you have a comparison of the way it seems to be in individual countries with barrier freedom, how you are around there with restricted people, etc.
How did you get these things alive?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities in which everything works better than with us, we were just in Russia witnesses that it is still in the east.
In addition to Prag, Moscow is absolutely unrestricted. There is still in common if someone in the role scroll is only in the city center.
It is not yet self-conscious that it is, for example, a role carrier in the air.
Happyly, there are also the United States who try to reveal the problems of humans with restrictions.
And in what regard do we need to achieve the further developed countries?
There are more things we're going back...
However, it is still noted that the improvement of the situation is always depending on the efforts of the concerns.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely usually that people may be moved in the public room, toilets, etc.
But it isn't usually that there is a larger group inside people active in society, where we are a little forward with the band The Tap Tap to the West!
The respect in public and barrier freedom is a matter, but only when the most important sports, artists, shooters, political or legal officers come from our series, the things will really begin to change.
At least these are only the same cases of special desirable persons.
The Tap Tap is now very popular. But if we return a few years: What has motivated you to get a band in 1998?
I started as a maintainer in Jedlička Institute, where I felt many young people who were interested in doing something intensively.
And as I am a musician and U.A. play Saxofon, I found a music-AG together with a college.
Well, and with that time, it's how our moderator, Laдзіa Angelovič, is to say, it's a pleasant thing outside control (law).
But the band was known only in the last years, or am I wrong?
It is true that cooperation with known songs has helped us, and we also have started to move active for us.
We have been convinced that, if you're able to see something, and it is not to see it outside, it doesn't exist its own loss in some sense.
Thanks to the EU supporters, we can also provide good lectors, high-valuable devices and etc.
Was it your goal to get it so far with the Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I've spent the potential that you can do the things different.
In the showbusiness, you are often copying each other today.
It is logical in his way, because all news are considered with care and are only accepted after a long time.
There's just a few really unique things, and I mean, I mean, Tap Tap Tap hears it.
The first impression that most of the supervisor has is self-comprehensive; it's only...
But this medicine is absolutely superfluous because people with disagreements are no single and lost ways we need to do so.
There are people who live in a perfect life and can develop themselves if they have the need for it.
I always say that if people do something with disagreements, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Is it also helpful for this success that you are a serious chief, how do you hear of many people?
If you want to do something good, you can't enter compromises in many things and also require a certain discipline.
This is my mind, but it's totally normal.
Some come to us with romantic suggestions, and if they determine that they have two times the week tests, they need to solve preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert streets, then the respiration will resolve in many quickly.
But it works all around, in every band that wants seriously working and something to get.
Now the Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were from the beginning since 1998?
Only one: ship Angelovič.
We're a open group, people come and go.
He who has the will and the pleasure of the covenant will be welcome to us.
Find instead of the day before the world's transition, Sunday on 20.12.2012 at 21.00
Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fleda/Brnoem and Plynoem/Ostrava; 12 Chess bands and other music
All three processing orders are connected to the end by Live scale, and it gets a common interpretation of the Hymne "Welcome falls out" of the Band The Tap Tap Tap.
The objective of the concert is to make the means for the establishment of a multi-functional education centre that should be included under the name of STUDEO in Jedlička Institute in Prag. Cost point: 25 million CZK
The income costs 400 CZK, children to 12 years without cost, cards are available in the preventing of Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the world room.
The past week, Poland has been adopted at a ministerial meeting of the Member States of the European World Environment Organization of the ESA as twenty member of this worldwide authority, so that Poland is the second Member State from the earlier East Block (the ESA member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the next years.
The way of Poland in the world's room started freely many years ago.
Even before the Second World War, the Poland Cosmos was employed with the room carrier, where they did not always be understood.
I remember here, for example, the proposal of A. Sternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warschauer Observatorium, in which the author of thinking of his pioneer work "Einging for Cosmonautic".
However, the ideas of the young engineers (e.g. 1905) made the audiences cold, and after years, she remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had only shown interest in his work.
Steernfeld won in 1934 for "Einging for Kosmonautic" the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch signed Price REP-Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later was an important astronomy and space traveller.
In Poland magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldly recognised contribution to the development of the room traveling has been convinced that one of the craters were called on the outcome side of the month after him.
Preparely in 1925, a ice-shirt drasine was built in Poland for a raketen operator.
The author of the design and the details of this proposal remained unknown.
It is not yet clear if the racket should be used to start or break the drain.
The information will be available exclusively from the time Genesis Press.
In 1933, the Poland Infantery began to be considered with racket operators.
The research works led the Institute College Technikki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Miečslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From the transmitted documents, it is considered that the research was proceeded to the stadium of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted freely by the inmarket of Germany.
In 1937, in the Fachpresse of the Roxazian staying design of a photoelectric jagdrakete, and in the next year, the work "Rakieta - Torpeda air trip and rakietombomba lotnicza" appeared in the work of the author Leliwa-Crywoblock.
Both projects were considered the military use of the raketen operator.
Currently before the war, all projects were coordinated for military use of the Rakettenchnik from the transit scientific Advisory Committee (Timczas Committee Doradczo-Naukowski).
The Committee was established in 1937 after two years of action, however, his work was finished from the beginning of war.
Further articles on the room travel were shown after the war, thanks to the work of the Poland Spanish Trade Society (Poland Astronautical Association) in the Poland Press.
The first explanation of this society follows 1954 in the November issue of the magazine, in which four major articles of the room experience are invoked.
The article of Prof. M. Subotvicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a room company.
At that time there were the first projects for satellite technology, and it was to see that the research of the world's future would have.
In the beginning of 1956, the PTA PTA was tried to contribute to the 1951 International Federation for Space Trade, and the PTA has already been a regular member of the PTA.
In the next year, the first PTA president, Kaziheim Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), the representative of the International Federation for Space Trade.
This office was in 1959 until he died.
Since 1956, the PTA participated in the development of the extreme successful meteorological rakete (Rakieta meteorologicna), the first Poland Rakete for Scientific Research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, which first started on 10 October 1958.
The racket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and not totally 5 kg.
Afterward, a improved version of the RM-1A, built, and 1959 started in the Blyds-East Airport tests with the 2-string RM-2.
The racket was 1,4 m long and about about 11,5 kg.
Another development level should be already in the ability to achieve real scientific work - the racket RM-34 should get a airport from 14,5 km and to be used for the monitoring of high winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was established.
Following the first rackets of the RM type, the Meteor-1 racket was developed in 1962 to 1965.
The racket was conceived as two level rackets, their total length was 510 cm and the start growth was 32,5 kg.
Three types were developed from these rackets (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), different from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A racket has available over a transport space with 0,4 litres fascinating, meteor-1B over 0,34 liters and meteor-1C over 0,62 liter.
The maximum airport was achieved at all three types of 37 km.
In 1965 to 1968, the meteor-2-racket was developed in the airport institution, which first airport tests started in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was in place to promote a use of 10 kg in a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions of meteor-2H and meteor-3 were built.
It is also considered that the advantage of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, on the two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Polish participated in the framework of the Interkosmos programme, also in the worldwide research with soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Poland Pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski was the second intercosmonaut after the Cheche Vladimir Remek.
The extent of the law on common works is not a solution.
In the past week, the Court of Justice established the law on common works.
This decision called a living debate in public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problems once from a larger perspective.
The liberal economy systems in the EU and in the globalised world are raised on the principle of the unregularized economic competition.
In the end, this means that individual people's economy are in a permanent conflict.
For this reason, the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of the private capital, which is handmaid with free financial speculation.
Because of the great difference of the value of work (leaven), the price scans.
In this case, it is to understand a state in which the manufacturer tried to be achieved by importing goods in the economic competition by means of "providing the competition" in order to increase a larger market share and to increase its winning.
This means that most of the companies are to be able to achieve their performance in the outside or to build their business, but the result is a high-employment in countries with high-employment costs comparable.
Since the Private Capital does not have society responsibility and it does not have any responsibility for the unemployment of it, the state expenditure is necessary.
This situation is still strengthened that the officers are absolutely irresponsible to pay their assets and thus replace all the caused economic and social diseases.
This situation is generally known so that specific statistics are overflowed in this position.
The unrespective practice of the Private Capital makes a situation in which the governments are intended to travel in competition, in order to facilitate the social level of their own population, and thus put out outside capital into the country.
Other words: Governments provide their own population without respect to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is particularly the laws applicable in amendments.
The objective of these measures is to urge its own population to accept the Dictate of the Private Capitals, in particular in the field of employment.
This happens to one of the economic weakness in long-term unemployment, others by the decrease of the rights of workers.
The results are growing poverty, and always greater difference between arms and kingdom.
In Germany there are a few years ago public food details for poverty that are not able to increase themselves by their own work.
The number of concerns is already in the millions.
During the increase of the competitive capacity of Germany, it is regularly in cases where the employees have a strict reward that the State must reach their income until the minimum of existence.
A such scanal was also discovered in the case of employed officers in Germany.
In practice, all EU countries in the southern countries will be subject to the same state in which people are intended to emigrate their social levels (as it was in the 19th century), or to make hunger on the border of the society, and to hope that some private investment capital would be placed into the country.
This is naturally the question where this capital comes?
If it comes from another EU country, the poverty from a country is only turned into another; or the capital remains totally, since in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Marokko, Egypt, or in Africa, workers of the broad part of the European leon.
This is the whole Latin America.
Liberal theories and media were said to overruss that the State could not participate with capital in its own population economy and that the planet economy leads to economic catastrophe.
The Private Capital maintains stress on its position that the State cannot be linked to the economy.
However, you need to ask whether the Private Capital does not affect the policy and that the whole State affects or affects its own egoistic meaning.
This is the final answer: Yes.
The evidence for this is the existence of practically powerful and in all States.
The result is a deceived situation in the area of corruption, the contradiction, a legislation, practically everything, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a State Ministry does not have private financials, nearly committed legal companies with the manufacture of law designs.
These legislation shall then be agreed on the date of contract.
All violence will then be no longer from the people as western consciences, but from strong financial groups that make their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies were now quickly in a situation, as they appian in his work for the crisis of the Roman Republic in Césars and Pompeius: "The State had been a long time in disaster, and the emergency was attached to violence.
With smile money, by unreasonable expense of provisions or with stone and sword.
The corruption has grown illlessly, and the people went with already buyed votes to choice" ... "Mans with characters are not kept for emergency, so that the State, after this deadly past eight months, had no consultation" ... "Man already started to talk about that the only medicine in this severe situation is a rule, and that a strong man should be chosen"... Appian thought that it was Pompeius, but the strong man was then finally César, which the democracy has been created by all her owners.
As shown, today's society is based as in the antiquity on the preliminary preference of its own property, without care for all society interests.
The Private Captain is no longer able to recognize and continue the provision for the whole society.
The result, today, as soon as soon, is an exampleless decade of the elevens who do not try to reform severely.
Therefore, the reason for the achievement of the fashism and the communism must be searched for the freedom of economic systems in 19 and 20th century.
From today’s state, the degree of this regime may be considered as a certain pause in which the next rounds are already signed.
Especially the katastrophal is the fact that the elite today are the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives, humanitarian and social katastrophes, which we are now witnesses, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and new history, are in perfect ignorance.
There is no solution here, at least no longer.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition, the Chess will be required to continue to search for ways to press the social level of the population below.
This trend is therefore system-conditional.
The only solutions are targeted political social reforms that increase the capital participation of the State to the economic, increase the influence of the citizens to the Government and the monopolation of the private capital in the society.
Israel: Labour of Chaos.
"... that nothing is deceived from violence, or can't be anywhere" sings Sting in the song Fragile, which is the most important verse in the refrain: "... that we don't forget how we are broken."
"If my sons don't want to war, don't be," says the dead Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last weight of violence between Israel and the Gaza stream, there was a number of reactions.
Those who stand behind Israel and argument their right to self-defense, while they are the Palestinians as terrorists; others again support Palestinians, argument with the Rassism of the Israeli State, with which the Palestinian Arabians people killed and called the State of Israel as a terrorist.
I don't want to write to this position who has been able to enter into the current political situation and have not reached the beginning of violence.
I mean, I'm going to open the readers the view behind the collises, looking on who the 95 years of Spanning (received from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small flock country in the nearest east, in particular.
My thoughts are part of accessible historical facts, others are declined from these, and are out of my own understanding, who or whose group of people affects the events of the modern history.
The history of humanity is in the first line a story of the battle around the power.
In every epoch, we can put an Alexander out to the big or a napoleon.
The less probable is the question of whether these persons were always themselves who determined their steps autonom, or if someone stand behind their throne, who leads their deeds to a precious goal.
We need to believe that we live in a time in which the riches of the world are concentrated in the hand of less individuals, and that this concentration of the money and the power that is prevented is not found within a generation.
Under these astronomical rich families, a special appearance that could be called the head of the cracks (I don't know if anyone stands over them, but I didn't shut it out) - the Rothschilds.
Many are not written about them.
Of course.
The First Presse Agency (Reuters) was already buyed by the Roth Schilds in the 90s of the 19th century to link their name with highcriminal actions, in their background the establishment of their power, the increase of their power or both.
The Roth Childs are almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries where they are not participated in the central banks, they take wars or smooth on them (for the accident in Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the overfall of the Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the staff of Ghaddafis remained only four, where Russia has submitted to the Central Bank of Russia during the period of its Russian government).
He who has always tried to decline this family had to pay for life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, started to release the bank notes in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy started to issue its own banknotes and wanted to evacuate the FED - he was killed 1963; the reporter Louis Mc Fadden was 1936 rejected after he wanted to declare the FED for the exclusion of the World Economic Crisis in 1929.
The global powers of the Roth Schilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to form a plan for deceivement of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freeman of 33, and so the highest grade of the knowledge.
The first war had to be struck by the great monarchist states of Europe, especially by the Second War, the Colonel Government of the United Kingdom, and the third war would reduce the world population at about 0.5 - 1 billion people (the number of such would be concerned for their approvals and the Luxus), a universal religion (the ecumenis is not yet more than the field) and would be able to reach absolute powers.
The method with which the group of rich families work with the Roth Schilds at the pitze is the solution of a crisis and the following offer of a solution (order from chao - order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and are always leading to disappoint the situation (see FED's Grund, so that the crisis like those of them in 1907 do not repeat again).
After the murder of the Habsburger Thronled Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Zerenreich through the revolution of the Bolschewiches.
The First World War ended with the unresolved, military and economic capital of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Serena was no longer required), and then the solution of the Middle-European Majority of Austria has succeeded.
In order to facilitate the second World War, the banks have made a lack of conflict situation through the political policy through which they have made Germany with gigant-reparations; thus they have established the preliminary measures, so that they should only submit to Germany a strong strong manager that has invited the wrong-use and simple solutions; another factor was the establishment of the variety of Czechoslovaquia with a strong minority, the function of a five colleagues should also be able to make it easily.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds started the foundation of the missionist movement, in which a duration tried to establish a Jewish State, most possible on the history of Judah with Jerusalem as a capital city (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration has already mentioned the provision for the massage of Jews to Palestinian; it has come to first meeting with the Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The second World War has come out, and now, if Hitler from the category lossis, where the international banks had first maintained him, or whether everything has been planned, is only difficult to consider, in any case, the pain of the European Jews in the concentration officers the provision for the recognition of the Jewish State through the world community.
Israel was based in 1948, and as prepared by war repairs against Germany for the Second World War, the call of the State of Israel provides the design of the fire point for the third World War.
If the international bankers are raised to defend this war, the Jewish people will be like in the second world war for the victim in the previous battle, this time together with the Arabic or Muslim population of the nearest East.
Israel is like a serious labour, a source of war and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also in the international (the man only thinks how the people shared themselves in the attachants and the hosts of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where wrong is solved only in an endless spirit of violence, where the Gier of individuals and their constraints were in the beginning of the world's power?
There must be a difference between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international banks in Israel are also the same as us, the people, except their own candidates to choose.
The current Presidency of Israel, the Falk Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fashismus-dependence, which has made the international banks loyal policies to make all to make a war with Iran, which is in view of the Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan), quickly exceeds a global conflict, and with which Iran's control over the only 2 miles of the breed strategy of Hormus, which is about 20% of the worldwide expenses that could come to the world's destruction.
In which light, David Rockefeller's words appeared out of 1994: "The only thing we need is a surprising crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
The new world order is a world of the Lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of human population serves a small group of financialistokrates.
A world in which every new birth in the birth will be planted a chip to submit this way of the total control.
"And it makes the small and the great, the riches and the poor, the freedom and the servants all give a sign to their right hand or to their skins that no one can buy or sell, but he has the sign, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
This is wisdom! He who has understanding overcomes the number of animals.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred sixty-sixty."
The film Argo: If it's the worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a Mob more demonstrating Islamist Students in Teheran took the US News and took 52 diplomates as Gessels.
For their freedom, they requested the delivery of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, which was fled after the revolution in the United States, which had been protected by the Patronat over the rule of his government over ten years.
For the American Government there was no positive way of this situation - she could not be able to move the sight over the boat because it had been massively disappointed by the trust of their companies in other countries.
In the same time, she was not in Iran, where the revolution had sent down in the implementation of a theokratic regime to continue the freedom of the islands.
It was a serious threat for the call of the United States, and the then Fiasko in the violent trial of the freedom made everything worse.
The captive diplomates were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were delivered by the Algerian Government.
The shiproom of the islands called to house a weight of solidarity and anti-iranic rules.
The Debakel in Iran was highly raised up Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan at the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the Register and Shooter Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that protected the United States a little party.
Initially, before the message was established, six newsworkers had the flight.
This ended after several complications in the residence of the Canadian Messenger.
The CIA had been in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the flights from Iran, which helped them a extravagant story to deteriorate their true identity - they were traveled with Canadian payments as members of a film stage, which was offered to visit a film of science.
Combination of Genres
The expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed plan also made the need for Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to be faithful, the article on this film project appeared in training magazines, the press conferences were held, and the fixed production company had a real office.
The details of this operation has been maintained long secretly. The film supports the reminders of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of many films.
On one side, he is a realistic politician, but also a "Caper Movie", such as the story of a lieous husers, such as the film of the Ocean's eleven.
Thus, in the film, the vote levels can be changed – on one side the documentary scenes from Teheran (in the title sequence are shown iconical time Genesis photographs, and also in the film of the same situations there is no great difference).
On the other hand, the locking passes from Hollywood, which are ironical and easily overspitched.
And then there's still the scenes of the CIA Centre and other institutions - men in the conversation table, on the office flows, on the phone...
Ben Affleck is able to restart his carriers with this film.
From a famous shoe player has become a respective register, and also as a shoe player is now not the objective of ironical comments.
Argo is his third game film after the Crime No children game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller city without grace (2010).
Eventually, it is the first film of Affleck, which is not playing in the home boston of the register.
The idea for the atmosphere of the location is the characters that remove the previous films of this register from the standard Hollywood.
However, Affleck shows this idea also in Argo where Teheran from Canada is "played".
The best scenes of the movie play in the streets and show the rebuilding of events that have actually found - the income sequence of the first storage of the message is very impressive in their overseer, and also provides the feeling of disobedience and inheritability that comes when the story moves.
A similar effect causes Affleck with his team also in efficient scenes (the false film table on a base in Teheran).
Too many actions to many places
The register also had to agree that the story actually does not provide a lot of exciting scenes in the film.
However, he works rightly with the Wendy, sometimes he helps the reality - what then does not always affect so elegant (the scenes in which the aircraft crisis in Teheran will be used from a telephone in America, or also the persecution year on the beginning board, works something).
The weakness of Argo is his very wide training, which is required by the need to show too much in action in many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood Middlemans, very charm, but their figures would have rewarded more spaces, and so they are not alone in the film.
Afflecks movie loses something to access. It's a movie that you can persecute with some interests, and then you can buy the structure and to a trillors from the 70s.
But it's only difficult.
As a reminder to a certain way of history of life to this day, and as a evidence of the proposals of the powerful and all-wise secret services, he is sufficient.
Directives for airballs, bananes and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplattky.com, who calls an annual question on the absurdest bank buyers, has decided to establish the concurrence of the "exhorting Regulation or ideas from the EU's area".
"To this idea, the longest plan introduced by the EU to introduce a 40% of women in the management of great European company," said Patrick Nerr, who care for the organization of this question, against the Provo magazine.
For example, under the nominated absurdities, the Court of the European Court on the Union of the Security Staff for men and women.
Before this, women offered a price for life-security, because they are objectively representing a smaller risk for security society.
"And incredible accidents from the EU may be nominated until the end of this year.
The actual vote is then followed until the end of February 2013, and the neighbors shared.
The comprehensive EU Regulations include the connection of bioethanol to substances that are naturally dangerous in their consequences, and further the prohibition of the permissions of the quick silvertermometers, only because this is a relative small quantity of this substance, or also the Directive on the size of the hair-country, which has been significantly worthy of the eggs in this year.
In the past criteria, the factic prohibition of the use of the term "Butteroutstrech" or also the sale for original glasses.
Banners must be 14 cm long
The EU apparedit decides often under the pressure of this or the lobby of trade and industry which will be submitted in Brussels in accordance with a or many Member States (e.g., the Chess now trying to follow the requirements of the Czech Banks with veto-drog).
Lobby's interests also found that the bathrooms of the highest trade class in the EU have to be at least 14 cm long and not show the "combustion annually".
The European Commission defended the argument that they were only harmonised by the unique national standards that would prevent the trade.
The standards relating to bottles and meat were already rejected by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the evidence that the previous directives would lead to a forgiving of food.
A candidate for the reaching in this review may be the EU Regulation of the past year which should be considered in accordance with airballons when selling the indication that children can not be able to attach the airball for eight years without a view to a growth.
The EU was also called to a American study, which is, according to airballons, the causes leading by children's raising death.
A similar limit is already applied for children to 14 years in the use of annual market rate.
Curiose accidents are also home
Relative absurd is also a directive that concerns the European employees themselves - everyone who takes a official function in the EU may not use the sensitivity of the subject for Greece and must say, instead of the FYROM (Former Yugoslava Republic of Macedonia).
The Bank Polatky.com server named in cooperation with the Liberal Economies Laissez Faire near the absurdities, including the EU Regulation on the achievement of food proposals in the area of a Member State.
The EU has therefore established the maximum volume of food proposals that are in the area of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU approach.
Tchechien then passed over the fixed volumes for pill conservation, for which we had a high money train.
The organisations of the question were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should have money for them that they have no sea, or by the idea of payer to pay payers for the applicants.
These ideas are not free of Brussels but of Prague.
"We are noticed that we have no sea.
We will be requested to replace the EU," explained in 2004 by the Daily Agriculture Ministry Jaroslav Palas (CHSSD).
As a argument, he concluded that the treatment was very high and that the State guard was fulfilled according to the market of intervention.
Since the Chess have another way to seat, the EU should pay for us hundreds of million euros according to Palas.
The European Commission concluded that the Czech Commission was so long that they organized a statement on the purchase of products from countries that have no access to the sea.
Assistance providers for requests on assistant, the Community provides the Ministry for Regional Development under the leadership of the Ministry Pavel German (US-DEU), and it should be particularly aware of the means for the establishment of funds to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are the exception
However, the regulations in Member States are easily easy to achieve the crisis, the efforts of the EU to regulate and thus also on the effectiveness and development of the European Union, according to the opinion of some experts.
A serious problem, in view of these experts, is more than the EU funders for projects that have not been common with the degradation of European integration, which have been adopted in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also refer to the fact that the Czech Research is like other Member States in Brussels for the right to use specific indications of traditional products and not always win this fight.
However, after a six-year-year fight with Germany and Austria, the name "Olomoucke tvarůžky", the Inlanders (Tuzemische rum), which was returned to us to the 19th century, our manufacturer had to be renamed to "Tuzemak".
The label Room should be used only for products from sugar raw destillation, not for products of sugar rubber.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, there are also the Carlsbader Zweback, the carpents from Pohorelice and Trüboň, or also the Saazer Hopfen.
With a EU market, the pardubizer libkucher or the horizer rollen can be broken.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just a Amator," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how are you going to candid the idea for the office of the President?
I don't mean to be Senator or President.
If all in our country would work without problems, I wouldn't condemn anywhere.
But I can't see how the Republic will be planned for 20 years and how the disease will be released, while the people will increase the steel and the purchase.
I didn't have an ambitiation to be political.
But if I see something I don't like, I'm trying to propose a solution to change this.
And since I'm over 40, and independent and partilos, I have no other opportunity to influence things than to candidate the office of a senator or the President.
In the Senate you made it and then made you the way to the town.
Do you not turn your choices back to the back?
I've told me all the time that I'll take the fight against the city after the result of the senate elections.
Afterward, I have submitted this and said that I will be candidate for the office of the President, if I will be chosen to the Senator.
My goal is not the function, but the function is a tool that I can realize my visions.
For this, I may need a lot of influences and a strongest mandat.
But the difficulty is not only in that we are being a people in the neighbors and before the television, but every one who wants to change something.
The medias that want to be raised to be honored, and that are lying to replace the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was considered that I would pay journalists or that I was a Berater of Jire Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight against the Burg you have taken with the tea of the material and criminal captures of policies and with exceeding more than 20 million crowns.
You need to change the laws.
As President, you have no competents in this regard, and only the senate can introduce law proposals.
How do you want to resolve this problem?
As a simply citizen I have used that the traveller remains a free warm, and this could be implemented.
The problem is the smallest policy - if someone comes from the right or left with a good proposal, this will be aware often rejected, and that is only the population.
As an independent party, I have a vital greater potential to win support in all the parties represented in the Parliament.
My party is that I can take it to me without the loading thoughts and partidogs of every party, which is the best for our country.
Do you see yourself as human in the policy right or left?
From the Chess vision, I seem like people see me more left.
I have this right-left-left thoughts, but it's absolutely unbelievable.
It's important for me that we're going.
I don't mean if someone listen to the left or right guard, I want to connect people.
Stets supports publicly every good solution, even if it comes from the KSCHM or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
It's missing you if someone calls you as a popularist.
But you don't confirm what you just said?
If you create a business plan in a company, you also have a ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to get close to this.
This is because of my popularisme, but all proposals I have spoken are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in the Parliament, you are only smoking words.
And that's why you don't get long in the policy.
Or do you think it's you if you're talking for a long enough time to speak to people, for example, to continue material and criminal treatment?
I have no other opportunity.
Political, journalists and publicity, and try to bring them to our side to continue these objectives.
As President, I would not have a problem to request the Presidents of the Parliament's parties live in the television to legally reduce the material and criminal arrest for policies, officers, judges and officers.
And the calls should say why they deny it.
A strong personality that indicates mistakes can take pressure on the political scene.
Just once take the direct election of the President who was a service of the public pressure.
I'm very clear that I'm a Amateur; I'm not a genius or an intellectual tuler.
I'm trying to find connections for my views and views.
I just started with the policy and tried to find support for my programme.
I'm always trying to assess the things myself; and if it doesn't get it, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a little bit as if Okamaura should save the Chechien.
I'm not a story.
I know that I don't get anything alone; therefore, I have spoken with several known persons about whether they want to candid the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Janczura, who refused to work over.
Furthermore, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencova, who discovered the training with light heizol.
My candidate begins with the condition that people are deeply disappointed, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty per cent of the election officers have not gone to the elections, and those who have passed have chosen most representatives of the statution.
We're only two independent in the Senate.
People have chosen such a sentence meeting that the changes will be very difficult to transform.
However, I will fight for my visions, for example, for the direct election of the citizens and civilian members.
Do you think the foundation of a own party?
I still didn't think of that because I have no time to check the past every potential party member, and I have no money for that.
I have no money for the President campaign yet; on my transparency account only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have money?
You are talking about explanations, how do you see?
I appreciate about about 60 million CZK.
In Prag, I have a basic piece with a value of 25 million, a apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an artist collection that is about 10 million, and a Aston Martin for 3,5 million and a scoody Superb, which is about a million, and then I have a few millions on the account.
Aston Martin was still a child dream - James Bond had always enjoyed me as he went into the car, was galant to women, and at the same time battled against the evil.
You're going to a Aston Martin, have a cost of 60 million and don't have money for your campaign?
They say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest in it your own money.
It's not just convinced.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
I want to make some crimes?
I've already put 2,5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program doesn't have much interests.
And I'm not committed to fight the campaigns from their own media.
The costs for the campaign are taken based on my maintenance as Senator.
But from the content of the Senator I couldn't live alone; for example, I could not finance the English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to pay money, I wouldn't candidate for nothing.
So do you continue to work as a companies to have your expenditure?
Didn't you say you're going back to these activities?
But it doesn't belong to the height of the maintenance.
As I promised, I was part of my activities.
This is, for example, my representative in the early year's office manager of the travel office.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saved the Republic.
But I have to live for something.
In what month income did you be employed?
It's about 200,000 to 400,000, and it's still like this.
However, as President, I would make my undertakings completely.
The full conversation is found in the Saturday Expenditure of Provo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of shirts and the recent books - 2 photos
"I find the building pleasant to look futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Rehaig, a pasteur in the street border.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technology in a nearby big company, says, "No, it's good, the house."
But I ask why we need another book today.
All have Internet, iPad and E-books.
No man goes free today in one of this old style libraries, right?
The skins, a no long-term sleep town before the Rotterdams Tores, is a special recorder.
The 8000,000 resident community shows the less education rate of all the Netherlands.
In order to affect this dumb circumstances, you decide to contribute to the general education and to build the seven efficient bridges on the euros as well-pleased steel beton miniatures.
The success of the education official was in the limits.
And so the town fathers recognised that there was only one opportunity to be the statistics' Lord: a library must be here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture Office MVRDV, Master of the furniture ball graphics and products of whistlings, very often took the thing with resident integrity and appeared to concurrent hearing in 2003 with five books under arm and a grind in the face.
And while the jury still looked for himself and looked with the assess, the fresh Maas stole his reading assembly of the size after a pyramid and finished his activist undermaid speaking with the words: "Love town community!"
That's why he's my proposal for the booksberg of skins, for the likely named Bookenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros have been safe.
He is a part of a revolutionary project, which is also a deep-garage, supermarket, post and a few limited residents and room households with entire 50 apartments.
In the beginning of November, the bookberg was designed with the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
Moreover, the project for the German National Wood Award 2012 is nominated.
This is the invisible small town treatment that would not have been offered to be more than a post-moderal foot zone and a fascinating raw rathaus, behind that white fascinations would be allowed to promote a molebreaking box to make a piece of time-continent architecture richer.
However, in particular, the first public culture building is now available in the history of his existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Bookereldorado under coffee locks.
There is a lift that leads in the middle of the mountain massive, but the real room and reading joys are recognized when the topography is fulfilled.
The round flowed inside is light and overseen, the burned clinics and the elegant street latters speak unbelievablely the language of a public city place.
The city environment is perfect.
You are already looking at Parkbank, dogs and football playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books.
"Normally, the book rules are within the fashion, and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is most incompatible and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on the head and set the reading area outside.
The inside of the bookberg is used: In the middle of the offices, Internet libraries, challenges clubs, environment center and home technology center.
A special joy is the black book rules, which are once wall dressed, sometimes browsing, sometimes steel country.
Optic, haptics and rumors are foreign.
Even incorruptible architectures and builders protect the head of the unknown material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the city community springs, on the request of the standard.
And so we have been struggled in a freeland agricultural industry one day on a suitable department product from the agricultural.
Since many years are used in the Netherlands in woodhouses and in fields a milimeter dance of arts as a radial base.
That's a lot of and demo-effective.
The dark textil holds, two saisons, then it is reif for the shirt.
For the library, the Flee - first in these quantities - to four cents deep platts.
Under Hitze infection and pressure, the same agricultural plastic (KLP) is to a dark, homogeneous, loadable material, which leads a bits to new car and a bitsl to sportschuh.
After 105 levels, you've been attached to the gipfel.
At the end of about 500 meters of long wavership, it is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also with the Netherlands crockets and incapable ficus trees.
They are concerned for atmosphere, especially for the correct airport in literature.
Speed for the new soul
"Man wouldn't believe it, but this house is a prospect project in point ecology," says Trouborst.
Health and emotion is made with earthquakes.
Although the bookberg is under a glass tourism, the sun seems to be sooner days only short inside.
The wide tree limblings that are almost at the glassface, serve as a smoking and started a large part of the sun-including.
The room climate is very nice.
The rest of the full-automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the starting sceptic from the IT bank, has already reached the way to the new books.
Lisette's too famous.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Godarde, which is called the bookenberg as a "length overall soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to send a book from his personal material.
This should first be fulfilled by the optical library in which is still not completely increasing library - at present 70,000 pieces.
The concept has gone up.
The rules are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-library," says Architec Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation now every resident has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just at the apartment.
This is the MVRDV of the king's discipline that you call in the Fachjargon Identification.
The story has written literature history.
So young and unimaginate she also likes to be.
It's finally an adjustment point for identity.
Szabo: "The Germany needs to play greater role"
Germany has been voted in the vote on the vote of Palestinian.
According to Stephen Szabo, experts for US European relations, Berlin balanced them on a small diplomatic grade.
German wealth: In the beginning of the week, Germany signed first that it would vote against the request to a monitoring state of Palestinian in the United Nations.
But then, Berlin's gotta get out.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Germany must now be careful because of his special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time I believe it doesn't support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - however, without being critical against Israel.
During the resort in Libya in March 2011, Germany also had the voice as it was to establish a aircraft zone.
This was finally conducted by the NATO.
Is it difficult to Germany to take a clear position in important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is the fact that it is just converting its external policy and that it is away from a policy that has been invited by the United States to a German external policy.
The Europeans have no coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are in contrast between the fronts.
They expect them to play an independent role, but they are not usually.
I think they still have taken their role, but they are on the way to a "normal" external policy.
A external policy, such as the French or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" external policy mean as concrete from German view?
It shows the opportunity to take place in national interests, which are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German external policy is motivated by the economic policy, so by exports and its relations to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the nearest east.
The German economic interests are at a certain level different than the other big forces and therefore Germany needs to protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the maintenance of the Nahost conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
For one, Germany has large markets in the nearest east, especially in the golf countries.
Therefore, it must be careful that publicity, but also the Elites should not stand before the head in the Arab countries.
It plays a role in any case.
But I wouldn't want to take that too much weight, that's not completely a single relationship.
But it plays a significant role in German disciplines.
Has Germany harmed his relationship with the United States by maintaining important vote decisions, as well as the vote on Palestinian?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States is a great understanding for the German position.
That is why I don't think that this was a so dramatic brochure, as in the library question.
Perhaps Germany will also play a certain respect.
Because it signifies that it is serious to be taken as international players and needs to be considered in its interests.
There are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States were clear to speak for a veto.
Is there various opinions between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Government under Obama has very much understanding for the European position.
However, because of the political situation here, the Government can certainly not represent this position publicly.
I believe that real opinions are not so big as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and the Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so close to the Netanjahus policy.
Is it difficult to Germany to join its entire relations with Israel and the United States on one and to the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I think that's exactly hard for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germans if it gives a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not now the case.
So they can't be part of a larger line and have to prevent things from their own position.
They're just doing this with the euro.
I believe in the future, Germany will take a leader role to attach Europe to a European position.
Of course, it is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
It was always a funny theme.
But I think the German is clear that they have to play an independent role.
Is German himself in the role as an important international player - Will Germany take a major role?
Or does Germany still fall the rule of guidance?
The Germany is not yet common, that is still unfair and, for the obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the Eurocrisis, there will be every time when Germany receives a greater role, the different anti- German feelings will be free.
That's not easy to the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be restricted from enemies.
So, Germany is in a lot of difficult position than the United States.
It must be anxious for various neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Now the impact of the United States in the European policy continues, but the EU is not fulfilled at the moment of this vacuum, who remains there?
The Germans are just to play a greater role.
Even if it doesn't like them, it's unbelievable to them, and it's a lot of unbelievable - it's life!

"Mark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani are finally Chinese
Armani is a worldwide mark, Polo Ralph Lauren.
What's Armani Polo?
There is an official label in China, which does not have anything to do with the original companies.
However, she enjoys so long protection, as the real namers do not bear.
And even then it isn't clear if they get right.
"It's always difficult for foreign countries to protect their markets in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the Canzley Taylor Wessing, who is specialized on the protection of the rights in Fernost.
Every week a new case on my desktop.
The neighbors have already a few additional letters to log in their marks.
So it's just from Gucci Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada let Prada-Kny enter.
The German companies will also be copied in this way, as well as the sport article manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with inputs of the Market Agency in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company has protected Zegna DF Puma's product mark, a single name of the artist, which also in the modem of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese world masters are in copies and last spiritual property are known.
In the large cities there are multiple buying houses that are almost exclusively sold failures.
But Pattloch's cases are different: In the task of his mandaters, he suggests that the Chinese company of the market is officially obtained the right to use a label that has already been protected differently.
The Chinese calls the "Bang Mingpai", a trademark.
The word is orientated to "Bang Dakuan".
That's how women are joining rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not conscious of sin.
"This is business, you have to fight it," asked Pattloch.
"The mark is decreased to disappear the only arrangement, the image shield is great."
Financial deficits and the process costs of the involved markets go into the millions, especially in low-providing products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the third largest market for Luxus articles and the fastest growth.
However, the eliminations of dubious items in the market register are hard to get and go into the money.
For nine years, the procedure may be made with an unknown exit.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the Court declines, because after the long time of the name concerned has become "Marktreality".
If the customer has Pech, he needs to pay the plagitor even money because he lost his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
More cases include graphical elements.
2009 Daimler lost a right straight line with the manufacturer Sany, the company who recently took the German betonpumpenbauer Putzmester.
Thus, the Chinese can use an emblem like Mercedes stars until today.
The Volvo Buyer Geely used originally a blue-white logo that remembered BMW; the war was declared, Geely had to change it.
The model manufacturer Lacoste died in China against the neighborhood from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had looked at the pretty crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not convinced.
The Market Agency CTMO in Beijing believes that it has been given there in 2010 for small personal and room equipment.
But in the past year, you are returned from the note status in the workshop to normality.
That is how the file of uneditored interruption procedure is to be added to 22 per cent.
Fast 57,000 of these cases have been completed, 75 percent more than the previous year.
However, 81.500 in the office is still expected.
A lot of days to be achieved
How often the numbers are impressive in China.
In the past year, more than 1,4 million requirements for market protection were added to the CTMO, a third party more than 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China takes the list of new announcements in the world at ten times behind each other, the authority shares.
This also applies to the file of all valid marks, total 5,5 million pieces.
2011, 1,8 billion Yuan has been adopted in the birthdays.
Simply means that each login costs 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
In this case, a variety costs, as shows the case of the German family company of joydenberg.
Since more than seven years, the concerts fight against a Chinese platformer.
In fact, the Germans could have achieved that the illegal manufacturer had been exhausted.
However, the neighbor continued the Chinese rights in the market of gladdenberg.
You have even disappeared that you could not be protected in Germany family names, says Hanno Wentzler, the Chairman of the Employment of Friedenberg Chemical Specialities in München.
The Market Agency CTMO, as well as the intention of the municipality.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg has been right, but the processer fights until today.
You need to be higher
Now the matter is attained before the Supreme Court.
The Wentzler is conscious to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionality of the weakness.
But he also says, "This procedure is extremely useful and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were unable to assume that the company archive has even needed to check annually old acts in order to prove.
Five years ago, pleudenberg of the party offered a "height-six euro-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-sized euros".
"So you see how much this is value for us," say Wentzler.
The risks in Fernost were even driving back to Europe.
Then, if imitators are sure that they are not protected marks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to report the label of pleudenberg for shoes and leaders.
This business field has given the concert longer, however, he could disappear the registration.
"Man needs to be higher," says Wentzler.
He and the lawyer Pattloch decided to be very careful in businesses with China.
It is not rich to leave the international market rights, most of the strangers should "all that is a protection value, even in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this may be much more courageous than the registration.
In fact, if pleudenberg is undertaken in the last act of his market drama, you should likely pay the license payment for your own name, the Wentzler explains.
Or we will be deprived in the questionnaire segment from the market.
Worldday: Stamps, singers, help
In Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi and Swaziland have enjoyed Aids.
The story of a connection that overrides more than 8733 kilometers.
First there's the shopping: Cowboys tickets, basketball shoe, ladies pumps and Mrs. Lipper are looking for the tattoo, find him quickly.
One-2-3-4.
Then the voices of the songs will be slowly to - old, bass, tenor and sopran - smoking, and persecution.
And Fite Hop, the 29-year-old officers, had almost made it out of his substance, when he assembled them with his worried desires.
It is Montgabend, in the musiccraum of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, a new song of Chor Imbongi.
At the fifty songs and songs, between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humentheticr to the homeman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every chromosome has another text and these also in a very strange language: Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Aid to self-help
There are about 34 million HIV infects around the world, which estimates Unids, the United Nations Programme for AIDS.
23,5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245000 AIDS are living.
More than 40% of the population are in HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS in Esitjini town, the United States Voices for Africa Paten found in Germany.
70 of them visit a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros in the month, you can take a patientship.
She guarantees the child's school money, education and a warm age day in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means Zulu story reporter or lobpriceser.
The Bantus language can flexible speak in this room, but sing.
Since about ten years, the Chor songs enters in this strange strange language and brings them back and also back where they are originally come: in South Africa.
Because 8 733 miles of airline from Heidelberg, north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitgeni, which depends on the officer of the German Chores.
Fourty percent are infected
Almost 2000 people live there, some are still in simple living and shoes, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because these are raised to the HIV virus.
In Esitgeni, the smallest where Swaziland is disease: the highest HIV infection ratio, the latest expectation of life in the world is low to UNICEF.
The concepts of the men's advantages that indicately reduce the risk of reaching the half of the population will not be adopted.
More than 40 per cent of people in Swaziland takes the Immune Weight Virus to die with the midst of 30% is not sale.
At a common African road in March 2005, the Chor detected the town, especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets that it was not only in old precursors, but it was very difficult to be: food, clothing, education.
Without school conclusion, there's no chance in a poor country.
In the beginning, it was still the private engagement individuals to send a child to school for a few euros in the year and allow him a warm period on the day.
However, for a year later, the Chor founded the Treaty "Voices for Africa", which would be nearly professional about the AIDS matters in Esitgeni.
Infections to sexual transmission infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI numbers Syphilis, Chlamdians and Trippers (Gonorrhe).
Frequency viral STI are HIV, Human Pappilomovies, Herpes genatalis or hepatitis.
Float flowers and rubbers are the parallel STI.
Who are the main groups?
Syphilis and Tripper are in particular with men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute says that at least four of five of all of the Syphilis cases reported in Germany by sexual contacts between men.
In the heroesexual adults, chlamdien infections, trichomonaden, Candidese (Pilz), Tripper and Human Pappilomovies are often caused sexually transmittable diseases.
The expansion of HIV is under theerosexual adults in comparison with this country - however, 20 per cent of HIV new infections depend on this group.
Through young people, chlamdien infections are most often more than in other population groups.
After European highlights, three fourth of all infections of young people between 15 and 25 years.
In this country, people are often advanced by people in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are mistaken.
The number of Syphilis infections has been more than doubled by the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections is returned since 2007.
2011 there was about 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the year ago.
What symptoms are shown to a sexual disease?
Infection diseases can be called in the genital area, injuries in urination, exposure, supply diseases, tables or products.
However, often they cause no pain or other symptoms and remain unmarried.
How can you protect yourself?
Condome can reduce the risk of an attack, but not offer a hundred percentage protection.
Because, in part, the risks of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by chemical effects and body contacts.
It is therefore recommended by experts, especially in a regular review of sexual partners.
Tomorrow diagnosises most STI can be safely and rejected.
By patients, speeds, and not recently the gains that the crowd reaches in all Germany, some are together.
"We have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitgeni," says Annette Lennartz, the President of the United Kingdom.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and traditional woman, the money from Germany.
She's also concerned that the weapons are good, even at one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women named Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 challenges, give them a cup over the head, and care that children in their uniforms appear at the point every day to school.
Whoever has anybody more, comes to Khanyisile's protection house, a single woman who is paid exactly from the Treaty as both cookers who cook for more than 200 hungry children each day.
Furthermore, "Voices for Africa" called a neighbor school in life, built two homes and organized with the American Health Organization PSI that many have made a HIV test in the village.
This is not self-comprehensive, because of course, the disease is also in the whole country, it is the most lovely dead.
A King with 14 wives
"Aids is a absolute tabu," says Annette Lennartz, "cause it has to do sexuality."
Really wonderful in a country where the King has 14 marriages.
The last absolute Monarch Black Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of Democracy.
On the other hand, this stately sanctioned life form has also been declared that the HIV virus has expanded so quickly in the past decades.
But also the many wandering workers who carry the virus through country.
Uncostenous condomes, however, says Annette Lennartz, "but they will not be used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor reaches two, three years together through South Africa, and sings songs full weakness, fighting, overseer and black self-security, who know many in the south of the black continent still from the time of the apartment.
A bus full of white, singing the songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only vote and joy, but also a few grimful front soldiers have broken a few dress.
The travel is also going to Esitgeni, where the songs are visiting their patent children.
Even if you find the small village on the ground maps, it is more known in the valley of Azulveni flows.
"Go to Esitgeni, there's the light," people say there.
And when the 8733 miles of airline return to Heidelberg, to the stealing songs in the Proveraum at the mountain's street, you can also see it light.
Messager: NASA detected the ice on the Merkur
The last messager found evidence that there is on the planet Merkur Eis.
The skin should be low to 20 meters.
The US Room Authority has notified the existence of ice at the planet market.
Although the sun is next, there is also wounded water, such as three studies published on Sunday in the fashion magazine "Science".
The last messenger found evidence that there is a ice scene in the shadow of the planet.
This shall be at least 30 centimeters and even to 20 meters dick.
The water was probably come from comates or even assteroids that are in the Mercury.
But no one brings the foundation of Eis with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientists of the Messaging Sun, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Merkur can get to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the fountains could help to clarify how water and other buildstones of life are achieved in other areas of the sun system.
Unmarried by the earthly citizens are Sund, Telescope and small robots like Phoenix to study the depths of the world.
From time to time, they send images to the earth: small smokers in unfinite ways.
The image comes from a camera developing German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our sunsystems, including the fourth planet Ceres.
As Pluto, creating behind Neptun around the sun, Ceres is not "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This image section of the Infrarot Telescope shows a "Family port" generations unrecommended star generations: the oldest stars are to recognize as blue points, hard to identify are the pink colors "New born" in the star crisis.

The Donut-formal Ring is from the material that the stars were exceeded in the star-procedure.
In a huge trifid nebel, 5400 light years away from the earth, are out of gas and steel new stars.
The Spitzer Telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the galaxy birth level.
The Plejadan stars, also called "The seven sisters", can be seen with the only eye night.
However, with the telescope, the colors are better to use.
As a red eye looks at the Helix Nebel on this infrarot photo to the viewer.
He is 700 light years away in the Aquarius Star Image.
His similarity with a earthquake continent brought this nebel in the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrarot photos is concerned for the spektacule colouring.
These babysters could be taken in his full beauty only by the Infrarot Dectors of the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and its rings: As these are, it is one of the great astronomy rates.
Maybe they are the rest of a Saturn Mountain, which has lost 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and smoothest captures of the Hubble Telescope: the whirlpool galaxie
After coloring is taken from spiralgalases to real artworks.
The reception published by the European Southern Water shows the trifid nebel remote for several thousands of light years.
The name Trifid is the latin word trifidus (trew, three-shared), since the dark steel streams divide the gleamed heart of the stars.
In the stereo image, the astronomes have photographed the proposals of a cosmic karabole: 400 million light years from the earth are removing the kernels of two smoking galaxies to each other and will be collided unlikely with each other.
These stars gears showed the Hubble Telescope in the Spiralgalacse M83.

The 1400 Light Year's Nebel is from shipping corners, which are ten to hundred times smaller than a normal household.
This picture has been collected from optical and rentgen receptions of various telescopes.
It shows a ring from black leather, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, took the world roomsheep Hubble for the nasa.

Even these stars, connected to the roset nebel, brings new babysters running - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this brilliant smoking galaxie with a small black loch there is no gas, but only gas.
Researchers claimed that he was almost after the origin as to find an existing water substance in the universe.
Our impressions in All: the most important telescope
The telescope should be found by Hans Lipperhey, 1608, before Galileo Galilee was used a year later to observe the stars.
Since the speeds of the optic telescope were always greater - and the impressions that they provide were always deep.
30 years ago, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope in the Palomar Observatorium near San Diego was the biggest television of the world.
The Spigel, here in the picture, had a average of five meters.
In Arizona, United States, the large Binocular Telescope.
It allows the views in all equally over two speeds, everybody with a smoke of 8,4 meters.
The inner life of the Grand Telescopio Canarias on the Canaries Island La Palma is a lot - only the speed comes at 10,4 meters in the sky.
The speed of South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
However, he gets a smoker of about 11 meters.
Part of good buildings: The telescope is set in its height angle - and it is restricted in its movement.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the high-wind.
His speciality: the high light collection.
This is so much - however, compared to small speed smoking massage - to the largest speed telescope worldwide.
With the help of a radiotelescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to all foreign signals.
The radio-telescope has a smooth massage of 305 meters.
The "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help any computer employees by providing accounting.
See the Observatory of the European Star War (ESO) in the Chileans.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - that makes his name all honor.
With its total four speeds, the television can also light the average infrarot spectrum.
In addition, on the chinese ESO Observatorium, the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
His main speed should be set up in 42 meters - and on the button 1000 speed elements will be set together.
But with images it is to calculate the last 2018.
Since 2007, the two Keck Telescopes at the Hawaii Vulkan Mauna Kea as the largest world.
They offer two speeds with one average of ten meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatorium, which still looks close to them with the subaru telescope and the IRTF in the sky.
Moreover on the Mauna Kea, a new, big telescope - with a speed average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be found on a illustration.
However, the most important instructions of all gives the world roomshop Hubble.
Since 24 April 1990, it has already provided pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, Kepler seeks extrasolary planets - especially those who are inhabitants.
On 2 February 2011, Naza was announced that 1235 Planet Canadians were discovered since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture, the last starting preparations are documented in the world room roomsheet Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has been shooting at the board of ariane5 rackets in all.
The primary speed of the World Infrarot Scope has a steel of 6,5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It must look after the light of the first stars and galaxies after the original.
Scientifics say that there is also in the South Pool of the Mercur Eis.
However, there is no loss data that the messengers are drawn closer to the north Poland around the planets.
Radar meetings have noticed that it exists in the East Mercury since decades.
Through the 2004, the first messenger-sund - the first creating around the Mercur -- the scientists have now been awareness.
Today drink butter - and 168 years old
In the South Azerbaidschan, many people have a Bible - high age.
There's even a museum for long-length.
A spring search in the country where 97-year-olds are still likely young.
In the South Azerbaidschan, many people have a Bible - high age.
There's even a museum for long-length.
A spring search in the country where 97-year-olds are still likely young.
The traveling through the Talish Gebirge is to call wildromanticly.
The small bus rolls over the corven rich roads, belongs to quickly maintained hills, riding flows and simple building houses.
Everything is green and sad, you can say you're in the black whales.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaidshan, the border to Iran is only a few miles away.
This is the Cashian people group of the Talibans, which is not much known except that they speak Persian and Aseric and are very loving.
End station is Lerik.
The small cities are prolonged with a great architecture from soviet times that does not want to pass in the Malays mountains.
Tourists from Europe are quite aware of that the attack of Aserbaidschan headtown Baku is not in Europe.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the streets are only involving.
The declarable riches that thank the land of its oil in the Caspace Sea has not yet come here in the provinces.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has a witness to tourist treatment.
"Baku was blessed in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the most oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum for long-termness, even the only world.
Here is the Vita of about eight thousand talents from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136, there is a child
However, the restrictive star of the Museum is the shepherd Shirali Muslumov, who should be 168 years old.
However, there is no born origin.
And in view of the elderly documented people who were 122 years old, Muslumov's age appears out of doubt.
"1805 he was born here in the region, 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The husband was married three times and had 23 children, and in the age of 136 he must have born a daughter.
So Shirali Moslumov was compared to his age for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Schulz, an older researcher in the Max-planck Institute in Rostock, has heard from the high-beaches in the Mediterranean.
"And in some areas of China, Japan, or Hunza-tal in Pakistan," says Schulz, "and in Sardinian lives extremely many very old men."
However, by missing documents, there is no scientific indication about the age to lose a person’s registry.
Each day safely smoked butters
However, it is actually that people around the region often get a Bible age of age.
Today there are 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why do they live here in the South?
The Asserian Travel Leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special gens of the Talisans.
The Museum Director Fatulayeva believes that it is in food.
However, that the calorian costs of the Talisans should be so healthy, love the flesh, bread, and in particular the milk products and drink a glass on the day, there appears not exactly to be placed out of food scientists.
Or is it the original life of the people who are young? In Cenheimiran, a wind apartment within the city of Lerik, inhabited Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years she is still young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, which means to have 143 sequences, lives in a simple tree house that is typically for the whole Caukasus region.
She sits on the ground with a bath phass that she's increasingly rolling.
Eight people live here under a pit, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are the longest parents.
Two little kids also slip inside.
In the kitchen, you are prepared for the guest tee that is served in the typical, built-forme harmadu glass.
Mirzayevas white dentals are perfect in Reih and members, under their heads they turn long, dark-blood skins, whose son is honourable before us.
I've always cut my hair with milk, so they never went out to me and kept their color.
"I haven't used Shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly reward is sufficient for life
She's always eaten what her own hoff is, Tomates, Cartoffels, Heritage.
I didn't solve the only time in the Supermarket food for my whole life.
Then she told her about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in time after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father" Heidar Alayaw took the ruder.
The propaganda sounds amazing from the mouth of a old woman.
However, the culture that is carried out about the fatherfigure of the nation, who ruled his country as a director, knows no longer the borders in Azerbaidscan.
Before 2003, he was in the power, later he took his son Ilham the ruder.
Always there is no note under the Aserbaidschan Old.
230 Manat (as the same sum in Euro), Mirzayeva is a monthly rate for the rate, for a lot of relationships amount of which you can live well.
And maybe Mirzayevas has also been a great son right: "The olders have enjoyed our culture's Honor."
They live in the middle of the large family, will be loved, worried, and are happy.
If it is not a reason to stay as long as possible in life
The word "man's right" is missing in the consideration
The revolution has returned to Kairo.
Rivalised customers in Kairo declare the deep place of the country.
The future comparison with the sharia as base has been increasingly restricted.
The Egyptian President didn't spare with Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in State view.
His speech was directed to all the people, especially to the Christian heads, the Liberals, declared muslims and cellers.
Because they all have lost unexpectedly in a confusive opposition, they have fear.
Be afraid of a God’s State in Nil of grace of the mighty Muslim brothership.
He has, so said Mohammed Mursi, almost apologizing the competents of the Court of Consecution and extending his competents to save the revolution.
However, whatever the 61-year engineer who brings a doctor title of the South California University, really wants to save, the Egyptians are, is not the world entirely in the clergy.
Whether the Judicial should be enhanced
In fact, the 234 articles, which are partly concerned by the 100-heading assembly of the Islamistic Office, have been carried out in a nearly, 15-hour parforcement.
As in previous opinions, it also refers to the draft debate based on the "the principles of the Islamic Right".
But what's the "principes"?
That was, and it is a statement, and it is to be afraid of the Islamists to use the smooth forming and the incoming juristic room for a stricter explanation of the sharia.
This includes at least a newly added article: In all cases regarding Scharia, the Al-Ashar university must be exhausted, the most important Islamic Institution of the country with a great straight force in the Sunitin Islam.
This is not necessary, but it may mean that the spiritity is monitoring the law, what was the fact that the absence of the judicial.
Many in the consent design is an explanation case
It is also problematic: the civil military justice should continue to be maintained.
These fabrics were served during the Government of Mubarak for the impression of opposition cells.
After the study of the Dictor, to 11,000 civilists sat in military.
The State also should, in the design, is "the true ways of the Egyptian family" and promote their moral and their values."
This is legally uncharf that State institutions may also control the contents of movies and literature.
It does not mean anything else than Zensur.
No article remains explicitly writes the equation of men and women.
For this reason, others will forbid the prophet Mohammed and his messengers to be disobedient or disobedient.
But what is a guidance and how it should be dedicated, it remains unclean.
Like Dubios, the formulation must be prohibited by the "function of humans".
Is there enough a caricature of the President or a conscience on the cost of a lawyer?
The explanation, as many in the design, the Mursi provides the signature and, after its words, will be presented to the Egyptians to the people's vote.
"The Revolution has been turned back."
The opposition is formed for weeks against the superintendency of the Islamists.
Ten thousand gathered together in unhabited entrance on the freetaging at the Tahrir Platz in Kairo and promised to bring the Charta in case, even before they could be in force.
"The Revolution has been returned and we will be weak," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third placers of the President's elections.
Mohamed El-Baradei declared the international atomic energy office of Peace Nobel Prices and the ex-head of the International Atom Energy Authority of Mohamed El-Baradei, the Consideration Design "to the Mollberg of History".
Via Kurnical Corn Service Twitter, he approved the Attachors Mursis to lead a "potch against Democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and shoot him," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We're not still weird that the blood of our brothers is not yet occupied," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the reference would not want to monitor how it would be invalid.
"The Koran is our conscience."
The good organizated musulmanship remains on its side to the modern demonstration, however, not at the Tahrir Place, but after a massive prayer on the other Nilufer before the Kairore University.
Many divorced women and advocates of the Salaphists took part of them, and called: "This people requires the use of God's law."
They asked Mursi, "Workers the land!" and said, "The Koran is our conscience."
A fight against the highness of the symbolised Tahrir-platz, on which he took all his beginning, would have been struggled by citizens war.
The Mursis Attachors wouldn't have risked.
The Muslim Brothers explained, as well as the officers of the construction design, as well as the officers would be clearly expressed.
Now be the time to decide the people in the choice, in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the design of the Islamists is applied as safe.
"The word of human rights doesn't come once."
Hafez Abu Saeda is courageous of this forced consistency process, which would actually go to February and include all society forces.
The 48-year-old human rights officer and President of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslims when they were sitting under Mubarak in prison or before the court.
Not because he would share their world vision, but because human rights are independent for him.
He was punished, condemned, arrested.
"And now the word of human rights is not once in the new conscience," he spoke in conversation with the "Well on Sunday."
Mursi power extension on all three officers in the State allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are eklatic disorders against democratic game rules and Egypt will be led to a new dictative.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the President set it out of power," said Saeda.
However, without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels solemn, as well as the international community who considers the ideal direction fight in Nil with a mixing of newspapers and spending.
It could be smoking.
A demonstrant on the Tahrir warnings, "You have a monster you can't control anymore."
Rakfish from Norway: Is this the most poor fish of the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the most highest life standards - not only in Europe but in the world.
Can the success secret of the country have something to do with the local appetite on very bad fish?
You'll take a choice override case sorts.
You will play them in a huge, heavy sport clothing.
And get her there a week.
Soon, you must imagine the rackfish greeting of rackfish, one of the great delikatate Norwegians.
I'm in the small city of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snows, spectacular landscapes - and these hard fruits in the air that just don't want to leave.
Rakfisk is with Salz's increasing forelles, the - depending on how stinking your fish would like - to a year in water.
When the darkness comes over the country and the weather is cutting, Norwegians are stretched to a festival here in Fagernes, which is now very higher speciality.
"Man is red and then spread it down with a glass Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local firewall, but as so named "Rakfisk-General" also the festival.
In order to spend us a small fish bottle, and to take a large number of alcohols.
"Mans people like the aquavit more than the Rakfish," says Havard.
The spirit can devour the green.
I bought some heads.
If you disappear to bring the rackfish in the nearby, it's not bad - even like Sushi, which has a right long busy back.
Rakfisk is the product of a whole entire, which is most severe northern epoch when there is still no cold possibilities and the fish was limited in air-term waters.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after long fermentation and, in doubt, in the help of alcohol-depressed sins.
Ever before a generation, thousands of Norwegians seemed to search for work to leave their country and to turn into the United States.
Today, the population grows faster - more than 13% are involving, covered by a flowering work market, high lengths and an increasing health.
Even from Swedish, the old rivals, which had not been a longer longer richer than Norway, stream invaders.
Rakfisk is considered as something important - as a essential, even if there is a serious part of the Norwegian history.
He's the most severe judges that you can buy here.
But actually there's all weird - a little glass beer or a sandwich costs honorable 10 euros.
Norway doesn't make it often in the world press, and most people seem not to destroy it.
It still has to be called Andres Brevik in name - those rassist law extremeists, the last year 77 men, women and children.
Instead, you just refer to the "Affairs of 22 July".
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peace - loved country is able to kill such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for the today's riches of Norway is from the past 1970s the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industry of the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why it's so good for us," says Anna, our celler, who divides the round tablets with a rack fish, and with her long blown hair and the green blue eyes the north ideal.
We're a - as you say -- a transparency people.
Your English is exactly like the most people here makellos.
We're not very advertising, we don't like prayers.
Norway has passed very carefully with its oil rate - a large part of the branch contracts will be invested to future generations in a special fund.
As in the years to the World Economic Crisis, all with money that they don't seats, Norwegian maintained his money bodies.
"When we go in the winter Ski and walk in the room, we're happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, rakfisk eat," adds it with an unbelievable laugh.
I stand in the snow and set me up for another judgment - I have enough of Rakfisk.
So an elch burger is in any case something else.
But on the evening, it's back on the food plan.
The hotel where I am logging is one of the numbers of events that organize a rack fishing inner, with the guests for the best - or maybe the wedding room can vote on the strongest required - fishing.
There is a live-TV scale to a floating show master, which is covered by cellers with rackfish.
The spectacle is like Eurovision Song Contest.
"How many points do you have in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jurgen?"
"This is our points, Havard."
You're kidding and laughing.
A man falls from his throne, possibly overwhelmed by aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict darkness of the whole fish.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is before hard start
While the future President Enrique Pena Nieto was prepared for his officer, Will Grant analysed the future requirements of the BBC and the lost feelings of his people.
Currently the transport in Mexico City is very bad.
Even in better days, this is a constant hidden city, but on Monday, a ring was created from the stael, which locked several important transport routes into the main city and watchs the streets for Chaos.
However, the objective was not to destroy Pendlers on the way to work, but to demonstrate them to achieve the Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto will take the president's connections and take the leadership of the nation.
He's in the presence of a complex task.
In the distinctive government Felipe Calderons, the Mexico has been able to be able to be able to make good, but the country is in the front of a drug war which has been cut 60,000 people in the past six years.
"My Government is strong to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto beginning this week in Oval Office to the US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that we can get this goal.
Before he went up with the US President, Pena Nieto was a governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this nearly, a wide part of the country, which is around the main city, the opinions of the new State Government are shared.
A direct man
In the entire small town Valle del Bravo, you like to remember him, for example.
A resident of the landscape write to him the development of tourism and the building of the infrastructure.
To achieve the city, you can go to one of the car cars that made the Pena Nieto built and show a great improvement against the browns, helping streets that gave it once here.
Plakets with his name are also stretched outside a modern sport centre and an impressive interactive museum to climate change.
"We expect real and maintaining changes from him," his friend and political relationship Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as Congress Board for the Party Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, what affects security and economics, we hope for a interesting and real change that our country needs so strictly.
After 81 years, the PRI was deleted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress of the Congress, Olvera, suggests that the party has a great expectation in Enrique Pena Nieto for 12 years outside the President's past.
The proposals of the Opposition, the new President, are in the substance, declines.
He's a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He's a wonderful stateman, especially he's a person who can hear.
But on the other hand of the State, many people don't share this opinion about their previous government.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the planted streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The location is hidden under car car travel transmissions and is in many respects a city of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the communities are of an extreme urban nature.
In the beginning of this year, the military was enabled to fight drug bands operating in the fourth quarters, and violence against women is a particular accurate problem.
On a floor Brachland near a large muscle deponie was left only in the past two years the body of murdered women.
During the office time of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, a statistic, which even overcomes the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is concerned for their violence and murder for innocent women.
The critical Pena Nietos is the view that he has not approved the problem of women's murder during his office time.
However, in the worst case, his government closed their eyes before the problem.
In a beton built, typically for the fourth down, Irinea Buendia fights with the treasures when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of the events, afterward, began Mariana 2010 to kill himself.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her lives.
"When I came to her home, it seemed like if her body was weak," remembered Senora Buendia.
There was signs that she was struck, and the body stars had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, she looked down from the wall a picture of Mariana. It is brought near a cross, which is the only word: righteousness.
But exactly these, so the family, you've rejected her until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I am a switcher, unruhestifter, northerns.
You want to just accept her judgment and keep his mouth.
"But it is not possible if it has so many form errors and distractions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto accepts the chairman on Saturday, he also takes a great responsibility.
Decades of Mexican families have been moved to community in the past six years of violence, and the new President has promised to take care of this problem in particular during his office time.
"I hope that the President is as a Governor," says the PRI Congress Congress Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, exactly before the family of the victims were afraid of most of the ciudad Neza.
The State Administration said: Bradley Manning has not considered mistakes
The State Agency against Bradley Mannings proposals, he was missed in prison.
The audience is considered with manning time in military prisons in Quantico, Virginia
The defence requires a decline of the accommodation based on several conditions of depression.
The freedom of the US Army is proposed to use thousands of trusted documents
The State Agency has tried freely to determine that the army free Bradley Manning - approved for the greatest confidential information of the United States history - several opportunities to defense the military mistakes of him.
Maj. Ashden Fein explained that the documents for weekly visiting the offices of the prisoners in Quantico were adopted in Quantico, Virginia, during a preliminary audience.
One day before the cross audience, which, according to a request of defence for the defense of the accommodation - Manning was already attempted enough by the severe time of debt - Manning had said that in prison he had raised the Suicide.
The Secret Service Analysis of the United States Army arrested in June 2010 will be proposed during a thousand trusted documents in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the audience on Friday, Fein with Manning went through the forms that the officers after their meetings with Manning were fulfilled during his happy in Quantico Milliar prisons, where he had been fulfilled from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
As the enemy asked him on the free day to the forms, Manning said that he had judged the treatment through his watch as "excellent" and the treatment through the entire establishment as "normal professional".
The formers, such as fee, did not exhibit any statements about mistakes, although the employees were asked directly to treat his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his minds, and the officers would have spoken these with him and indicated to consider them, but they were not registered.
"It's written (after talking to the minds) "No problems" and that doesn't mean necessary that I've never said anything," so Manning.
The judge, the Supreme Denise Lind, also asked Manning, why he didn't discuss his treatment when he met a committee in January 2011, who had to investigate the Suicid thoughts mentioned in a formula.
Manning replied that his view during this meeting was made to leave his observation status to the "prevention of losses".
The military stated that it had given him this restrictive status - which is a level under self-security - to his and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince the workers that it was well, and to solve the monitoring state to prevent disasters (...) to get a higher quality of life from my view," said Manning.
Manning said on the Sunday to his arrest and release to Kuwait, where he was held next two months before he was released in the prison of the Marine Basis Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that he was in Kuwait to kill himself, and he became unbelievable because of the heat.
It was not able to know what happened to him or in the outside world.
"My world struck on the camp Arafjon, on this coffee together," said Manning on Sunday.
I thought I would die in this coffee.
When he was released after Quantico, Manning had cut the largest part of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You just allowed him a matratze, a deck, Flip flows, clothes and his brills.
Manning said he was trying to stay in movement, because on the day it was prohibited to sleep or even to sleep.
Stets had to sleep with light, which was outside in his cell.
When he turned around night and watches couldn't see his face anymore, he raised him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formal Antwerp against the treatment of Manings.
In April 2011, Manning was sent into the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked an accusation that he had taken in his office on Sunday - so he slept a night in his cell in Quantico and had to stay in a morning quote before watching and other prisoners.
Manning had said he never had the opportunity to fulfill his deck.
At the question on Friday, Manning said that he had closed from a command of his watch that he should leave the deck with which he could have covered himself, but he gave him that no one would ask him.
On Sunday, Manning said that he was offered to sleep in the past night, and he was trying to show a officer that he had no danger for himself.
Manning said to the officer he could use the contract of his subhose or its flows to lose himself, but it wasn't done.
In this night, Manning said that he was removed from his cell, Flip flows and brills.
His advice hopes that the judge will take care of his resources at least and reduce the shipment of his challenges, he should be judged in his negotiation before the military Court. This is set up for the beginning of the next year.
The defence has indicated that Manning will be considered smaller procedures for culpable, while other adjustment points that are considered as extremely extremely.
The continuation of the audience is set for this weekend, and the State Office is expected to be attempted.
The pentagon remains at its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions applied for all of the highest security reviews in Quantico.
To the adjoint points against Manning, the benefit of the enemy, illegal publication of secret services in the Internet, transmission of national defence information and public property or documents.
If he is found in all attachment points for sin, he has been a long-term challenge.
My Mexico-American identity crisis.
Many people are required to leave Mexico because of the missing chances.
Mexicans tried to accuse the extravagants - they call to them severe times in memory, he says
Navarrette is the view that Mexico Americans are captured between two worlds
On a recent road to Mexico City, I just just tried the hall and came to the pass control when I had a wide ratelessness in me.
The skins are listed to two waiting skins: one for "Mexican" and another for "Extranieros" ("outland").
I stayed there for a few seconds, uncertainly, to whom I should be assigned.
I'm grown up in Central California, and my whole life was called "Mixianer".
A ethnic cycle - exactly as my friends in Boston "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Afterward, I decided for "Mixian American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandwater's house there was no need for shortcuts or rings.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least enough to speak to me in this language at both ends of a interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a mother speaker, and my American accent will not even go away.
So I took my American travel pass and put me in the shoes for aliens.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the white house to meet President Obama.
At the agenda, all the subjects expected to meet the heads of these two countries: income, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for today to make mexicans with the same high probability in Mexico, instead of exploring in the United States.
He wants to communicate with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block according to the form of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swears to continue the Mexican war against drug cards, even if he had no details called this.
Mexican relationship with the United States is complicated and completed.
Most Americans, probably, have never lost a single thought that the United States affected in Mexico in 1848 and that the leadership of the country has been able to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for mexicans who don't think in the centuries and not in minutes are not to overview reminders of this event.
As soon as a US government officer is only the latter crisis in Mexico, you hear - in the Mexico Press and under the elites of the country - states about how the Americans describe the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Montezumas are on the street of war.
However, the greatest requirement of Mexico is in truth in relationship with more than 35 million Mexico Americans who live in the United States.
Is it pleased to talk about repeatments?
There's more than enough.
Mexican has winners and losers. People who offer the country's chances, and others who do not do this.
The only reason why many of the mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio lives in that a person in a point in our stamp - maybe a parents or grandparent part - has received no chance in Mexico and exposed north direction.
And in most cases, this person consists of a profile - dark, unbuilt, out of a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithful applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may live the American dream now, visiting good schools and getting good jobs, we can never lose from the eyes that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexico.
Our identity is sometimes perhaps disappeared, but what our loyalty affects is not the case.
This shall be applied to the United States.
In addition, we know that many members of the Mexican leadership are not worthy of.
This is the same thing.
They see us as a shooter of a depressive deadline and look at us down because we are not mexical enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands in Mexico will never be strong enough.
Their opinion is our existence is a symbol of the separator.
If our family wouldn't be successful in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see us now behind the Seiden's presence - with an acceptable life in the United States, but sometimes lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and became a child legal in the United States, remembers that between Mexico and Mexico American Spanishments exists because the Mexicos have a clear idea of who they are - and the Mexico Americans take them this bad.
While she is an American citizen, she is a part of two countries.
However, many mexical Americans, I know, have no feeling to belong to one or another country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del North, but also Bruce Springstein.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but no one is disgusted in it.
In Mexico we will be seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my travel, there is something that makes this relationship more complicated: some Mexico leaders and parts of the education citizens want to retract their connections to diaspora.
They want mexical Americans to use as provisorian "bodies" for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country is and pressing the political leadership to intensify their commitments to Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
A lot of painful feelings.
And in view of the unjust income distribution, the unexpected corruption and the drug officers, many of us are not so sure that it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you've got to go alone, friends.
That's true.
If at least some Mexiconers are still not ready to forgive the United States to meet Mexican for several hundreds ago, they also need to accept that some Mexico Americans have made a role for how their family members have been treated so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're "Mexican" as I thought.
Old fights, new near East
The weapons station between Israel and the Hamas could be made as unexpected basic pillars for peace
Can it ever give peace between the Arabians and the Jews in the nearest east?
The latest bloody events seem to achieve such hope in the Keim.
In the midst of ordinary offences, multiple buildings were set in protection and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, murdered most of the civilists, and six Israelites - and the first time rackets from Gaza were attached near the Israelic Metropole Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians appeared to be captured in their historical conflict, the nearest east changed around them.
The Arabic Birthday has created a new, unknown situation, and if they want or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these officers.
Maybe this will lead to more blood.
However, there are reasons for accepting that the dead patt situation could finally find its end.
A war that doesn't lose nor win
On the first view, Optimism seems to be attached to the current situation.
Even if the weapons attached on 21 November, the weapons have strengthened the weapons on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the islamist movement controlled by the Gaza Strength since 2007, will be considered that the Israelis had been rejected, although his group himself had to sign great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1,7 million inhabitants of the Gazastreif in one of the most desolated and nearly populated branches of the planet, Israel is not able to destroy the Hammas.
In fact, the Hamas in West Jordan, which is controlled by the rivaling, according to the Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the end that they have the time on their side.
So as the Islamists have won influence in the Arab world, the Hammas has powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a stronger, regional power, one of the most rich and dynamic golfs of Israel, has taken for Hammas party - exactly Katar, one of the most rich and dynamic golfs.
Young Hammas' additives believe that Israel is a Islamist Halbmond - from Libano in the north, where the military Hisbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels could stand before the struggling of Bashar Assads, until Jordan, where Hammas's relationships came to the king.
And in particular the increase of the Muslim brothership under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the most inhabitants and most important Arab countries, in the South Fland of Israel, has changed the equal growth of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lazistic despot, the Egyptians ruled for 30 years ago, had only a little time for the Hammas remaining.
In the same way, the brothership with the Hamas has been dismissed and its leaders are more stronger than peoples.
In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas may be considered as a factor that could not be exhausted from Israel and the United States.
The Israeli Hardliners have taken a conceived conclusion.
Militaryly seen has no danger anymore.
The Israeli Raketen Report system, "Iron Dome", has been able to conceal and many of the Hammas rackets have been destroyed.
At least a while, Israel will be quieter to sleep.
In diplomatic regards, the United States are increasingly set at their position, and many European countries have made the Hamas responsible for the most recent guarantees.
It has been well done in the past years, especially under the Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to large parts.
Although rackets from the Gaza streets have been killed since 2004 almost 30 Israelis, the country is relatively free of self-dead states - not recently thanks to the sperrands that are entered into West Jordan and thus in the main part of a Palestinian State. These protect the Jewish residences that were stated for the people's rights, but they will continue to be built.
Netanyahu is well. His Likud Party has linked his choice on 22 January under Avigdor Loverman with another other fighter group.
Why do these Palestinians also beat and leave them a own country?
If they actually had the control of the West Jordanland, wouldn't they cut out exactly as their assistants in the Gaza streets?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall in the shock, and to shoot them to have the heads.
Perhaps the hardliners may be able to continue, but the Arabic Fruit may make them a striking through the account.
Even if the Islamists who are now sitting in Egypt and in other countries have remained little for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defence of Israel is greater than his four neighbors together.
A war with the local superficial power will not help the new Arab governments in the situation of their economy.
That the Pragmatic President Mursi had joined with Barack Obama to get a weapon, could be a promising promising sign - and maybe symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Moreover, Israelis should think longer.
While the rest of the Arab world takes steps in the direction of democracy, Palestinians will continue to consider their self-decreasing rights - a poolface that will certainly explore a day in the Israelites areas, as well as this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
The impression is now submitted to the Democracy in the Jewish State, and with the growth of the Arab population will only have this situation.
Blood missions for the return of Hamas in Gaza streets are requested for their diplomatic tribut over the years.
Both pages require a extern accommodation
The right answer is the representative of the comprehensive representatives both sides, the largest part of the rest of the world and of this magazine: two States to which Israel has come to security areas.
The - for the near future small - hope is that the weapon stage provides more influences on the implementation of this solution.
The Egyptians must now stop the weapons in the Gaza streets together with Turkey and Katar, and it is better positioned than before, to convince the Hamas from the idea of a Jewish State based on the borders of 1967, fulfilled by the areas and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to a single unit.
This would be more for the design of a Palestinian State than with the existing request of UN monitoring status.
Obama also needs to help his part to move Israel to negotiations.
During his first office time, he deployed his own peace plan.
In the white house, it seems like he would like to decline a participation.
But this is a short, short perspective.
The United States have a significant interest in a stabil nearest east.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarettes packaging are in force
Health warnings and disease body parts of neutral green packages that are equal to all tabakmarks
The first laws for uniform cigarettes and tabak packages are in Australia in force. This will be replaced by neutral, olive green deck that are printed out with drastical images, which are broken body parts and showed by the cigarettes' diseases and children.
From the various health warnings and images, the next week of the only difference between the packages in the mark names that are printed in identical, small fonts.
This brings Australia into the world the most strengest rules for tabak packages.
The Australian Agreement Government will take young people out of the smoke by exploring the glamorous image of the tabak consumption.
The Government of studies show that people who have not yet started with 26 will not be started with 99 per cent of probability.
"Man can already see young children that they understand the message to fight the tabak concerts with their mark image," so, Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. They quoted studies that showed, for example, that children associate the crowns of a logos with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia shows one of the less rare costs of the world, and the changes only affect the winning of multinational concerts, other countries have already considered similar steps.
The Tabaklobby fighted hard against the laws.
So it said that with the laws, the black market trade would be favorable to explore and easier accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unobserved consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
China and Indonesian Flanders are now offered by larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others say that the laws have committed their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand of Zigaretnettuis and Silikondells is greatly affected to deteriorate immediate packages since the British American Tobacco concerts, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco, two months ago, at the highest Australian court of the laws.
Zico sold up to 6000 units in large trade business and waited for new conditions.
That's a good business for us.
Experts followed the fakes in the liberty of social media at exactly the population group that is addressed by the plan.
A number of Australian laws have disappeared tabak concerts from the TV work, it is understood them as sportsponsors, and most handmaids have been able to cut off cigarettes in business. Now the tabaccowering is changed to the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited the Internet through local companies and pages, but there is no influence on international sites.
"When Tabak markets and has only a small area to build its products, it doesn't go through the Internet," says Becky Freeman, researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman defined a growth of experience reports to marks that were designed by "ganz normal people".
You need to ask the question: Is this only a private person that finds so much pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that it also takes a video - or has a Marketing Agency to do that?
The British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focused on marking in order to interact with the new laws.
It has even been so long to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic to adopt new rules - these countries are concerned with the World Trade Organization on unrestricted trade restrictions, although there is no greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for the middle of 2013.
Following Plibersek, the Government has conducted conversations with other countries that have considered similar packages.
Canadian was the first country for which the photographic warnings were written in 2001.
These were extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More laws are raised in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves pleasure.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"Man just takes a kippe and stops the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a cygaret box, on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Really, there's just one reason why I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, manufacturer of the tabak trade "King of the Package" in the inner city of Sydney, says that the uniform package has cut off its rules.
"Therefore I needed a hour ago to order a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The Government should just provoke cigarettes completely -- then we would have said good that it was, we're gonna be silent," he added.
In a permanent electricized world, it's nice to be likely to be
This thanksgiving was inexpected five hours in the airport when our aircraft was exposed because of mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had enough time to make me a few thoughts on long.
I don't want to lie.
A half day in the airport is very nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones are available (and, of course, free shopping).
But more academic and children developing experts do long-terms than something positive.
If it goes after them, it's for us - and our children - okay, at times to be weak.
This is the need to lose the brain in interesting thoughts, which may enhance creativity.
And because most of us today are almost staring on one or another screen, we will not benefit from the preliminary costs of the long-term.
So, should we welcome the long way with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
Then I'll come back again.
How many people I also have declared that the long-term phenomenon is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with more freedom.
But Peter Toohey, Professor for Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that.
"In fact, the long-term has a very long story," he says.
The household Pompejis is a latin graffiti on long-term, which returns to the first century.
And then there is still the question of how we definite a long-term.
John D. Eastwood, a associated professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, is the problem in which long-term species have been defined and discussed.
After long reading of research literature and the presentation of the ideas before a focus group of about 100 people came to Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to conclude that long-term experience would be "a pleasant activity, but it is not possible."
At long time, Apathie is different from the following that the person is not busy, but it wants to be.
At the Apathie, you don't give a ransom to do something.
The key experience of the long-term, he says, in a "a threat of the attention process, compared with bad launch and feeling that the time is just quickly forgetting."
A long time you can feel like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two circumstances could be related, the worthy persons see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are long, even if we have only difficulties to concentrate.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention" - to Germany: "The unfortunate understanding: the definition of long-terms under the aspect of the attention," which appeared in September "Perspectives on psychological science", the Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to a previous experience to hear the participant of a band, on which a person has a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the inhabited room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at lower volume, so that it wasn't really true, while the third group had not taken this room.
The persons who had not heard the audible TV had given them more longer than the two other groups -- they had problems to concentrate themselves, they could not find a reason for this, and write their difficulties in the long-term.
If you are trying to concentrate on a hard or striving task, the disturbation of the attention to long-term, Mark J. Fenske, associated professor for neurologists at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If you get a unique activity - "as such as searching for false products on a manufacturer, you can remove music and help to feel unbelievable."
In fact, he says, we now know that heroic cells and crisis, often, as signs for long-term, they can fight even by staying carefully.
"Studios have shown that children who can learn more and maintain more information than those who are urgent to quietly," says Professor Fenske.
All of us will be once long-term - my traveling air, a dramatic sound speaker, especially an embarrassing film.
But some people are easier than others.
In order to measure this difference, researchers developed in the 1980s a "Scale to long-wide capacity".
At the scale there are words like "More things I have to do, repeat and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I have no longer time for everything."
With such scales, researchers have found that the boys will be longer as girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, Professor for psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially the need for more and a larger external reiz.
But in general, the teenagers are a very exciting holes.
In 1991 Reed Larson, Professor for Human and Common Development on the University of Illinois, carried out an experience by which he had been contacted about about 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times on day.
He found that 32% of the adults in school and at the age of households were worthless of 23% if they were not in school.
However, only 3% of the parents had to feel weird.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know whether the percentages are increased or sad.
However, he is sure that "the young one will be especially long-termly influenced," mainly because children and teenagers have no great influence on their entire room.
So Back to my original question: Is it healthy?
Sometimes it does not, because in extreme cases it makes people to take extreme corporate risks and lose the luxury game or drugs to lead them - that has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophy and authors are studying the relationship between long-wide and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who studied the subject since more than two decades.
"A long time the brain wants to say that you should do something else," so Gary Marcus, Professor for psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do.
If a long-term and use this energy to play and buy Gitarre, you will be happy.
However, the television may be shortly concerned for happiness, but they are long-term, but again.
So whoever has a iPad of his desired child is sufficient, it can take it from the long way, but it has not learned to talk or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "A self-control is overridden by a situation to the other."
The child is not only learning to discuss himself, but also gets more self-controlled in other areas.
I don't think we should lie long.
We shouldn't see them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be able to be able to be able to enjoy the permanent activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood is right.
"It sounds like that we should have been lately, but long-term is the cold, unbelievable desire to do something sensitive," he says.
He believes that people are in truth only looking for one way, cut off, and disappointing themselves.
"In a environment where we are constantly superstituted, it is difficult to build if the dream is one of us."
In Colorado there is no clear guidance for the new Marihuanage set
The 19-year-year Community College Student and Football Games Anthony Orosco is in the Southern Colorado for a court procedure that will now be legal in this state: the possession of some few Marihuanabrooks and a peep with which he cut these.
Orosco followed him and some friends on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border in Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police agent Marihuana was found in the car, Orosco was carried out for the possession of drugs and drugs in the car - qualities of qualifications, which have been confronted with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court term.
"We'll be treated as criminals," says Orosco.
But he's also one?
In the unknown weeks after the decision of the State, the response to hundreds of smaller drugs is less than from the location.
Third hundreds of orders that turn around Marihuana will have already fallen here and in the state of Washington, which has accepted similar measures.
The police authorities persecute adults over 21 years not longer for possession in smaller ways; this is legally arrested when the new laws are in force in the next weeks.
But the state officers in the conservative offices of Colorados have announced to continue existing marihuanadelicities and still cited people before the Court.
At the same time, several cities have been raised from the provinces of Denvers to the West Mountains to reject new, public licensed Marihuana businesses in opening in their congregations.
"This situation is so quickly developed that I don't know what will happen as the next," says Daniel J. Oates, police officer in Aurora, the east of Denver.
And also regulatory authorities in the United States of Washington are ratless on the head.
They wait for an orientation assistance to establish a licence system for the production, the production, the distribution and the sale of drugs - and have a period before 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is considered that Colorado is in every case the most States in respect of the regulation of Marihuana, where the drugs were only legalized to medical purposes and then to own consumption.
"Colorado has a stronger regulated market. The State is therefore good to the orientation," says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the supervisory authorities in Washington.
But Smith also means that no place or system can do more than serve in the meaning of a green leadership.
"We have no real prevention that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, named I-502, is in force on 6 December, and also makes the end point of a grauzone where the State license system is not yet existed, but the possession is legalized.
And inappropriate practices must be concluded in this time - even as the state standard of a "acceptable access" Marihuana licensed with the prohibition of Cannabis employees within 300 meters around schools, parks, games, and children's offices.
"Nowhere it will be difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in town areas, especially in the balling area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, speaker for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently educated research group.
On 21 November, the Chief Oates sent his collaborators to Aurora a mail in which he declared that the State Office would not persecute the smaller marihuana identity with persons over 21 years, and that the police would not be tried to be punished for these procedures.
Boss Oates added that the police continued to continue citizen advantages to regulate medical marihuana buildings and would continue to persecute drugs.
In Weld County in North Colorado, Ken Buck has made a stricter view.
After the vote, he said that his authority would continue to persecution the cases of Marihuanabezitz, mainly to move consumption.
Currently, 119 persons must be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less Marihuana before the Court, although many were also attached to other delicts.
"Our authority has the obligation to persecute losses in which it had been done at the fact-time of crimes," the Buck declared in a statement.
Reactions are also in locations such as the country Messa County, where the choices refused the Marihuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the country cross, shows adults for the possession of smaller quantities not longer.
The Officer Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but it also decided to fall not all outstanding field procedures.
"I don't think I'm disappearing my time to transform the right until it's changed."
Although 55% of the choices in Colorado supported the measure, it was already clear that it would not be easy to join the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexibilities of government and law systems.
And the contradictional reactions in the entire state promoted a deep-gravity column in view of the great green experience at day.
It is a "culture barrier", says Sean McAllister, a law lawman of Denver, who is raised for the Marihuanadelity of the Court and acts for the National Organization for Reform of Marihuanage.
"They have made a large part of their life in order to persecute persons guilty that they can still not accept legalization," he believed.
As the first states that treat the smaller numbers of Marihuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington will be treated as national treatment cases for the legalization of drugs.
While preachers and state officers were prepared for a timely legal selling, they also expected nervously to the mandates of the Agreement Government, which would continue to treat the sale and built of Marihuana on the contract levels.
The President of the Legislation Movement hopes that the Ministry of Justice will be submitted.
However, several surveys of consumption and vendors of the Medical Marihuanas, the Agreement Government has made the sale of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries.
Kevin A. Sabet, previous drug policyberators of Obama Government is the view that the criminal employees may not be entered in order to consider smaller numbers of drugs, but it may be likely to strive to regulate political businesses under the new legislation.
Many cities in Colorado expected not only that the contract authorities act.
In addition before the election day, some local community administrations of Moratory for new Marihuana businesses were accepted, although they could only open for a year.
Last week, Montrose decided, a city in the West, a six-monatic contract that probably is agreed next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we license someone and then stand on a big problem," says Bob Nicholson, member of the town Council.
Our community has voted against this legislation.
We are judged after what the Community has decided and not after what the State has decided.
There are still many questions open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was getting out of Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students from today are attacked for their views
Almost always was my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Although my father and my elder brother visited the university that I only held for the world's greatest knowledge temperature, for a modern Greek symposy, which helped the large columns of civilization - free thoughts and tolerance -.
However, within two weeks after my income in the Worcester College End of the eighth years - there I had proposed to study history - I had packed my coffee back and then brought the first scandal of my life.
My dad fell together in dreams.
My friends were hungry.
In Evening Standard it said I would have gone because I had a problem that the Commilions had sex in the visited room.
The author A N Wilson explained that I would have left the university because I had to drink of painful taxes.
But the truth was less attractive.
I left.
Yeah, well, because I've been a little under systematic mobing and drugs.
Not even because of my right unlike name, or because I came from a private school.
I was just scanning for a reason - a reason that seemed in this range of lighting about so low and grass: My middle of dead father Woodrow Wyatt was an important advice of Margaret Thatchers and I was the Conservative Party's Conservative.
Why do I say this now?
Now, the present reports follow a new generation of students of the appropriate rights under similar persecution.
The organized and increased hass at Tory Students in Oxford has developed in the middle of such sizes that a group of them requested the same equation protection, to accommodation, reaching and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College, they will be "oft actively isolated, personally attacked and explained for unexpected."
They request a place in the Equality Committee of their colleagues to ensure that their opinions may be freely expressed.
Her situation was scared by a recently exposed documentation of political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the tours were represented as an excentrical and neonazis.
It was shown in the other part of Absolvent Joe Cooke, the previous president of the conservative student agreement of the University of Oxford, who went in a roll Royce, and served with silver colouring and silver behavior.
In other universities, the conservative students say that they will be considered as "Saturday cups for the introduction of higher studies".
The 20-year-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Students Unit of the University of Nottingham, left in a Sunday period: "There is a growing link tendency in universities.
The people believe we are like the Bullingdon Club, without being learned to meet us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and historical students in Corpus Christi, who started the search for greater protection, is the view that such climate is "inappropriate". The 19-year-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designed President of the conservative student agreement of Oxford, said that she had observed a growing advice against students of the respective rights.
"This is a danger for the intellectual discussion and the welfare of the members," she says.
In my first week in Oxford, I was a smaller.
As an incredible 18-year-old, I was in September 1986.
The Hass on the Conservative Party had its height point.
In the past year, the university had voted for Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of curses in high school.
The atmosphere would even be scared of stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when the new students learned themselves and the Tutors, I received a suggestion on the future story.
I made the experience that the Tutors did not only duplicate the performance of Tory students, but even with joy.
Political subjects such as the mountain worker streek, the privacy and the adoption of the Government of Sanctions against the South African region found their ways in the wooden rooms of the Tutorium.
In the first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century to English, and I was not aware of what I should do.
"Ms. Wyatt," said the Tutor Harry Pitt (for a while died), "come translate the first paragraph."
I stole it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like a cook, and very heavy.
"Don't you refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students kicked.
In my eyes, the dreams were shut up.
"I suggest they take a few French hours in your free time - so if you're not very busy with your social activities," Pitt urged me.
I turned back in my room with a smoking head.
In this evening, I was sitting in college alone on the evening when someone lying on the shoes.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who was a member of the conservative student agreement.
"I know who you are," he said pleasantly.
I'm sorry it's how it is.
Everyone who is disappointed to be Tory will be threatened.
It's too bad for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is near, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most of the Tory Prime Ministers propose to be the members of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to make me later.
I found that I was not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher a opinion.
This trick should be successful.
A study beginner in the philosophy, political and economy, which is ironically visiting Eton College as conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fashistic wine."
You're mistaken.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and crazy.
"Who have Tories Sex?" asked me one.
They're in contrast, isn't it?
I felt like Homosexual had to feel before the liberal legislation of the United States.
Would you like me to lead a normal life to Oxford University?
Can I just see the same age after the income of the darkness?
Do I have to use the Labour Party and submit my natural neighbors?
The three years that stood before me, they turned up before my spiritual eye to a fire of emotion and isolation.
The only Tutor who was open to recognize himself as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of time Genesis history who had his seat in my college.
He was not only happy to be a conservator, but also because he considered the Tatcher in the business of external policy and wrote for them.
He was just early in there.
He hated the place, found him provincial and small carried, and declined him for his marristic deterministic storyspective.
1997 he took a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to pendle between Oxford and my parents' house and found a fight with closed friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hate Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the fourth century, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said, "but it's the best place in the world."
So they would never do anything, not in my city of the dreaming tours.
Even my communist friends have set free manners on the day.
His smoke eyes were thirsty.
Give the whole chance.
I'm sure you're just taking you.
It would break my heart if you go.
The creation of my frequency roads to London has been a hard resistance.
One of my husband's friends, even Tory's Attachment, had been able to press and convince his confidences.
During a Tutorium in the next week, when another story student was seriously said I was a "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was in secret before hungry, I gave my parents to understood me a "the brain hair" and called them "the old trottel."
The reliance was just shortly attempted.
It was my father who killed the last nail in the shirt of my Oxford carriers.
At that time he wrote two columns for week in the Murdoch Press.
My door was closed.
I hid me in my room, and after five minutes my hair was opened.
When they went, I packed a coffee and took the first track to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a wine shop.
But no 18-year-old should ever be painted in a educational institution under such a surprise and badness.
And more tragedy is that Oxford was - a university who was not only 14 Tory Prime Minister, but has hidden a unvaluable call of equal rights and freedom.
"Valentino's elegance is forward"
According to the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which has been opened this week in London, ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thysen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian modemachers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I from England, is the only place in the British capital city, which is worthy of maintaining a statement on Valentino Garavani.
This has recognised the Designer in the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a great retrospective for more than 130 clothes of the high court, which were created by his "Maison" in the past 50 years.
"I love this Palast," he says with his unchangeable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protogonist "il Mr" is Garavani, but without his different clients could not be written.
Valentino has always spent fascination for the fast and remote world of the Adels.
In the first chair of this exhibition, which will be seen until 3 March, there is a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the first aristocracy, beginning by Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Mary-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal reminders as the trophes of his social growth from the specific modems in the city of Voghera in North Italia to the idea of the international Jetset.
In the Adel, you don't have to be a party.
"Instead, they didn't take their kits on your beautiful teppich, as it's doing some beautiful shoes from the Pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thysen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, both lived in the alpen and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, great and elegant guest.
"We all enjoy when we were invited to his house to Gstaad," explains the exclamation of "Heini" Thyssen, a joyful with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugene Niarchos.
Valentino has already proposed the elegance of the humbleness.
And then he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a clothe of Valentino
The argentin model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charism of the moderator.
A few years ago, we went to him home to evening in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music recognized and felt his influence.
"All invitations felt important and loved," remembers the "Top-Model", which started their airports at the week of the Hotte Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of the mode because his designs are artworks," she says finally.
View of the origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of consciousness, even of contrast loves.
He loves people with good relationship and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was converted to a gloria and 60 meters long steel, which suggests a role steel: the user takes the place of the model and goes away to wonder a dreaming "Audience" that makes the master works of Valentino, such as the cloud, Jackie Kennedy for their age with Aristoles Yussis, chose the cosme, the Monica Vitti in "Late Notes", or a mantel out of Wolf and Leader of the Caseinnah Farbai.
In this public of model pups, the names like Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxi, Mette Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modem Machine, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "inconscious."
I can remember perfectly.
It was a hole, a hot, a western type "Gillette" and a Jack out of the herbst/Winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift of him," said Naty Abascal, one of the museum of the Designer.
"I take him all the others because of his great love for women and because he has highlighted our beauty," adds the ex-herzogin of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have many lights and subtracts the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinions in the mode Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time when she brought a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed to have the age and the opportunity to take one of his last clothes...
At the end of the 90s, it came finally to it.
I bought my first Valentino clothing for a feast in the close of my father, the prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red cloth with flying rock and a drained overseer with a decollete that makes his name honor.
"It was a real dream," says the Witwe of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino doesn't disappear from the mode, his beauty is untimed," explains this Italian aristocratic that lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Prinses D'Arenberg keeps their night clothes of the moderator "with an absolute sorgfalt" because a cloth is not only a clothing, but also the remembrances that are connected to it.
The "King" of the mode
The big final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding clothing of Marie-Chantal Miller for their age with Paul de Grecia in 1995.
Four months work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the modem called his neighbors) were necessary to offer this eleven-colored seed clothing with perlen, 12 different steckers and a fourth half meters long.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the Supreme Authority of the Fachpresse, this garment was a milkstein in the high couture end of the 20th century, "the return to the clients of the highest society."
For years, with the "saver-se" of Elite, Valentino is now her best exemplary.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest exhibition of Italian), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre of the Art and of the Lettres, expressed with the Ehrenlegion, sumulated Garavani so many honors, as well as every husband of his customers.
"My is always his raffination, his rest, his fulfilled and perfect outside," says D'Arenberg.
I've seen him last time on a month ago in a gala-cover in the museum de Orsay.
He sat on the table of the green Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was makellos; the time left no shoes on him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult employment of the world: the human workers of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the travelers of the Indian Vulcans have their lives and their health on the game when they take 70 kilo smokes over the rocks, stone paths.
There are people for which their work is hell, and others work seriously in hell.
This is the case of Antowijaya, one of the 400 min workers who relied their life by bringing the weight from the Vulkan Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indian Island Java.
That is why he needs to go down every day down to the ground of his cratter, where the gas steeled out of the earth in contact with the air.
After he broke a large steel stone, which can totally belong to 70 kilos, he carried them into two bamboo bottles on his shoes over the smooth paths from stone.
There are only 250 meters to the bottom of the Vulcan, which are up to a height of 2386 meters, but the created travelers need more than 40 minutes to increase in the sky curtain time, where they keep the equal growth and should be careful to not exhaust and abstract.
You know that every step can cost their life, as this happened a French tourist, which was abstracted in the steel sides of the Cawa Ijen for years ago.
My workers of Kawah Ijen are 5 eurocents for each kilo supply that they built.
On the top, they confront the way between the tourists who have photographed them as circles and run with the severe gravity cords three kilometers to the wage, which a min society has set a little more low on a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which uses the agreements in Volcan since 1960 and (not better said) its workers, which pays 662 indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo suffice.
This then sells for 10,000 rupias (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemic industry, because this mineral is widely wide in the day and is used for the production of striking oilers, firework articles, cosmetic, dinamic and even for sugar.
"When we usually take 70 kg, we get about about 46,000 Rupias (3,8 euros) for each way, Anto explains us that in normal case makes three streets day.
For each stream, he needs three hours in which he has completely succeeded, but on the end of the day he took 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros).
What is like a misherable reward for such a serious inhuman effort, but it is the triple of what he would pay with the field work.
"The day-to-day of the mine workers here, where 15,000 rupees are paid in the coffee (1,2 euro) on the day and the average month income is two million rupees (167 Euro), is very high," states the traveller who worked as a murder on the Turist Balli Island.
There he rewarded 75,000 Rupias (6,2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and the reason that in Indonesia is so important as the smoke: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hinduists, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, attempt with difficulty, freaks, and his eyes are cursed because of the future gas.
The 27-year-old Anto set his life on the game in Kawah Ijen since three years, whose smoke has already left the first shoes at him, although he covered his face with a mask and special bridge.
Anto has asthma, attempt with difficulty, freaks, and his eyes are out of the future gas from the Vulcan.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two years because I want to open a laptop or learn Spanish or French," he promised in one more than only acceptable English.
This sympatic and intelligent, but a young man who has been struck from life could work as tourist leader, Kellner or received a hotel, but instead he works the work of a tragedy.
He shares a painful tree tent with other trainers, and every morning opens two hours, because the smoke also smokes night, where his characteristic yellow color in darkness.
The shadows are required, he stirs up in the light of a small stress lamp at his helm which he buyed from his own money, in the crater.
At least 400 trailers launched the crowd with smooth on their shoes.
Instead of their great wine, the Mineral society has not mechanismed the sugar board to save costs, and provides the travellers who work on their own account and are paid by weight, no exploitation.
They also have no part of the 30,000 rupias (2,5 euros) Account for photo devices that guarders of this natural park together with the income payment of 15,000 rupias (1,2 euro) require from the tourists to photograph the Vulcan and the human trace.
"This work is for animals and not for humans" protested Madrusin, a greater, 42 years old traveler who works since the school is left in Kawah Ijen.
He's in the position to take up to 110 kg and ensure that he continues to "once it's going," because he needs the money for the growing of his three children in the age between 10 and 18 years.
I'm not gonna go to the renew, I'm gonna die here because the Vulcan was my whole life.
Even if the skin burns the hair and smokes the eyes, when the wind rounds smoothly and the mine workers in the white pillars that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that nobody smoke over severe diseases ... of course, except the normal attempts, arthrose, pains in the necks and branches on the skins that have made themselves from the weight of the core.
With the corb on his back, Uninik with his 53 years is at least at least 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions are broken 15 tons of smoke from the Vulkan, which are transported by three LKWs through a port between the ship to the ship in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going in the rent, I'm gonna die here because the volcan was my whole life," explains Oneinik, when he opens his mouth along where some deals missing.
Since his five children, the elder works with his 30 years as a smooth traveler.
The time is forgotten, but the army is generation in one of the worst calls of the world: those who work as human last in Kawah Ijen.
Singapur needs babys to save the economy
Singapurs shoot the crime that they have no children, the carriers, the stress and the costs of immobilities and the children's relationship.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic marriage: we will fill our citizens' obligation and create life!
It seems incredible that the versions are part of a publication for Minzbons, but then - or just why - they began this year in Singapore to a virtual video on YouTube.
The aspects are part of a rapper song, the local speech, such as "shirts" will be a "bao" (Laib) in the fields to make pleasure about the low birthrate in Singapur.
The BBH, who turned the video, is true the hope that the universe has been achieved in a funny way and way to take care of the problem.
Your creative Leader Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fill their "national obligation".
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and fun.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worstest of the world in the former planning, so we noticed that it's a subject that we need to worry about.
We knew that the Government had been trying many, such as the marketing of parfum with pheromons or the organization of speed-dataing facilities (speed floors).
It may be that many of these ideas were creative, but they didn't lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something so creative as possible to make this problem, such as compose a rape?
1,2 children.
He who doesn't take this subject easily is the Government of Singapore.
Every year, it is $1.300 for political measures to achieve the citizens to get more children.
A package of the Government for marriage and parents offers up to $15,000 per child, extends the maternity price and distributes strong prices.
But everything had little success.
Singapur is a rich, high-chnology city state in South Asia, which is also known for the conservation of his governors and its strict social controls.
According to his national population authority, the birthrate is currently for 1,2 children per female.
The last time, when this Council arrived over 2 - that was known as a replacement ratio - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapurs get children anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of the National Population Authority, says that it is to return to a "better education" and "creasing carrier changes".
"This has allowed people to be married and to make a family more options in relation to life goals and to set priorities," explains.
These amendments in social circumstances have contributed to a higher number of residents and to the inners of the marriage and births, which results of the reduction of the birthrate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an innovation policy, which has decreased a drastical growth of the adventure, to enhance the reduction of the population to resistance in the local population.
In Singapur there are websites where the nearly scattered Xenophobia smokes against many new adventures, especially against the Chineses who are criticized to keep the leafs down and not integrate themselves.
The growth of the immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that the government party in Singapur has received its bad choice results since the independentness.
Since the election was a trial to correct the problem with higher contributions and payments for external workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth ratio has known effects on the economic growth of a nation, the taxes, the health costs and the introduction policy, Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The Government tries to achieve that no lot of small rooms will be built.
So she has already influenced on the apartment market.
The citizen development authority began to control the number of small apartments that are known as "shots" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an apartment of 46 square meters and show a great sequence of sale.
However, the concern is that they can promote the lifestyle of the only ones, and that they fear the building companies of it to build a large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of Immobiliar Company EL Developers, says that his "show shoes" is very faster than greater residence units.
They're so popular, and the units are on day and even weeks to sell faster than the larger home units.
This causes them to be very better for our Cash Flow.
However, the new standards give the developers clear guidelines which were previously attached to the way if they want to build too many small residences within a project.
Too much stress
Singapur is a city.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way to increase the national birthrate, the conversation with the Singapurians who work in the financial quarter is to decide that they have no great effect.
"The people are strongly threatened, the rooms and the rooms are too weak, why it will be cut off from many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"To me it's important to have my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old man.
Mans and women bring their carriers, stresses, and costs for property and relief as a reason that they can not have children.
Therefore, the Singapurians have the last word when it is going to get children - the government can still do so much.
The offline Private offline is online private
Private sphére
According to the dictionary, it seems to be the property of private or "the area of private life where you have responsibility to protection in any kind of enemy."
What is privacy for someone under 16 years?
How will this definition be applied to its all-day and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he's raised if he knows in Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periodico interviewed five young people in the age between 10 and 15 years, often in the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term with "this very own" to personal level and "to password and user" when they apply it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets I would not know in a mail," says the 10 years old Jorge when trying to explain the meaning of "private" in web sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messager, where he has two years ago available on accounts.
"These are very confident secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I loaded beautiful images or images of games high.
I'm going to get my time to know.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't from me, or from someone who makes the dumphead," he said.
The young man is aware that it's wrong to write obscurous photos, of nackets, to publish crimes, or to write pregnant or violent comments.
Jorge ensures to meet 35 friends that he has in the FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most are adults.
In addition, the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I sent me to Twitter to express me and write interesting twitters.
"I don't know if someone answers me, I'm just loading it up," he adds.
"The social networks are soft, I can talk quickly with friends in the remote or friends."
He asks that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommends him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year Joseph is different.
The Teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he offers to not know 20 of the people he added his friends list.
"It's not scared because we have something common, for example, music," he says.
After the boy's introduction, no one has made him any advertising or asked him after his address or phone number.
"If someone threatens me or asks her from me, I just remove him from my user account" he adds.
Joseph talked to the question after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
The boys are unknown experiences that you know today as Cyberbullying.
The knowledge of a friend was pressed in a social network.
They threw him and asked money.
"He never knew who it was," he confirmed.
According to Joseph, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
Then he explains a number of steps to configure a user account safe.
In the difference in Jorge, these young photos of knowledge would be loaded in unrecognised or painful situations.
Yeah, I would do that if he's unimpathical to me or I want to get out of him.
"But I know that this is Cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Question
Marielos Porras, teacher for English with high school conclusions in education and teaching, means that to orientate children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet is a media to search for information, but with the appearance of these pages the game rules have changed," says she.
Porras explains that the Academic Marc Prensky, container of a Master Titles in Pedagogic University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital nationals are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital inhabitants to teach them where we still learn."
He explains that it's a complex theme, "cause we want them to have a definite criteria on what they browse, publish or say, and this is in a age where the reif is not sufficient for that."
"They should also be electronic if it is the most important to be pleased to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," adds he.
According to the famous man, it is the most effective way to learn to children and young people what is privacy to make them questions that brings them to think.
"Sure to say they shouldn't do it, it doesn't work," he said.
Porras then calls some opportunities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you then do it in the Internet?
Or: Would it please you if you publish a photo from you, like that you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others will publish about you?
Did you ask the other people to allow if you labeled photos of feeding?
And another question: should everyone know what you're doing in every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"It is a person outside of the Internet with respect, situation and other principles, and the same needs to apply for social networks," he explains.
Observation
Stuardo Guardia, University Professor, basic trainers and raisers, comments that it is incompatible that parents consider carefully the directives of social networks.
When they understand all sections, they are available on solid basiss to talk to their children about the meaning of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish."
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lecture "You don't have to talk to strangers."
Implementation of the insurance of the insurance without publication of Lima's declaration
The 6th meeting of the Presidents of the South America (Unasur), today, without a publication of Lima's statement, which was announced before and theoretically signed by the seven existing governors.
Efe tried to reach access to the document signed at the VI. Order meeting of the State and Government Leaders of the Unsur. Sources in the State and President's capacity were initiated to deliver it after the Clausur, but they declared that it would have been published for a certain time on the peruan government website.
In questions on the text, they said that the contents of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, were submitted to the price in short statements.
The access of journalists for information on the field was limited to every time.
During the day, only the image of the President's challenge was transferred in the pressure with the "private session, limited audio" message.
The few information circled under the journalists were received by the pressing challenges, some of the governments of unsur, but not from the peruan pressor.
The only document that was extended during the day was the list of the parties Presidents, which were offered to the centuries of journalists of various national and international media, which requested more information.
Afterward, the President of Peru sent me to media a mail with the "exclusive statement" of the philosopher, but it was done for the statement of Humalia, and not for the official document for the conclusion of the grief.
In the past October, Peru Gastger of the III. Gipfels of South America - Arab States (ASPA) was also published in this opportunity, although the price had mentioned the statement of Lima, which was previously published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you may be sure that the document was published in the past service.
At two international meetings, the Peruan authorities claimed that the information systems were available for journalists, but they restricted the access to information in a high way.
It also concluded with the common obligation of Chile and Peru to adopt a judge of the Court of Justice of the Haag, which contributes to a border conflict between two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, seemed to be achieved during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would adopt the decision of the IGH, which begins in the Moonday in the Haag, in the process, the Lima against Santiago, to hear both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we now bring this International Court," Humala said to his chinese.
"Chile was, and remains still a country that seeks peaceful solutions for combating, agreements closed and undertakes the international courts," adds Pinerra, and healed Humala with a hand pressure before both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they would have submitted to the IGH, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua, which had made it for a serious error, had made a question against the Agreement of Bogota, in which it agreed to submit the courts of this International Court.
The President of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the unsured President Fernando Lugo since 2011, has not participated in the meeting.
The hosting president Ollanta Humala opened the conversation on the former day and finished the field shortly after the middle time in Lima.
The State headquarters reported that 16 decisions were adopted and the action lines for 31 projects between the South American countries were established for a total of 17 billion dollars.
He said to the decisions concerned that the countries of uncertains "the significant steps in the direction of a south-American citizenship will be undertaken by the decisions on residential rights."
He shared that measures would be pre-profit to improve the cooperation in combating insurance in the cities and the organizated, override crimes, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and Internet to lower prices in all South America and to act together and effectively in the case of natural catastrophes."
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) does not take triumphing shifts, but should be served to expand our production rate and to show our people a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to provide a number of 31 emblematic projects to improve room connections in South America, especially in rural and border areas... and therefore our countries are joined and accepted new economic forms," said the Peruan President in a clear statement.
In these projects there would be also five peruans that lead to the crowns of his villages from the town to Brazil, and what two should be concerned for a better connection with Ecuador, although he had no more details.
It also took the final document related to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country is served for its re-reaction in the south-American nations" from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America continued to remain an integrated region for welfare and peace and with good sustainable relations was another aspect that was mentioned on the field.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before the beginning of his participation at the regional meeting, that he was a meeting in Mexico on the Sabbath day in Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, expected to treat the maritime conflict after a Bogota jurisdiction in question.
"I may be meeting to the President Daniel Ortega on the morning (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will check all these ways - they are not exclusively, and the Agreement also makes Nicaragua talks necessary with Nicaragua."
"I hope to say to the President Ortega that we will be civilized and respected as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they had the view, to be at the office of the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the section, the Ministry of Defence of the Block was also intended to enhance the action plan for the year 2013, in which the dialogue and consensus should be strengthened in relation to the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America has to learn in the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the design of a common citizenship is a goal to "South America really can learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the Presidents of the South America (Unasur) in the sixth field of the European Union, explained to the State TV in Peru that the Europeans "the second world war and in other distractions" and "the day practically are a fatherland."
In this regard, he defends the project to create a South American citizenship that prevents the Member States of unsur.
"The free transport of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as it is already in the Community of the case; yet there are still reactions sectors that try to return to the past," he warned.
The President Ecuador also encouraging the re-organization of the United States (OEA) under the standard to reduce the influence of the Angle Saxon States and to consider those who signed the Agreement of San José on Human Rights.
Those who teach, never commit to anything, and we sign the South Americans all things.
"It's not sure that the inter-American Commission for Human Rights has financed its seat in Washington and will be financed by the United States," he explained as a playing on the political asylum, the Ecuador has provided the Greece of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa entrusted that he didn't consider this decision because he didn't raise his principles, but his "democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that it was his time "based convictions that Assange was delivered to a third country and would not be subject to its procedures."
He also criticized the Swedish Justice, which he had requested to submit him to an audience in his country because of an acceptable sexual decline, while "the Swedish law speaking allows this through a video conference that could be carried out on the Ecuadors' message in London."
Correa explained that the danger was that the health and the psychic state of Assange would be affected.
"Before he was in our message, I didn't talk to him, however, the newspaper reported me that he had a lot of problem with the lengths, but there is no difficult problem," said the State Officer Ecuadors.
However, it takes the danger that he takes fleshly and psychic pains because he has been captured in a room and doesn't able to carry in freeness.
"This would be the health of all people," he added.
Correa said that the solution for the Asyl since June in the Ecuadors in London was given to the delivery of a free letter to go to Ecuador, and that it was in the hands of the British, Sweden, and the legal authorities of Europe. He understood that it was given to London to find a solution for the unexpected brothers of WikiLeaks.
We don't act with the human rights, we don't call this word for this case, however, we have always been talking.
"The solution for this problem is in the hands of the British, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe , since the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzons, leads a number of procedures to various European institutions."
And, "If the British's offering this free letter in the morning, this is my opinion."
And if Swedish Mrs Assange had heard the message of Ecuadors in London or about Skype, how it allowed the Swedish law to speak and in other cases, if the problem is done.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of the pressure freedom and said that what he does not tolerate, " the medicine, the evil view and the lies that obtained the free opinion."
"The greatest enemies of the price freedom are not the evil and perverse policy, but the evil journalists who strive and press for winning," he said.
In this sense he felt that Ecuador is not more of such journalists "and also will not be governed by the bankers or hegemonical and burgers," and he took up to a re-select "the revolution will be raised to continue the way in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain Veto against Paraguay in the Unsur at least to his next elections, as he argued that the organism must remain hart and no opportism and no legally covered State stats, because "the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."
The President Ecuadors also provides the desire of his Colombian Communities, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the Court of International Court of Justice of the Haag, which has committed the maritime State Almighty of Nicaragua, to negotiate the vital limits between both countries, "absolutely approved."
This judgment is not currently implemented.
It is a problem between a South and Central American State.
Conflicts are increasing, but they must be overwhelmed in a common way.
You need to be treated fully, so that you can overcome and look forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the fights on the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court and said, "This is right for Latin America to call international instances if both countries are committed to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard."
In relation to the possibility that he put himself as candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to achieve his third mandate, he said that he "to see this opportunity" with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa ensures that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would return from the political life.
The power has never interested me personally, but in such wrong circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the faith that I was who guaranteed this probable guidance, so I have to get this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as President, then I will get back from the public life.
This is also applied if we lose.
"This is resolved," he explained.
Correa also took the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Cuba.
I just talked to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he said to me that he was planned for a routine, routine treatment there, and that he would hope that he could go back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean an incident in the health situation of President Chavez," he commented.
The Ecuador State Team took today in Lima on 6th fields of the State and Government Boards of the Union in South America (Unasur) participating with the call to a higher regional integration to care for sustainable progress, equality and security.
A cause for a death for AIDS is today a too late recognition
Fabric was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result: HIV positive.
"It was like if a bomb was infected," he said about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor has tried to "avoid".
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his sickness alone and began to report about it; and this with such use he had just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is sure one of the elderly patients of the HIV unit of the hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several war 1994.
The manufacturer lives with human immuneficial virus (HIV) since 22 years, which was hard to imagine the beginning of the 90s, as many doubts, few possibilities of treatment and more stigmata.
At that time, the Director of an IMSS clinic was disappeared, 'cause it's led to a sack gas.'
At that time, AIDS was synonym for death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, there are still many people in the clinic that do not know anything about their disease and with which the virus has already established pains and has created their immune system, and the victims of opportunist infections are.
31 years after the appearance of the AIDS in the world, e.g. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes the treatment rightly, and the overliving of the general population is exactly the same," explained the leader of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that these information were held in April this year from an indicated scientific publication.
The expert for infectional diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS was not a dead judge, but the years of survival and the quality of life from the rate of the immune system of persons at the beginning of treatment, and that they had the greater chances that were not drug-dependents: to 30 years in a total of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a rate of 500 CCD4.
Simply said, the above executions mean that whoever receives HIV diagnosis in 25 years of age, in this meaning, "the problemless 75 years can be age while he is under control," explained the guy.
To make this progress correctly, it must be reminded that the life expectation of the Mexicans today is average of 76 years.
Even if death has been significantly reduced in the past years (in Mexico the number of persons died in AIDS, reduced from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the year report of UNUSIDA), is still true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60 per cent of the patients were dead in the national database.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and until May of this year there are 187 dead cases; however, there are universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why do people still die?
- I think it's not the problem of access to treatment.
This is my mind, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no disease problem with medicines. The problem is that people are in long progress because they don't know their infection status, such as in very later phases of the disease.
He makes a painful exhibition: "Neun of ten patients come to us if they have already a joint infection. To influence the global death, they are needed early diagnoses, because all people who need this should be offered massive recognition tests."
This proposal is the faculty and employees of the Council State of Prevention del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee for AIDS Confusion in Jalisco) and also the patients like the manufacturer who carried his test at a private labour, and this is the only reason that he had made a friend of him, while his young age was already in the AIDS phase, and even the Caposi-Sarcome (increased tumor), which is one of the common compliances.
It's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then I'll be threaten three times," says you in my case.
The amendment was to improve, I was good, driving sports and take the medicine.
He knows his parents today only that he had a crowd.
I live a normal life, like everybody else.
"I work, take a lot of business, I have a active, but the responsible sex lives, I assume my health and the other person," says Fabrio, which has agreed to share his intimate detail with MILLENIO JALISCO to animate with his witness those who today have fear of the worldwide AIDS day.
You should make the test if they are with risk groups. When they know whether they are HIV positive, it is better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how you can live as all people are responsible.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condome behind the ladentic
between the health programmes and the simply citizens are large lucks, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the HIV case.
And the most important is the prevention.
In certain places, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased; they have been separated by individuals, now they give us packages with hundred pieces that are good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
For the risks for new infections, the young people are numbered.
"What do you need that?" is a broad social workers, orientation personnel in schools, officers in apothics and health systems who don't want young people to take up, the Corresponder confirmed.
He proposed to reoriente this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be found behind the ladentic, but in output equipment in public toilettes of offices that are often visited by young people.
It is not necessary to promote promiscuity.
It should not be paid to them the beer and the Motel, as the Governor Emilio González answered whether it would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't seem so; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who have already done a sexual action," he brought it to the point.
Jalisco key data
There are 13.435 collibrated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is considered nationally in 4 of new and compulsed AIDS cases, and on 13. HIV.
92% of the exploitation cases result on sexual trade, 6% over blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who don't know.
After the Executive Court of the United States confirmed a judge that the restructuring of the Vitro group's obligations that have been reached on a trade competition in Mexico will create an insufficient preventive case for each national enterprise with reductions in the neighbor country.
So it may be possible to say that the procedures to survive the companies that permit the Mexico laws have no validity in the country of stars and streps in contrast to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the jurisdiction held on 15 June by the judge Harlin Hale in the Court of Bancarrotas for the North District in Texas to help meet the Mexican companies to be applied to their own property inside the River Bravo.
However, the decision opens the greatest glass manufacturer in Mexico door and door to call the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistences.
While the judges of the matter indicate that the believers should be subject to the competitive law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Court first says that it is in New Orleans' main procedure for the trade competition treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in procedures for payment incapable of enterprises with a transitional profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations’s Model Service for the Union of the International Trade Rights has been created in this purpose, while the American Law Institute was used as a slower.
Secondly, the jurisdiction is that without the votes of the society under recognition of the competences in the competitive mass which had the Vitro-filials with their mother's company would not be achieved the necessary majority for the restructuring of obligations.
However, this opportunity is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was allowed.
There are half thousand examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicona, which have been confirmed by the group of the Federal Institute of Concursos Mercantiles (Agency for Trade Concuses).
It is also true that, after the votes of the Filials, the faithers of Vitro, the faithful men who claimed to the Courts of the United States against Vitro, the Geier Funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited.
The vote would have exceeded 45% against 37%.
This is not considered by the Executive Court.
On the other hand, there is Vitro Schuld for his difficult situation since 2008, in the framework of the great economic crisis in the United States, which has given the country's ships.
For this reason, the family González Sada sets the same employment judge in order to follow the vote in plenary, such as by all judges, because only three of them were abstind.
If it is not placed, the Cerciorare Agreement requested to check the procedure by a higher instance, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious case is that the Court has received a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figure friends curiae (Firund of the Court), which is described by Vitro in the framework of the Act on Trade Concurrences, and indicated that it had been stretched to the agreements signed by both countries to respect the Chapter 15 of the Concurrence of the United States.
It is also indicated that the country has submitted the principles of the Commission of the United Nations for international trade, such as the rules set for the cases of limited payment that ensure the comparison of criminals and faithers.
Two-based caramboles: a struggle for Vitro and for the country.
General Bilance
After the mexican trade industry against the old property of Gaston Azcarraga Andrade, which is accused of a professional administration, the Association Sindical de Pilotos Aviators has finally progressed.
Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now committed a criminal procedure against the National Bank and Values Paper Committee, which is proposed to prevent justice.
Afterward, the supervisory Authority refused systematicly to inform the main administration of the Republic about a transaction carried out by the companies to reject the entirely entirely F/589 of the Bank IXE on the name of Mexican de Aviation 198 million Pesos.
These measures were used for the construction of the administrative professional de hotels (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main actor of the Posadas hotel.
Dragon Mart is turned out
At a weekend meeting on a forum of the Caribbean University, a group of national and external environmental protectors, academic, employees and general members of the citizen society decided to establish a wide forum to refuse the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a large vessel and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, full of an apartment for 150 companies.
In the field, Canazintra (the national room of the processing industry) has obtained to join the governments in the southern countries to reduce the monumental institutions that are destroyed in the part of the protected areas and the mother of all the income of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Since the Government of a request of the Senate to explain, in which conditions and conditions of the Mexican Messengers in Japan signed the anti-counterfeiting Agreement, which is known under the English decoration of ACTA, is the question already archived in accordance with the Mexican Institute for intellectual property.
As you know, these measures have been followed, although the senate had taken the opportunity outside consideration, because he considered them as an excuse against the free opinion of the social networks.
Homex long-term
In order to pay long-term connections without avoiding the short-term obligations, the Homex Building Certificates brings more than 500 million Pesos on the market.
The emission is the first of four equal emissions promised a payment every 28 days.
Competival funding
NYCE, e-quality and kernet companies, leading to the information technology, were based on a company group under the label of Competival, which is the purpose of the service market of the software Cluster in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are more than $1,5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bummler of the basketball, Hector "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the corbsport longer than 60 years and prepared the whole world.
Many in Puerto Rico are available on a large spiritual collection of the history of the basketball story of the country like Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was connected by an accident in 2008 to the role role, Rexes was a part of this sport six years, as a lower class player, player of the first national ligue, compliant and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Verband.
"My life I have set a lot of rooms in the basketball, even in the same time when I was President of the BSN, a major employer of the National Ministry and President of the Conference in the 90s," Reyes remembered when a visit of Primera Hora with him in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife since more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exceed this exhibition.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and reminders of his long carriers and test them.
Bayamon in heart
The most emotional reminders are those who remember at his time at Vaqueros from the middle of 50 years as players to 1982, where he feeded his 15-year-old jubilee as officer or business manager of the club.
"There were my best years I have been gained most, because I had a part of eight Masters of Vaqueros since 1967 as a business leader, employer or trainer.
There were many fulfilled years, including the five Masterships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I agreed with a mastership in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debt in BSN.
From then, he took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as trainer and was established in the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said, "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended the freedomspezialist Raymond Gausse, who was involving citizens and was one of our best community.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a mastership for Bayamon, the gas would be worried for another.
The Mastership of Vaqueros with Gauss was delivered to him, but he was already out of a distance because he already standed on the top of the conference.
At that time, he proposed to enjoy his full-tracks and the Mincy in the National Assembly.
I still know when we win the first time in the preolymptic tourism in Mexico against the United States.
After that, the World Mastership came in 1990, where we considered the fourth place, what should really be the bronze, if this Canadian shoe judge would not be, who left us the last game to the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the World Republic of 1990 the best national community you have ever seen?
She is the best, as well as those who win in the Olympiad 2004 against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the manage of the American games 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold, and the United States team made a fight, as when they won against us in the world's majority Bronze.
With these menages, there were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francico and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, which was not able to be there because of a sneeper loss.
A manner that may not be the best of personality, but we win a goldmedail and prepared a great joy was that of the forolymptic tourniers 1995 in New Queen, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" News, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as replacement for the locked players because of the presences on the American games in Mar Del Plata, we won every prognose of gold medaille.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was unbelievablely Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers on the level of international tourners are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Picullin.
And this, without looking at his travel in the different lines he played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work well from the boys.
What do you think it's the best you got in the connection?
I was part of the successful Era of the national society from 1988 to 1995, which the BSN began 90 to 17 men in a saison.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I had to introduce, such as the regionalization of the under-categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, play only in their area and only take place in the national players on manages from other branches of the island.
Today, children make a lot of travels and games unnecessary.
At least, I see the result of the proposed trainers and curses for trainers, table-officials and smoking judges.
That's why I'm honourable.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of my time in YouTube, enjoy my angel kids and go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoyed my wife Isabel's society, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas), and it was worldwide blessed with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the TV series "Dallas", where he played a rolled, home-to-handed employer.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oilmagnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" was dead to a symbol of the Hamgier of the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new staff of "Dallas", died free afternoon because of blood compulsions according to a pre-partition of the family in The Associated Press by Warner Bros., manufacturer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his loved town Dallas, where he again played the iconical role that most liked him," said the family.
The family of Larry and his worst friends were with him in Dallas for the feasts of the hard Dance Feast.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and consequences, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas' hospital, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joys who knew him.
He was creative, great, joyful, nice, lovely and talented, and I'll miss him very much.
"He was a original person and lived the life in full shoes," said Gray in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed 1992 Leberzirrhose, and he gave that he had drinked a lot over years.
1995 was established a bad tumor in his body, and he was submitted to a transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known in the TV as low type in the 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the NBC TV.
There he played the astronauts Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he triffs an attractive "Dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him home.
He was also a dealer of two comédias that were just a short time exhausted, such as the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His kinoworks are well evaluated roles in the "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his greatest interpretation of J.R., the Hagman made a superstar.
The dramatic series of the TV CBS on the Ewing Clan and other figures in their area were exhausted from April 1978 to May 1991.
The term "Who shocks on J.R.?", the expectation of an episode of full emotions, where Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were in concurrent houses.
That the series had a supervisor record in that time.
When the answer was recognised in a chapter of November 1990, it was seen by average 41 million visitors, which changed the "Dallas" in the second of the most viewed discussion programme since the end of "MASH" 1983, the 50 million supervisors.
It was Kristin, J.R.'s sweeter (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. was able to show her as prostituted if she didn't leave the city, but there were other reasons to see him died.
Hagman interpreted the role of the ewing as a corrupt, unmarried man with a charismatic dream: a low-treated employer and untrusted husband who then tried to show his alcohol sick wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on the grave of J.R.," said Hagman 1988.
It should be called "Hier rests the honorable citizens J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, the Mediterranean of the original series, reminded Hagman's freedom as a "enorme person on and outside the screen".
He is for millions of persecutors in the world incomprehensive and unseen and remains to us who had the happiness to know and love him in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new output of "Dallas" were exhausted a few months ago with great success in the TNT television channel.
The arrest of five chapters for the second staff was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, reported by the Sender.
The warner or TNT had no statement on how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Birthing in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of shoes and songer Mary Martin, the classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a young man when she got Larry during her marriage with a lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried to be happy on the theatre bowls in New York in the beginning of the 50 years, then he served from 1952 to 1956 in the aircraft forces in England.
There he learned the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many officers had their inhabitants.
2001 he tituled his memories "Hello Darlin: Tall (and absolutely true) Tales about My Life."
"I have written nothing from which I believed that it could hurt someone or be inquired to any wisdom," said the Associated Press on his time.
After the liver transplantation, he set himself for liver cups and worked as freeer in a hospital in order to contribute to anxiety patients.
"I steal them, give them encouragement, I will take me with them when their operations are prevented and then," he explained 1996.
I want to send them some suffering, like, "no fear, it's a little unbelievers the first time, but it's gonna be good for you."
He also set himself against the smoking, and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the curses who studies the "End of the World"
Every week, study students apocalyptic theme, such as the atomic war, zombies, virus and Keime and the global consideration.
Each semester, when the religious professor decided to stop a course over the end of the world, knew that he had been available on an increasing range: the end of the "lange back mount" of the Maya calendar on 21 December, of which many people believed that it was the end of the world.
But Charme had no idea what he should expect in the following two months: the destroyer Hurrikan Sandy, which some were called "Deudarmageddon", and a growing conflict under the participation of Israel, the place of which the Christian theoretics believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that has ever given it," said Charme this week to students at the University of Rutgers Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what happened today in the world, as if we were disappeared for 30 days from it, this would be a really good period.
And he remembers that the evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only Professor that this semester, who really should be the last in the history, offers the course of the "End of the World".
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker provides the course "Medians, Culture and the end of the world."
Every week, study students apocalyptic theme, such as the atomic war, zombies, virus and Keime and the global consideration.
"We analyze why these ideas are expanded with the time," he said, "and the kind and way, how hypothetic scenarios are offered to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear materials are in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could be destroyed.
This month the students analysed films with apocalyptic content and studied how they were compared with the real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, faithful and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the Professor for Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a professional professor for artist history and anthropology, made a team to offer a curs with the hard sign "The end of the world".
"We don't take 2012 to keep the option to stop the course again, for the case that the world doesn't be understood," said the Restaurant.
The students must study, create projects, and participate in final tests.
In Penn State, the conclusion test will be carried out at the end of the Apocalypse, because the students have no other chance than "to continue to work for the night where the world is able to end," said Retal.
The curses were very loved.
"In two hours there was no place more," he said to retal on his course for students with high average, who filled with 35 students.
We received e-mails from students who asked whether the place was free.
Students ensure that the course is numbered to the interesters.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to rejoice themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Chambers for religion and socialology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sections or religionmentality is actually only a question of suffering or losses.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa explains that all apocalyptic films have seen.
"I have never heard something of a teaching where this is going to be learned," he said.
I'm happy.
But no one of the students asked - and less than one professor - explained to believe in the last date of 21 December.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of Mayas, and in certain ways we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student in the last year in Temple, 21 years old and West Chester.
Mayas never said the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, says restoral.
He notes, however, that in the western society there is a apocalyptic fear that returns several centuries when people react to changes in their environment with the prevention of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Otherwise people don't think so," he said.
This is mostly in the English world of the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor of the University of La Salle, who teaches this year on the Philippines, answers quickly to the question if he knew a curs about the "End of the World".
"The Philippines don't participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an exceeding higher instance.
We have a pleasure to the dad.
Recently, that over the years, many days were spoken from the last court, and he said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people will immediately think of a new date" or philosophy, that the beginning of a seven-year period of the end of the world is coming.
Students and professionals take this date easy.
Many said that they want to go to feast over the end of the world.
"I may call a couple of friends to we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-year-old student for communications.
